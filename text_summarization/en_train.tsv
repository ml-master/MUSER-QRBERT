President Joe Biden on Friday will present the Medal of Honor for the first time since he took office, honoring a U.S. veteran of the Korean War for his "conspicuous gallantry," the White House said. South Korean President Moon Jae-In, who is visiting the White House that day for talks with Biden, is scheduled to attend the ceremony, according to the White House. The recipient of the nation's highest military award, Col. Ralph Puckett Jr., is a resident of Columbus, Georgia, who served in the Korean War and the Vietnam War, the White House said in a press release.	President Joe Biden on Friday will present the Medal of Honor for the first time since he took office, honoring a U.S. veteran of the Korean War for his "conspicuous gallantry," the White House said. South Korean President Moon Jae-In, who is visiting the White House that day for talks with Biden , is scheduled to attend the ceremony, according to the White House. The recipient of the nation's highest military award, Col. Ralph Puckett Jr., is a resident of Columbus, Georgia, who served in the Korean War and the Vietnam War, the White House said in a press release. Puckett "distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty" in Korea in November 1950 by leading a unit of Army Rangers into a harrowing daylight attack on an enemy hill, the White House said. "To obtain supporting fire, First Lieutenant Puckett mounted the closest tank, exposing himself to the deadly enemy fire," the White House said. "Leaping from the tank, he shouted words of encouragement to his men and began to lead the Rangers in the attack." When enemy fire pinned down a platoon, Puckett left the relative safety of his position and "intentionally ran across an open area three times to draw enemy fire, thereby allowing the Rangers to locate and destroy the enemy positions and to seize Hill 205." "During the course of the night, the enemy launched a counterattack which lasted four hours," the press release said, adding that Puckett's leadership motivated the Rangers throughout. "As a result, five human wave attacks by a battalion strength enemy element were repulsed," the White House said. Puckett was injured by grenade fragments during the first of those waves, "but he refused evacuation and continually directed artillery support that decimated attacking enemy formations, repeatedly abandoned positions of relative safety to make his way from foxhole to foxhole to check the company's perimeter, and distributed ammunition amongst the Rangers," the White House said. On the sixth wave of attack, two mortar rounds landed in Puckett's foxhole, causing "grievous wounds," the press release said. "First Lieutenant Puckett commanded the Rangers to leave him behind and evacuate the area. Feeling a sense of duty to aid him, the Rangers refused the order and staged an effort to retrieve him from the foxhole while still under harassing fire from the enemy." "Ultimately, the Rangers succeeded in retrieving First Lieutenant Puckett and they moved to the bottom of the hill, where First Lieutenant Puckett called for devastating artillery fire on the top of the enemy controlled hill," the White House said. Puckett enlisted in the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps in 1943 and was discharged to the U.S. Military Academy in 1945. He served in the Korean War as a member of the 8th Army Ranger Company and in Vietnam as a member of the 101st Airborne Division.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline has been a "wakeup call" for U.S. cybersecurity vulnerability. Colonial is still struggling with a cybersecurity attack that forced its entire system offline Friday and triggered widespread fuel shortages across the Southeast. Buttigieg's remarks come a day after President Biden signed an executive order to help strengthen U.S. cybersecurity defenses.	Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Thursday the ransomware attack on the operator of the country's largest fuel pipeline has been a "wakeup call" for U.S. cybersecurity vulnerability. Colonial Pipeline is still struggling with a cybersecurity attack that forced its entire system offline last Friday and triggered widespread fuel shortages in the Southeast. The company restarted operations Wednesday afternoon but said the system won't return to normal for several days. "This has been a wakeup call on how actors anywhere in the world can impact us right here at home," Buttigieg said during an interview on CNBC's " Squawk Box ." He added that the all-of-government response to the hack has "really paid off." Buttigieg's remarks came a day after President Joe Biden signed an executive order to help strengthen U.S. cybersecurity defenses. The president's order calls on the federal government and private sector to work together to combat "persistent and increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber campaigns" that threaten the U.S. The Department of Energy has led the federal response to the attack in coordination with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. Buttigieg said the response has included weight limit waivers for tanker trucks to help ease shortage concerns, as well as increased flexibility in allowing workers to conduct manual inspections. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Thursday morning that Colonial's pipeline restart "went well overnight." "This should mean things will return to normal by the end of the weekend," Granholm wrote in a tweet. Colonial's shutdown led to panic buying in some Southeastern states and pushed the national average for a gallon of gas above $3 for the first time since 2014. Colonial shut off its system as a proactive measure after falling victim to the attack by a cyber criminal group known as DarkSide . The company's pipeline spans 5,500 miles from Houston to New Jersey and carries almost half of the fuel supply on the East Coast, including gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil and jet fuel. Gas outages continue to hit the Southeast, with more more than half of stations in South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia without fuel, according to data Thursday from GasBuddy. — CNBC's Pippa Stevens contributed reporting
President Joe Biden says he wants to see a corporate tax rate "between 25 and 28" percent. The 25% rate was the most concrete outline Biden has offered so far as a potential compromise he would make to fund his major infrastructure bill. The 25% rate has already been endorsed by West Virginia's Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, whose vote Democrats will need if the infrastructure bill is to have any chance of becoming law.	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Thursday said he wants to see a corporate tax rate "between 25 and 28" percent, setting down a new marker in the ongoing negotiations over how to fund a major infrastructure bill. "The way I can pay for this is making sure that the largest companies don't pay zero, and reducing the [2017 corporate] tax cut to between 25[%] and 28[%]," Biden said at an event in Louisiana. "That's a couple hundred billion dollars, and we can pay for these things." The remarks were the first time Biden had explicitly acknowledged that his initial proposal of raising the corporate tax rate to 28%, up from the current rate of 21%, was shifting amid negotiations on the massive infrastructure bill. Dubbed the American Jobs Plan, Biden's signature domestic policy bill would invest $2 trillion into rebuilding vast parts of the U.S. infrastructure, from roads and bridges to expanded broadband. Biden has pledged to fund the bill without adding to the federal deficit, largely by raising the corporate tax rate that was slashed as part of the Trump administration's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The 25% rate has already been endorsed by West Virginia's Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, the one lawmaker who will likely have the most control over the fate of the bill, provided Biden can't coax any of Manchin's Republican colleagues to support it. So far, Republicans in Congress have said that any changes at all to the 2017 tax cuts bill would amount to a red line for the GOP. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell this week predicted that Biden would not garner a single Republican vote for the American Jobs Plan, or for its companion bill, the education and family-focused American Families Plan. A White House spokeswoman said earlier Thursday that negotiations are continuing this week between the White House and lawmakers in both parties over the specifics of the infrastructure package. Republicans have released the outlines of a counteroffer, proposing a narrow infrastructure bill that's a quarter the size of the Biden plan. It has yet to receive serious consideration. Speaking against the backdrop of the aging Calcasieu River Bridge in Lake Charles on Thursday, Biden also signaled that he intends to press Republicans into the difficult political position of having to publicly choose protecting their 2017 corporate tax cuts over creating thousands of blue-collar jobs. "This is all about making a choice, a choice between giving tax breaks to the super wealthy and to corporations, and investing in working families," he said. Despite the partisan jabs, Biden insisted that he is still open to negotiating a bipartisan agreement with Republicans, before attempting to pass the infrastructure bill on a pure party-line vote. "I'm ready to compromise. What I'm not ready to do, I'm not ready to do nothing," said Biden. "I'm not ready to have another period where America has another 'infrastructure month' and doesn't change a damn thing."
The family of Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot while participating in the pro-Trump invasion of the U.S. Capitol, plans to sue the police department and the officer who fired the gun for at least $10 million. News of the forthcoming lawsuit came more than two weeks after the Justice Department said it would not file criminal charges against the officer who killed Babbitt. Terrell Roberts, an attorney for the Babbitt family, told CNBC it had not been determined when, or in which court, the civil lawsuit against the U.S. Capitol Police would be filed.	The family of Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot while participating in the Jan. 6 invasion of the U.S. Capitol, plans to sue the police department and the officer who fired the gun for at least $10 million. News of the forthcoming lawsuit, first reported by Newsweek , came more than two weeks after the Justice Department said it would not file criminal charges against the officer who killed Babbitt . Terrell Roberts, an attorney for the Babbitt family, told CNBC on Thursday that it had not been determined when, or in which court, the civil lawsuit against the U.S. Capitol Police would be filed. The $10 million figure, Roberts said, is an estimate of financial losses that includes the value of Babbitt's "services to her husband and combined with Ashli's potential income if she would have lived." "A potential for recovery for non-pecuniary losses is also factored in the amount," Roberts said. Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was among the mob of hundreds of supporters of former President Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, derailing Congress' efforts to confirm President Joe Biden's electoral victory. The invasion, which followed Trump insisting at a nearby rally that his followers should march to the Capitol and pressure Republicans not to accept the results of the election, forced USCP to evacuate federal lawmakers. The invasion resulted in five deaths. Babbitt and a group of rioters gained access to a hallway outside the Speaker's Lobby, which leads to the House chamber. She tried to climb head first through the broken glass window of a door separating the hallway from the lobby, which had been barricaded from the inside with furniture. Other members of the crowd had broken out chunks of glass on the doors while pounding on them "with their hands, flagpoles, helmets, and other objects," the Justice Department said. Babbitt was shot once in the left shoulder by an officer inside the lobby who had drawn his service pistol. She fell backward onto the floor. She was transported to Washington Hospital Center, where she died, the DOJ said. The agency announced April 14 that it had closed the investigation into the shooting and would not bring criminal charges against the officer, who has not been publicly identified. The family objected to the DOJ's decision and vowed to pursue civil action. Roberts said that he will serve a notice to the USCP "within the next 10 days" declaring his intent to file a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., federal court, Newsweek reported Thursday.
President Biden is pledging to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030, in the latest push by the administration to aggressively combat climate change. The target more than doubles the country's prior commitment under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The announcement comes before the president hosts a closely watched climate summit on Thursday's Earth Day, with world leaders from countries like China and India.	President Joe Biden is pledging to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% by 2030, in the latest push by the administration to aggressively combat climate change . The target, announced Thursday, more than doubles the country's prior commitment under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, when the Obama administration set out to cut emissions 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. The U.S. is currently not yet halfway to meeting that goal. Biden's pledge on Earth Day is in line with what environmental groups and hundreds of executives at major companies have pushed for. The president announce the target at the closely watched global leaders' climate summit on Thursday, during which he hopes to urge global cooperation to address the climate crisis. "This is the decisive decade," Biden said at the summit on Thursday morning. "This is the decade that we must make decisions to avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis." "This is a moral imperative. An economic imperative. A moment of peril, but also a moment of extraordinary possibilities," the president said. All 40 world leaders the president invited to the virtual summit will be attending, including those from China and India, and are anticipated to make new commitments. The U.K. and European Union have committed to slash emissions by 68% and 55%, respectively, by 2030. China, the world's biggest emitter, has vowed to reach peak emissions by 2030 and be carbon neutral by 2060. During the summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping repeated the country's previous commitments and emphasized green development and multilateralism to reduce global emissions. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for concrete action on climate change and announced an India-U.S. Climate and Clean Energy Agenda Partnership for 2030. He also re-confirmed the nation's vow to install 450 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030. Japan's prime minister Yoshihide Suga announced a stricter emissions target of 46% reduction by 2030. Canada also updated its target and vowed to reduce 2005 emission levels by 40-45% by 2030. The summit is a chance for the U.S. to rejoin global efforts on climate after then-President Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris accord, halted all federal efforts to reduce domestic emissions and rolled back more than 100 environmental regulations to favor fossil fuel production. "I'm delighted to see that the United States is back, is back to work together with us in climate politics," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said during the summit. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who this week announced that Britain would slash emissions by 78% by 2035, praised Biden "for returning the United States to the front rank of the fight against climate change." "It's vital for all of us to show that this is not all about some expensive politically correct, green act of bunny hugging," Johnson said. "This is about growth and jobs." Biden's pledge also moves forward his campaign promise to decarbonize the country's energy sector by 2030 and put the country on a path to net-zero emissions by midcentury. Biden so far has proposed a $2 trillion infrastructure package that would aid a transition away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy, while promising to create green jobs. If passed, the legislation would be one of the largest federal efforts ever to reduce emissions. "A strong national emissions reduction target is just what we need to catalyze a net-zero emissions future and build back a more equitable and inclusive economy," Anne Kelly, vice president of government relations at sustainability nonprofit Ceres, said in a statement. In order to achieve a net-zero economy by 2050, the U.S. must curb emissions by 57% to 63% in the next decade, according to an analysis by Climate Action Tracker, an independent group that analyzes various government climate pledges. This week's summit also comes ahead of a major U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, in November, during which nations in the Paris agreement will unveil updated emissions targets for the next decade. Under the accord, countries are trying to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with preindustrial levels. However, the Earth is on track to warm up by 1.5 degrees Celsius , or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, in the next two decades. And it could see temperatures rise over 3 degrees Celsius, or 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit, this century without global action. Flavio Lehner, a climate scientist and assistant professor of earth and atmospheric science at Cornell University, said that while it's ambitious, Biden's pledge is likely not enough to reach targets under the Paris accord. Global temperature rise also depends largely on what other countries pledge in the next decade. "Many climate impacts scale almost linearly with warming, so reducing emissions as fast as possible has to remain a key sustained motivation for this and future administrations, irrespective of a particular warming target," Lehner said.
Attorney General Merrick Garland rescinded Trump-era limits on consent decrees. He said the DOJ will restore the process that was in place before former President Trump's AG Jeff Sessions imposed sharp restrictions on the civil rights tool. As a presidential candidate, President Biden vowed to reverse Sessions' policy changes.	Attorney General Merrick Garland on Friday rescinded Trump-era limits on consent decrees, which the Department of Justice has used to enforce reforms in police departments accused of widespread misconduct. Garland, fulfilling a campaign promise from President Joe Biden , said in a memorandum that the Justice Department "will return to the traditional process" that was in place before former President Donald Trump 's administration imposed sharp restrictions on the civil rights tool. "Together, we will continue the Department's legacy of promoting the rule of law, protecting the public, and working collaboratively with state and local governmental entities to meet those ends," Garland said in the memo, which was sent to U.S. attorneys and other DOJ leaders. The policy reversal comes amid historically fraught relations between police departments and Black communities. A series of fatalities involving police within the past year, particularly the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, set off waves of nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism. Derek Chauvin, the white former police officer who knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes before he died, is on trial facing murder charges. The recent shooting death near Minneapolis of Daunte Wright , a 20-year-old Black man, has sparked more protests in Minnesota. Consent decrees are court-ordered agreements that can be used to resolve violations of the law or systemic misconduct discovered during federal investigations of state or local law enforcement agencies. For instance, after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, the DOJ launched an investigation of the Ferguson Police Department for "an alleged pattern or practice of unlawful misconduct" and other issues. Less than a year later, the DOJ said it found "a number of patterns or practices of unconstitutional conduct." A federal judge in April 2016 approved the consent decree between Ferguson and the DOJ, which required broad changes at the police department. Just before he was fired by Trump in November 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions signed a memo curtailing the Justice Department's use of consent decrees. Sessions' changes included requiring that consent decrees must be approved by senior leadership, and that they must include an expiration date, rather than being in place until the court deems the case can be terminated. "I am rescinding the November 2018 Memorandum," Garland said in his memo. As a presidential candidate, Biden vowed that under his administration the DOJ "will again use its authority to root out unconstitutional or unlawful policing."
Wall Street executives, their employees and trade associations invested at least $2.9 billion into political initiatives during the 2020 election cycle, according to a new research report. The study, by Americans for Financial Reform, describes a historic effort by those within banks and other financial groups to contribute to campaigns and lobbying policies. The $2.9 billion outlay works out to almost $4 million a day throughout the cycle, according to the new report.	Wall Street executives, their employees and trade associations invested at least $2.9 billion into political initiatives during the 2020 election cycle, according to a new research report. The study, first shared with CNBC and authored by Americans for Financial Reform, paints a historic effort by those within banks and various other financial services firms to contribute to campaigns and lobbying policies being crafted in Washington, D.C. The report says that it was the most spending by those in the financial services sector in an election cycle since the 2016 presidential contest. At that time, financiers spent $2 billion on similar efforts. The $2.9 billion outlay works out to almost $4 million a day throughout the cycle, according to the new report. The study combined lobbying and campaign contributions from 2019 through 2020. Part of the group's methodology focused on contributions and lobbying spending by those in the FIRE sector, which focuses on the finance, insurance and real estate industries. "Year in and year out, this torrent of money gives Wall Street an outsized role in how we are governed, while driving and protecting policies that help this industry's super wealthy amass even greater fortunes at the expense of the rest of us," Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, told CNBC in a statement. There's also a section that shows the Republican lawmakers who received the most from the financial sector during the election who later objected to confirming the Electoral College results in the wake of the deadly Jan. 6 riot on Capitol Hill. The report says that individuals and campaign entities linked to the financial sector contributed just more than $1.9 billion toward backing candidates running for federal office, including over $74 million that went to supporting President Joe Biden's run for president. Of the $1.9 billion, 47% went to Republicans and 53% went to Democrats. In fact, this report notes that more than $250 million from those working in the FIRE sector went toward supporting Biden , the most out of all the contenders for president. Those contributions were a mix of donations to his campaign and outside groups supporting him. Former President Donald Trump , on the other hand, saw just over $103 million from those same industries. Another key to the study is the amount of lobbying that was done by those in the financial sector during the election cycle. Financial firms and their associated groups spent more than $932 million during that time period. The top 20 financial firms and trade associations that lobbied and had employees or their PACs contribute to candidates include Blackstone, Charles Schwab, Susquehanna International, the American Bankers Association, Bain Capital and Renaissance Technologies. Senators who combined to receive over $300 million from those in the financial sector include the campaigns of Sens. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Raphael Warnock, D-Ga. The top banking trade associations combined to invest just more than $53 million on contributions and lobbying expenditures. As for the House GOP lawmakers who challenged the results of the Electoral College in January, the report shows the top recipients of Wall Street money in that category include, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., Reps. Steve Scalise, R-La., Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., and Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. Senate Republicans who challenged the election results and also saw their campaigns infused with similar cash include Sens. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., Roger Marshall, R-Kan., Rick Scott, R-Fla., Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and John Kennedy, R-La.
A bipartisan group of House lawmakers is trying to repeal the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions passed as part of the 2017 Republican tax law. Some of the representatives are trying to include the change in President Joe Biden's infrastructure plan, which could potentially jeopardize its passage. Analyses have estimated the change would disproportionately help wealthy taxpayers, but supporters of repealing the cap said it will help the middle class, as well.	A group of House members on Thursday applied more pressure to repeal the state and local tax deduction cap, as the policy emerges as a possible stumbling block in efforts to pass President Joe Biden 's infrastructure plan. Lawmakers from both parties announced the SALT caucus, which aims to scrap the $10,000 limit on state and local deductions set as part of the 2017 Republican tax law. The roughly 30 House members in the group largely represent the high-tax states of New York, New Jersey and California. Members of Congress from those states have pushed to get rid of the tax deduction cap since the GOP passed it. The formation of the caucus shows repealing the policy has gained traction, even as lawmakers in both parties oppose the change and question whether it will help wealthy taxpayers most. A handful of lawmakers have tied the push to repeal the limit to Democrats' next legislative priority: a more than $2 trillion infrastructure and jobs package. Democratic Reps. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and Tom Suozzi of New York — co-chairs of the new group — and Bill Pascrell of New Jersey have said they "will not accept any changes to the tax code that do not restore the SALT deduction." As Democrats hold a narrow 218-212 majority in the House, their potential opposition to an infrastructure bill would jeopardize its passage. It is unclear now how many members of the SALT caucus would make repealing the cap a condition of supporting an infrastructure plan. "You've been hearing a lot about SALT in relation to the infrastructure bill," Suozzi said on Thursday, but "not everybody's in the same place" on including it in the legislation. Others including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, whose state of New York is one of those most helped by scrapping the cap, have pushed to get rid of the deduction limit. Doing so as part of the infrastructure bill, though, would create issues for the party. Biden has called to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% and deter offshoring of business profits to offset the infrastructure spending. Repealing the SALT deduction cap would cost the federal government money and leave Congress with another financing gap to make up. Asked Wednesday about getting rid of the limit, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration wanted to hear more ideas about how to pay for the infrastructure package. Many progressive Democrats and Republicans alike have criticized efforts to repeal the SALT deduction limit. Nearly all of the tax cut from getting rid of the cap – 96% – would go to the top 20% of American households, the Tax Policy Center estimated in 2018. More than half of the benefit would fall to the top 1% of households, the analysis found. Supporters of repealing the cap on Thursday disputed the notion that it would help wealthier Americans the most. "This is affecting middle-class families in my district," Gottheimer said.

The Biden administration imposed a raft of new sanctions against Moscow on Thursday over alleged 2020 election interference and cyberattacks. The sanctions target more than three dozen entities and individuals, according to the Treasury Department. The measures come following President Joe Biden's phone call this week with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and as Russian forces amass near the Ukraine border.	The Biden administration imposed a raft of new sanctions against Moscow on Thursday over alleged interference in the 2020 election, a colossal cyberattack against U.S. government and corporate networks, illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea, and human rights abuses. "Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) took sweeping action against 16 entities and 16 individuals who attempted to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election at the direction of the leadership of the Russian Government," the Treasury said in a statement. It also announced sanctions on five individuals and three entities linked to Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and human rights abuses. In addition to the broad sanctions issued by the Treasury, the State Department announced it will expel 10 officials from Russia's diplomatic mission in the United States. The sanctions come following President Joe Biden's phone call this week with Russian leader Vladimir Putin , and as Russian force amass near the Ukraine border. Washington formally accused Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR — its top spy agency — of being behind the SolarWinds cyberattack publicized late last year, described by Microsoft President Brad Smith as " the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen ." "The U.S. Intelligence Community has high confidence in its assessment of attribution," the Treasury release said. The attack saw hackers gain access to the software used by thousands of government bureaus and companies. The penalties are also in response to a March report by the U.S. director of national intelligence that concluded Putin authorized attempts to interfere in the 2020 election in former President Donald Trump 's favor. The Russian government denies all of the allegations. Biden also signed an executive order Thursday that allows Washington to sanction any sector of Moscow's economy, significantly broadening the scope of sanctions authority. Under this new authorization, U.S. financial institutions are prohibited from conducting transactions in the primary market for new ruble or non-ruble-denominated bonds issued after June 14. "When you remove U.S. investors from the primary market, it causes a broader chilling effect," said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "What you see is that Russia's borrowing costs rise, you see that there's capital flight and you see the currency weakens in tandem. And you know, that has an impact on Russia's growth rate and it has an impact on Russia's inflation rate," the official added. "The President signed this sweeping new authority to confront Russia's continued and growing malign behavior," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement applauding the measure. "Treasury is leveraging this new authority to impose costs on the Russian government for its unacceptable conduct, including by limiting Russia's ability to finance its activities and by targeting Russia's malicious and disruptive cyber capabilities," she added. One of those named in the new actions is Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian agent with ties to former Trump campaign boss Paul Manafort , who was convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The FBI is offering $250,000 for information leading to Kilimnik's arrest, who is believed to be in Russia. Moscow prohibits the extradition of a Russian national to any country. Another senior administration official, who declined to be named, said that the White House was still hopeful for a "stable and predictable relationship" with Russia. "We also want to be clear that we have no desire to be in an escalatory cycle with Russia, we intend these responses to be proportionate and tailored to the specific past activities, paths, actions that Russia has taken," the official said. The administration officials declined to speculate on possible retaliatory actions Moscow would take on the heels of the sweeping sanctions. Taking a tougher stance on Russia was one of Biden's foreign policy campaign pledges. The measures announced Thursday join a series of past moves: the Obama administration's debt financing restrictions for major Russian companies like Rosneft, and the Trump administration's ban on U.S. entities buying Russia's foreign currency government loans. "Today's U.S. sanctions continue the general trend of worsening relations witnessed ever since the annexation of Crimea," Maximilian Hess, head of political risk at London-based advisory firm Hawthorn Advisors, told CNBC. "The key portion" of these sanctions, he said, "is the barring of U.S. entities from the primary market for ruble-denominated debts by the Russian government." However, Hess noted, this "will not have a major impact, particularly given Russia's manageable debt load." For Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, the measures are far from harsh. "It's like guys, come on, you need to do better than this," Ash wrote in a note following the announcement. "Sovereign primary still allows U.S. entities to hold this debt. So U.S. institutions cannot buy Russian sovereign debt in primary issuance, but can get their Russian bank friends to buy it for them in primary, give them a fee, and then buy it in the secondary." The ruble pared some of its losses Thursday against the greenback shortly after the sanctions news, trading at 76.3025 to the dollar at 4 p.m. local time compared with 77.0718 just before the details of the sanctions were announced. The Biden-Putin call Tuesday, at least the second between the two men since Biden took office in January, comes as the United States and other Western countries grow weary of Russia's growing military buildup along its border with Ukraine, where it has amassed tens of thousands of troops and tanks. "We're now seeing the largest concentration of Russian forces on Ukraine's borders since 2014," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday after visiting NATO's headquarters in Brussels. "That is a deep concern not only to Ukraine, but to the United States." Regional experts say this move could be an attempt to test Biden's mettle and intimidate Ukraine; the more pessimistic outlook suggests its aim is to goad Ukraine into renewed conflict. Biden in the phone call with Putin "emphasized the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity," according to a White House readout . Biden proposed holding a summit somewhere outside the U.S. and Russia "to discuss the full range of issues facing" the countries. The Kremlin later on Tuesday said in a statement that Biden had "suggested considering the possibility of holding a personal summit meeting in the foreseeable future." -- Natasha Turak contributed to this story from Dubai, and Amanda Macias contributed from Washington, D.C.

Paul Morina, the principal and head wrestling coach of Paulsboro, New Jersey, High School, is listed in financial records as the president of Hometown International, which owns a single delicatessen. Hometown International stock is trading at levels that give it a valuation of more than $100 million. The company's shop, Your Hometown Deli, did just $35,000 in sales — combined — over the past two years, a financial filing says.	He's a legend in New Jersey high school wrestling – and a mystery in the stock market. Paul Morina, the principal of Paulsboro, New Jersey, High School, is listed in financial records as the president, CEO, CFO and more at a Nevada-incorporated company whose stock is trading at levels that give it a valuation more than $100 million. That's an oddly high valuation because the company, Hometown International, owns a delicatessen — and only one small delicatessen — in Paulsboro, where the Morina-coached high school wrestling team frequently wins state championships. The company has disclosed that it has shareholders based in China's Macau territory. The shop, Your Hometown Deli, did just $35,000 in sales — combined — over the past two years, according to Hometown International's annual report, filed March 26 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Hedge fund manager David Einhorn mentioned Hometown International in a letter to clients Thursday, which warned about the risks to retail investors. "The pastrami must be amazing," Einhorn cracked of the company, whose stock from late March 2020 to early September rose to more than $9 per share from $3.25 per share despite the deli — its only operating business — being closed due to the coronavirus pandemic during that time frame. Hometown International's annual report shows that Morina, who is also the company's treasurer and a director, has 1.5 million shares of common shares in the company, with warrants for another 30 million shares. Morina owns 19% of Hometown's outstanding 7.79 million common shares. On Thursday, Hometown's stock, which trades thinly on the over-the-counter market, had a closing price of $13.50 per share. That makes Morina's common stock holdings alone worth $20.5 million — on paper, at least. FactSet data shows that Hometown rarely has more than a few hundred shares change hands per day, and often has days when no shares are exchanged. CNBC has reached out for comment to Morina, whose biography in the SEC filing says he has won 25 class state championships as a coach, with more than 550 victories. That biography does not say that Morina had prior experience in the food service industry. Nonetheless, Hometown International said in its filing, "We believe that Mr. Morina's in-depth knowledge and extensive experience makes him a valuable member of our board of directors." The filing says that Hometown International, which was incorporated in 2014, entered into a lease with Mantua Creek Group, of which Morina is a member, for its store space. Hometown's vice president and secretary is Christine Lindenmuth — a 46-year-old math teacher at Paulsboro High School, according to the SEC filing. Lindenmuth, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment, also does not appear to have any prior experience in food service. But Hometown International said it believes her "in-depth knowledge and extensive experience" also make her a valued company director. Lindenmuth holds no shares in the company, according to the SEC filing. The annual report says, "The Company presently has no full-time employees apart from its officers and directors, Paul F. Morina, President, and Christine T. Lindenmuth." It adds: "Both are currently working for the Company without any compensation." Hometown's annual report suggests that the company was formed with the idea of creating a chain of stores with "a new Delicatessen concept." "Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Your Hometown Deli Limited Liability Company ('Your Hometown Deli'), we operate a delicatessen store that features 'home-style' sandwiches and other entrees in a casual and friendly atmosphere," the filing says. "The store is designed to offer local patrons of all ages with a comfortable community gathering places. Targeted towards smaller towns and communities, the Company's first unit was built in Paulsboro, New Jersey." But that location, a low-slung, boxy building located just across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, remains the only store the company owns after about seven years in business. The company's chairman, according to the annual report, is Peter Coker Jr., who is listed as holding no Hometown International shares. Coker's bio in the company's annual report says the 1990 graduate of Lehigh University has been chairman of South Shore Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong-listed company, since 2013. It also says that Coker was the managing partner of Pacific Advisers, and was also a partner in a Shenzhen, China-based private equity firm called TDR Capital Investment Ltd. from 2009 to 2013. "From 2006 to 2009, Mr. Coker served as Chairman of Global Trading Offshore Pte (Singapore)," the filing says. "From 2002 to 2005, Mr. Coker served as the Chairman of Wellington Securities (New Zealand). Mr. Coker served as an officer of the Bridge Companies prior to joining Wellington Securities (New Zealand) in 2002." Coker's father, North Carolina resident Peter Coker Sr., is listed on the SEC filing as owning 63,334 shares of common stock in Hometown International, with warrants for 1.26 million more shares. CNBC has reached out for comment from both Cokers. Other owners of Hometown shares include Blackwell Partners LLC, Series A, which has an address in Hong Kong; and two other Hong Kong entities, Star V Partners LLC, and Maso Capital Investments Limited. Four other companies or entities listed as Hometown International share owners are based in Macau, China. One of the Macau companies, VCH Limited, in May 2020 entered into a consulting agreement with Hometown International, the filing said. "Pursuant to this agreement, VCH was engaged as a consultant to the Company, to, among other things, create and build a presence with high net worth and institutional investors," Hometown said in its annual report. "The term of the agreement is one year; provided, however , that each party has the right to terminate the agreement upon 30 days' prior written notice to the other," the report said. "Pursuant to the agreement, VCH shall receive $25,000 per month during the term of the agreement, in addition to reimbursement of expenses approved in advance by the Company." Hometown International booked a $624,438 loss for 2020, and a $153,930 loss for 2019, according to the firm's annual report. Much of the company's increases in costs in 2020 came from $320,000 in what it called "consulting fees." The elder Coker has been identified in other SEC-filed documents as is the founder and managing director of Tryon Capital Ventures, a North Carolina entity that has a consulting agreement with Hometown that pays Tryon $15,000 per month. "We anticipate extending the term of the Consulting Agreement with Tryon for an additional one-year term," the annual report says.
Teodoro Locsin Jr., Philippine secretary of foreign affairs, slammed China in a Twitter post as the two countries engage in a war of words over the South China Sea. Locsin asked China to "get the f--- out" and accused Beijing of straining its "friendship" with the Philippines. The Philippines and China have for years made overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea, a resource-rich waterway where trillions in dollars of global trade pass.	Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Teodoro Locsin Jr. slammed China with decidedly undiplomatic language on Twitter Monday, suggesting the Asian giant "get the f--- out" as the two countries engage in a war of words over the South China Sea. Locsin in the tweet accused China of straining its "friendship" with the Philippines. The foreign affairs secretary has been a vocal critic of China in the administration of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who sought closer ties with Beijing after taking office in 2016. China's embassy in the Philippine capital of Manila did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. In response to criticism of his rhetoric made by other Twitter users, Locsin said the " usual suave diplomatic speak gets nothing done ." The Philippines and China have for years contested overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea, a resource-rich waterway with a total area of about 1.4 million square miles where trillions in dollars of global trade pass. Beijing has in the past year appeared more assertive in the disputed waters. Locsin's Monday tweet followed a statement by the Philippine foreign affairs department , which protested the "illegal presence" of Chinese vessels in parts of the South China Sea that are internationally recognized as belonging to the Philippines. The statement lashed out at "belligerent actions" by the Chinese coast guard against their Philippine counterparts in the vicinity of Bajo de Masinloc. It said the Chinese had engaged in "shadowing, blocking, dangerous maneuver, and radio challenges" on April 24 to 25. It also protested the "incessant, illegal, prolonged, and increasing presence of Chinese finishing vessels and maritime militia vessels in Philippine maritime zones." Beijing last week maintained that it "enjoys sovereignty" over Bajo de Masinloc — which it calls Huangyan Island — and its surrounding waters. It urged the Philippines not to escalate disputes. Bajo de Masinloc, also known as Scarborough Shoal, is a chain of reefs in the South China Sea that lies around 120 nautical miles from the nearest Philippine coast and 470 nautical miles from the nearest coast of China. China claims most of the South China Sea, based on what it says are nine dashes that delineate Chinese territory in historic maps. An international tribunal in 2016 dismissed the so-called nine-dash line as legally baseless — a ruling ignored by Beijing.
China's coronavirus stimulus program ended three months earlier than the 12-month-long one in 2009 following the financial crisis, according to proprietary analysis released by Allianz on Monday. U.S. stimulus will likely increase demand for China's exports by $60 billion, according to senior economist Francoise Huang, citing estimates from Allianz's subsidiary Euler Hermes. "The aim of China's policy tightening is more about financial vulnerabilities and addressing the risk of overheating in the real estate and financial markets," Huang said.	BEIJING — China has recovered so rapidly from the coronavirus pandemic that authorities are pulling back support for the economy more quickly than they did following the 2008 financial crisis, according to Allianz. Back then, massive Chinese stimulus helped boost growth worldwide. This time, China's focus on tackling problems at home will not provide the same kind of global support, senior economist Francoise Huang said in a note Monday. Beijing's monetary easing policy, which includes lower interest rates, kicked off in January 2020 after an acceleration in the spread of Covid-19 domestically. The support reached its height nine months later in October, with only 41% of the intensity seen following the financial crisis, Huang said, citing proprietary analysis. That means China's coronavirus stimulus program ended three months earlier than the 12-month-long one in 2009, according to the research. China's economy grew 2.3% last year and was the only major country to expand amid a global recession. Stringent lockdown policies and restrictions on international travel allowed China to return to growth by the second quarter of last year with only pockets of new virus outbreaks. In contrast, the U.S. is still reporting tens of thousands of new cases a day, while the European Union is bracing for a third wave of the coronavirus. Stay-home measures and other restrictions on business activity have prompted governments in those regions to enact their own support measures. In particular, the U.S. under President Joe Biden launched a $1.9 trillion stimulus package this month. That has global implications, including for China's policymakers. U.S. "super stimulus" could increase China's exports to the U.S. this year and next by $60 billion, Huang said, citing estimates from Allianz's subsidiary Euler Hermes. That sort of demand for Chinese goods adds to the already resilient domestic economy, giving authorities more leeway to address local problems without being too concerned about hurting growth. "The aim of China's policy tightening is more about financial vulnerabilities and addressing the risk of overheating in the real estate and financial markets," Huang said. However, Huang does not expect rate hikes or high-profile measures "that could signal a policy cliff and jeopardize the economic recovery," but rather more subtle changes. In a sign of how Beijing is taking a moderate approach, the People's Bank of China on Monday kept the loan prime rate — a benchmark for lending costs — at the same level in March for an 11th-straight month. The last time the central bank changed the rate was a cut in April 2020.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday at a high-level press conference that the U.S. needs to remove "unreasonable restrictions" and stop interfering in what Beijing considers its domestic affairs. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has maintained a tough position on China and raised concerns about Beijing's stance around Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet. Wang did not specify what the restrictions were, and pointed to a phone call between the two countries' leaders in February as a positive basis for rebuilding the bilateral relationship.	BEIJING — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday that the U.S. needs to remove "unreasonable restrictions" for the two countries' relationship to move forward under President Joe Biden 's administration. Wang's remarks come as tensions between the U.S. and China have escalated in the last few years under former President Donald Trump, whose term ended in January. So far, the Biden administration has maintained a tough position on China — calling the country a more assertive "competitor " — and raised concerns about Beijing's stance around Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet. China's central government considers those issues part of its domestic matters. "Speaking of China-U.S. relations, I believe first of all both sides need to abide by the principle of non-interference in each others' internal affairs," Wang said. That's according to an official English translation of his Mandarin-language remarks at a press conference held alongside the "Two Sessions" annual parliamentary meeting in Beijing, the country's biggest political event of the year. Wang also called for the U.S. to "remove all its unreasonable restrictions on bilateral cooperation as early as possible" and "not create new obstacles." But he did not specify what the restrictions were. In a speech last month Wang had called for the new U.S. administration to remove tariffs and sanctions , particularly on China's technology companies. Citing national security concerns, Trump sanctioned dozens of Chinese companies , most prominently telecommunications giant Huawei. The company has suffered as a result, falling from the number one smartphone vendor globally to sixth place last year. On Sunday, Wang rejected claims that Beijing was committing "genocide" in Xinjiang and said the government had the ability to "thwart" all attempts to promote Taiwan's independence. He spoke firmly in support of Beijing's decision to "improve" Hong Kong's electoral system. Delegates at the Two Sessions are considering a proposal to change Hong Kong's electoral system , which would allow Beijing to strengthen its control of the semi-autonomous region. Biden had raised "fundamental concerns " about Beijing's actions on issues such as Hong Kong in a two-hour phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping in February ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, according to the White House. At the time, the two leaders also discussed how to counter the coronavirus pandemic, working together on climate change and preventing weapons proliferation. Wang said Sunday the two countries could also cooperate on the economic recovery from the pandemic, and pointed to the phone call as a positive basis for rebuilding the bilateral relationship. "We're ready to work with the United States to follow through on the outcome of this important phone call and set China-U.S. relations on a new path of healthy and steady growth," he said.
The coronavirus pandemic is accelerating the growth of e-commerce, including cross-border online sales between Chinese sellers and European buyers. The surge in online shopping has led to a shortage of warehouses in Europe and a record level of regional logistics investment in 2020, according to real estate consultancy Savills. China's cross-border e-commerce rose 31.1% last year, while overseas warehouses grew by 80%, according to official data.	BEIJING — Big investors are pouring money into warehouses in Europe as online shopping for goods — some all the way from China — takes off in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. E-commerce was already growing before the emergence of Covid-19 forced people to stay home and storefronts to close. Now, the pandemic has likely sped up the pace of e-commerce adoption by about 12 months , real estate consultancy Savills said in a December report citing the Centre for Retail Research. One of the biggest challenges for businesses wanting to take advantage of the trend is finding ways to fulfill orders more quickly. Companies that once relied on supply chains spread around the world face a shortage of shipping containers , resulting in high delivery costs and long wait times. The new strategy is finding warehouses near customers and stocking them ahead of time, so shoppers can get their orders in just a few days or less. That's caused a surge in warehouse demand, driving vacancy rates in Europe to a record low of around 5% — and the rate is still falling, said Marcus de Minckwitz, director of the omnichannel group in London for Savills. "Throughout the course of 2020 we saw record take-up of warehouse space in the continent, led by the U.K.," he said. "Drivers of that have been Amazon and then third-party logistics providers." Total investment in European logistics last year rose to 38.64 billion euros ($46.5 billion), the highest on record since 2013, according to Savills. Now, Europe awaits more demand from Chinese e-commerce players entering the market, led by Alibaba, de Minckwitz said. Alibaba has been expanding its cross-border e-commerce business, primarily through its AliExpress platform and Cainiao logistics arm. The company cited rapid growth in cross-border e-commerce as contributing to a 51% year-on-year surge in Cainiao's revenue to $1.74 billion in the last three months of 2020. Revenue from international commerce wholesale rose 53% to $577 million during that time, according to Alibaba. Some of the biggest firms in the investing world are taking note of the trend. Chinese authorities are also talking up the impact on trade. Cross-border e-commerce between China and other countries surged 31.1% last year to 1.69 trillion yuan, primarily in exports, according to the national customs agency. As a result, overseas warehouses rose 80% from a year ago to more than 1,800 in 2020, the Commerce Ministry said in January. Diane Wang, founder and chairperson of Chinese e-commerce site DHgate, said last month the company has 10 warehouses overseas and would like to add more in Europe, particularly in the U.K. and France. About half of products are pre-stored abroad so customers can receive their orders in about three days, she said. Wang expects cross-border e-commerce will grow from about 5% of China's international trade to 30% in the next decade. No official data by country or region was available, but anecdotes indicate much of the overseas interest in e-commerce with China comes from Europe . The region is already one of China's top trading partners. "A lot of people are buying the Chinese products in Europe," said Suresh Dalai, senior director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal, which focuses on retail operations in Asia. He expects more investment in technology for tracking orders, same-day delivery and storing packages in centralized lockers so consumers can pick up parcels at their convenience. "There is a lot of demand to go around. I don't think (new Chinese players) really impacts Alibaba that much," Dalai said. "I think it helps because it just spurs additional investment in warehouses and technology, and more and more consumers get used to shopping cross-border, and shopping on Chinese-created websites." Correction: This story was updated to reflect that DHgate would like to add more warehouses in Europe. A previous version mischaracterized the potential expansion.
BMW's all-electric iX3 SUV will cost 399,900 yuan ($61,713) to 439,900 yuan in China as of Thursday, the German automaker said on its website. That's down about $10,800 from the original price range of 470,000 yuan to 510,000 yuan announced in September. The new price brings BMW's China-made iX3 into a closer range with locally available electric cars from Tesla and Chinese start-ups.	BEIJING — German automaker BMW has cut prices for its all-electric iX3 SUV in China, bringing the car into closer competition with vehicles from Tesla and Chinese start-ups like Nio. BMW's website said as of Thursday, the recommended retail price for the iX3 will start at 399,900 yuan ($61,713). That's down 70,100 yuan — or about $10,800 and 15% cheaper — versus the original price of 470,000 yuan announced in September. "For its size the iX3 would be competing directly vs. the Tesla Model Y & NIO ES6 which both have starting prices substantially less than the iX3 prior to this cut, so BMW must've seen softness in the demand for the iX3 at that price point," said Tu Le, founder of Beijing-based advisory firm Sino Auto Insights. "Bottom line it wasn't competitive." BMW cut the price on a higher-end version of the iX3 by the same 70,100 yuan amount, for a new price of 439,900 yuan, down from 510,000 yuan. A representative for the company did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. The price drop follows Tesla's 30% cut to its China-made Model Y earlier this year to 339,900 yuan, down from 488,000 yuan, according to Chinese media reports. For comparison, Chinese electric car start-up Nio's ES6 sells for 358,000 yuan to 468,000 yuan. BMW manufactures the iX3 in China through a joint venture with Brilliance Auto. The China-made car is slated to be the first the joint venture will export to other countries, according to the German automaker. Global car companies are increasingly looking to China to launch their latest electric cars. The country is the world's largest auto market and the government has supported the electric vehicle market with subsidies and the rollout of battery charging infrastructure. Sales of new energy vehicles, which include both plug-in hybrid and pure electric cars, are expected to surge 40% this year to 1.8 million, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. New energy vehicle sales last year rose 10.9% to 1.367 million vehicles despite an overall drop in car sales and the coronavirus pandemic, the association said.
Wealthy nations have been accused of hoarding vaccines, mostly from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. It has created room for India, China, and to an extent Russia, to develop, produce and supply vaccines to the developing world. Experts say the efforts can bolster those countries' influence and deepen their ties with other nations.	SINGAPORE – With mass vaccination campaigns against Covid-19 underway globally, there is an emerging gap between rich and poor nations in their abilities to secure enough shots to immunize their people. Wealthy nations have been accused of hoarding vaccines , mostly from Pfizer - BioNTech and Moderna . That has created room for India, China, and to an extent Russia , to develop, produce and supply vaccines to the developing world. Experts say those efforts can potentially bolster those countries' influence and deepen their ties with other nations. "While it serves their foreign policy objectives, it serves their ... commercial interest to expand the market share of their vaccine products," Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNBC by phone. "In the meantime, it also helps mitigate the vast disparities in terms of the vaccine access between the wealthy nations and the poor nations," he added. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week that drugmakers prioritized regulatory approval in rich countries where the profits are highest, rather than submitting full dossiers to expedite a global vaccine distribution initiative supported by the WHO. "The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure – and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries," Tedros said . India has already sent 1 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to Nepal, 2 million to Bangladesh, 150,000 to Bhutan, 100,000 to Maldives and 1.5 million to Myanmar, per media reports. It has also sent 2 million doses to Brazil . India approved two vaccines for emergency use – one developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, which is being produced locally by the Serum Institute of India, and the other, named Covaxin, was developed domestically. Vaccine diplomacy can be an effective use of soft power that can help New Delhi win friends and generate goodwill, according to Akhil Bery, South Asia analyst at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. "India's generosity with its neighbors can help to mend ties, whether it be with Bangladesh (which was strained due to the Citizenship Amendment Act ), or with Sri Lanka, where the Rajapaksas are known to have a pro-China tilt," Bery told CNBC by email. The Rajapaksas are a prominent political family in Sri Lanka – both the country's president and prime minister are part of the family. "Even if the doses aren't that many, it's still significant enough to alleviate pressure on healthcare systems, allowing for resources to be allocated elsewhere," Bery added. With the virus mostly under control at home, China's strategy includes striking deals with emerging economies to conduct clinical trials for a vaccine developed by Chinese firm Sinovac and helping to build vaccine production facilities in some of those countries. Beijing is also giving priority access to its vaccines in places like Southeast Asia , which is of strategic importance to China. In other places, the country is offering loans to fund vaccine procurement . Eurasia Group's China researcher, Allison Sherlock, told CNBC that the benefits for China are limited to reinforcing economic and political ties in its existing sphere of influence in regions including Southeast Asia. There, Beijing "is especially hoping that the vaccine will help repair relationships strained by tensions over the South China Sea, including with Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam." "India wants to burnish its credentials as a responsible global stakeholder while China would like to improve its reputation which got tarnished in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic," said Harsh Pant, head of the strategic studies program at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. "Both would be hoping that their outreach would give them some political goodwill and influence as well," he told CNBC by email. The coronavirus was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in 2019 and Beijing has faced criticism over its early handling of the pandemic. Given the nature of Sino-Indian ties, experts said it was inevitable that New Delhi and Beijing's efforts in providing vaccines to other countries would be viewed through a competitive lens. Both India and China have downplayed the notion of vaccine diplomacy, describing the jabs as a necessary public good to tackle the global pandemic. India, which kicked off its domestic immunization campaign this month, is not producing or using Covid vaccines as a kind of diplomacy, former Indian ambassador Rajiv Bhatia told CNBC. "It is very much first a national effort," he said. "Vaccines are primarily to help the country's people but India has not forgotten its global responsibility," Bhatia said. He explained that India's efforts would help enhance the international prestige of the country's scientists and products. The shots "will have positive impact beyond insulating people from this disease. It will add to the national pride and confidence." Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Monday responded to questions about India's plans to send vaccines to its neighbors and said, "This issue can afford no place for malign competition, let alone the so-called 'rivalry'. We hope and welcome that more doses of safe and effective vaccines will be manufactured at a faster pace by more countries." Beijing has stepped up domestic efforts to immunize key groups of people ahead of the Lunar New Year next month, when many are expected to travel around the country. Reuters reported that China approved three vaccines for emergency use but only one for the general public, while a fourth is being used by the military. CFR's Huang said he sensed a shift in China's strategy in which Beijing is starting to prioritize domestic needs more, but is still following through on promises. He explained that China is likely to rely more on countries that have signed partnership agreements to produce its vaccines and use that to support other nations. China may also "provide financial assistance so that (other countries) can buy the vaccines from other sources," Huang added. One of the challenges vaccines developed locally in India and China face is their effectiveness in combating the disease. India's Covaxin is still undergoing clinical trials. At the time it received emergency approval from the drug regulator, it did not have extensive phase three trial data to determine its efficacy or safety. The rushed move was criticized by scientists . Sinovac's CoronaVac was found to be only 50.4% effective in clinical trials carried out in Brazil but has yielded different results elsewhere, raising concern and criticism over data transparency. "An argument can be made if you have a vaccine whose efficacy rate is as low as 50%, you need more people to get vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity," CFR's Huang said. He added that India and China, both of which have large populations, will have to grapple with fulfilling domestic needs while maintaining international obligations and demand. "That is going to further complicate issue in their efforts to play a leadership role by reducing the vaccine access gap," he said. Eurasia Group's Bery said that one advantage India has is that the Serum Institute is one of the world's largest vaccine manufacturers and that the country supplies more than 50% of the world's vaccines. "It will take time, but as we've seen from South Africa and Brazil, countries are lining up to gain access to vaccines manufactured in India," he said. Bery explained, however, China has its own distinct advantage – unlike its South Asian rival, it has brought the pandemic under control much quicker, thus the Chinese economy has recovered faster. "This allowed it to increase international policy actions, while other countries, such as India, remained distracted by the pandemic," Bery said.
By 2030, China's private consumption is set to more than double to reach $12.7 trillion, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report released Wednesday. Spurring this expected growth are: greater government emphasis on policies to support the domestic Chinese economy, increases in household income, further growth of urban areas, changes in technology and demographic shifts, the report said. However, uncertainties such as the rollout of government policy may limit how much Chinese actually spend in coming years.	BEIJING — Chinese consumer spending is set to more than double in 10 years, with an emphasis on services rather than goods, Morgan Stanley analysts predicted in a roughly 200-page report released Wednesday. By 2030, China's private consumption is set to reach $12.7 trillion, about the same amount that American consumers currently spend, the report said. That figure is also up from Morgan Stanley's forecast three years ago of $9.7 trillion, and the $5.6 trillion Chinese consumers spent in 2019. Spurring this expected growth are: greater government emphasis on policies to support the domestic Chinese economy, increases in household income, further growth of urban areas, changes in technology and demographic shifts, the report said. The analysts predict disposable income per capita will likely double from $6,000 a year to $12,000 in 2030 as more people grow older and leave the work force. Significantly, the Morgan Stanley analysts expect future Chinese spending will go into new categories of growth over the next 10 years as the age groups with the most purchasing power have families or retire. "Material shifts in consumption patterns are likely to take place, from young consumer focused to household demand driven, which will incrementally require a higher proportion of services in consumption," the report said. The 35 to 45 age category will likely increase by 25.3 million people, or about the current size of Australia, and those age 55 and above is set to increase by 123.9 million, or about the current population of Japan, the report said. The analysts added the size of other adult age categories will likely decline as a result of China's years-long ban on having more than one child and an overall drop in birth rates. "We think the average Chinese consumer will be a driver of change rather than merely a recipient of Western consumption trends," the authors added. "Part of that change will be informed by certain cultural values and consumption needs to support those values. These include strong family ties and the prioritization of education." Morgan Stanley's prediction of $7 trillion more in spending over the next several years means Chinese private consumption will likely grow by about 7.9% a year in the next decade, “one of the highest levels in the world," the report said. But uncertainties remain as the global economy struggles to handle the coronavirus pandemic. While China's economy overall recovered quickly from the initial shock of the pandemic, personal spending took longer to bounce back. Retail sales contracted by 3.9% last year despite a 2.3% increase in national GDP. On a monthly basis, sales returned to growth in August and grew 4.6% in December from a year ago. The Morgan Stanley analysts listed several other developments that could prevent Chinese from spending as much as they predict. Authorities could aggressively tighten the availability of credit for consumers, the report said. Chinese might also be inclined to save more if increased automation and other technological applications result in larger-than-expected job losses, or if the government isn't able to significantly improve social security plans to help cover large personal costs. Chinese households mainly save for education, retirement, and healthcare, the report said.
The latest GDP reports show that of the U.S. fell by 2.3% in 2020, while China's grew by 2.3% amid the coronavirus pandemic. The divergence means China will likely overtake the U.S. as the world's largest economy a few years earlier than anticipated, economists said. However, they pointed out the two countries have different economic structures, and China's per capita GDP is still far below that of the U.S.	BEIJING — China is set to overtake the United States as the world's largest economy a few years earlier than anticipated due to the coronavirus pandemic, analysts said. The U.S. reported last week that gross domestic product in 2020 contracted by 2.3% to $20.93 trillion in current-dollar terms, based on a preliminary government estimate . In contrast, China said its GDP expanded by 2.3% last year to 101.6 trillion yuan. That's about $14.7 trillion, based on an average exchange rate of 6.9 yuan per U.S. dollar, according to Wind Information data. That puts China's economy at only $6.2 trillion behind the U.S., down from $7.1 trillion in 2019. "This (divergence in growth) is consistent with our view that the pandemic has been a much larger blow to the US economy than China's economy," Rob Subbaraman of Nomura said in an email Friday. "We believe that on reasonable growth projections the size of China's economy in USD terms will overtake the US in 2028." If the Chinese currency strengthens further to around 6 yuan per U.S. dollar, China could surpass the U.S. two years earlier than anticipated — in 2026, Subbaraman said. The yuan began strengthening against the U.S. dollar in the last six months to levels not seen in more than two years. Covid-19 first emerged in late 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. In an effort to control the virus, authorities shut down more than half of China's economy in February 2020 and urban unemployment hit a record high of 6.2% that month. GDP contracted by 6.8% in the first quarter. The outbreak stalled domestically after several weeks, and the economy returned to growth in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the coronavirus spread widely overseas and became a global pandemic, hitting the U.S. the worst. The U.S. has the most number of Covid-19 deaths and infections in the world. The U.S. unemployment rate surged above 14% in April and remained above 10% for three more months. "The latest GDP data shows that China's recovery enjoyed strong momentum towards the end of 2020, due to its ability to contain the pandemic," Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in an email Friday. He expects it will take another eight to 10 years for China's GDP to catch up to that of the U.S. He said new government restrictions following pockets of coronavirus cases in China in the last several weeks will likely give mixed signals on first quarter growth, while the U.S. will benefit from government support passed late last year. But Tai added that GDP is "just a convenient comparison" and that when making decisions, investors should also consider differences in economic structure, income, development and competitive edge. For economists concerned about the sustainability of long-term growth, much of China's recovery last year came from traditional industries such as manufacturing, rather than increased domestic consumption. As overseas demand for face masks and other medical protective gear soared, China's exports rose 3.6% in U.S. dollar-terms in 2020, while imports fell by 1.1% in the same period. China's closely watched trade surplus with the U.S. rose to $317 billion in 2020, up from $296 billion a year earlier, even though the two countries signed a trade agreement in January last year in an effort to reduce that surplus. On the other hand, China's domestic consumption didn't recover as quickly as the rest of the economy. Retail sales fell 3.9% in 2020, while those in the U.S. rose by 0.6%. Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance, expects the coronavirus will allow China to overtake the U.S. three to five years earlier than previously expected. But he said the "real milestone" will be when China can overtake the U.S. in terms of GDP per capita. With about four times the number of people as the U.S., China's per capita GDP rose to around $11,000 in 2020, while that of the U.S. was more than five times greater at $63,200.
Last month, the U.S. designated Xiaomi as one of several "Communist Chinese military companies" under the National Defense Authorization Act of 1999. Xiaomi is now subject to a November executive restricting American investors from buying shares or related securities of any companies that have the Chinese military designation. Xiaomi has sued the U.S. treasury and defense departments to get the the designation as a military company removed.	GUANGZHOU, China — Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has sued the U.S., seeking to to be removed from Washington's blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies, which prevents American investors from buying shares in Xiaomi. Last month, the U.S. designated Xiaomi as one of several "Communist Chinese military companies" under the National Defense Authorization Act of 1999. That designation means Xiaomi will be subjected to a November executive order by former president Donald Trump, which restricts American investors from buying shares or related securities of any companies that have the Chinese military designation. In response, Xiaomi filed a lawsuit on Friday against the U.S. treasury and defense departments in the district court of Columbia, according to its investor relations website on Sunday. Xiaomi alleged that the Chinese military designation is "unconstitutional because it deprives Xiaomi of its liberty and property rights without due process of law" and therefore violates the Fifth Amendment of the U.S Constitution. The Chinese company also said the ban on investors buying shares will cause "irreparable harm." "By cutting off Xiaomi from U.S. capital markets, the Designation and related restrictions will damage the company's ability to conduct, grow and finance its business, sell its products, maintain and grow its business relationships, and recruit and retain employees," the company's lawsuit said. Xiaomi shares were up 1.2% in Hong Kong trade at 11:46am HK /SIN time. The company also said that it is "not owned or controlled by, or otherwise affiliated with the Chinese government or military, or owned or controlled by any entity affiliated with the Chinese defense industrial base." Xiaomi said any Chinese government or military entity doesn't posses the ability "to exert control over the management or affairs of the company." Huawei, which was a target under the Trump administration, has also tried to use the U.S. legal system to overturn actions taken by Washington. In March 2019, Huawei sued the U.S. over a law that banned government agencies from buying the Chinese technology giant's equipment. That lawsuit was rejected by a federal judge last year.
Relations with Russia, which Germany relies on heavily for energy, have recently touched another low. With China, it's becoming increasingly clear that there will be no "political change" through trade.	FRANKFURT — Putting trade and business interests first has always been the German government's mantra when it comes to the country's relationship with China and Russia. With "Wandel durch handel," which translates as "change through trade" in the case of China, German officials have effectively been trying to use its economic ties to push Beijing into making progressive reforms. With Russia there has been the "Modernisierungspartnerschaft," which means "partnership for modernization." But both have more or less failed. Relations with Russia, which Germany relies on heavily for energy, have recently touched another low after the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who flew to Berlin for treatment against the will of the Kremlin. "It is impossible given these developments to go back to the old policy approach which basically entailed a lot of understanding for Russia," Daniela Schwarzer, director of the German Council on Foreign Relations, told CNBC in a phone interview. With China, it's becoming increasingly clear that there will be no "political change" through trade. But many say it's high time for Germany to be stricter with Beijing, be it on acquisitions, technology or human rights issues. "There is a great deal of pressure to be stricter with China," Noah Barkin, a managing editor with the research firm the Rhodium Group, told CNBC in a phone interview. "Under Merkel, Germany did not really have red lines. That needs to change. Europe needs to develop stricter boundaries with China." China is both a rival and a partner for Germany in many respects. Companies in the European powerhouse rely on its huge consumer market to sell their products. The main problem with China is that there isn't a level playing field for foreign firms, as it keeps its market tightly regulated, if not closed, for outsiders. "That's a huge challenge for the new German government," Schwarzer explained. "The new government needs to raise awareness of the threat posed by the competitor China." Chancellor Angela Merkel has gained a lot of trust around the globe from other leaders as she is seen as a reliable partner with heaps of experience on the political stage. While she's had patience with Beijing, recent policy actions have shown she's already initiated a change in tone: Last year a foreign trade law was toughened to make the acquisition of German companies more difficult. Meanwhile, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said in June that lawmakers needed to assure "our German and European companies are protected from unfair competition and illegal technology transfer and from acquisition by state-subsidized competitors which are often from countries outside the EU." Merkel and what will be her last government — elections are due in September — are moving toward a tougher line and any new legislature in Germany will likely follow that path. "There is a great deal of pressure for change from lawmakers in the Bundestag (German Parliament) but also from outside," explained Barkin. "German allies like India, Japan, Canada are all hiking the pressure on Germany, it will be much more difficult for Germany just to sit on the fence in the future." But it's unlikely they'll be a dramatic shift any time soon, as economic dependencies on China are large and there is still a wish in Berlin to maintain some sort of constructive dialogue.
Taiwan's economy grew 2.98% in 2020 compared to a year ago, advance estimates by the island's statistics office showed on Friday — the growth outpaced China's 2.3% expansion. The last time Taiwan's economy grew faster than China was in 1990, when the island's 5.5% growth beat its giant neighbor's 3.9%, official data from both sides showed. Strong exports from Taiwan — particularly of semiconductors — helped to offset drags from the Covid-19 pandemic, said Angela Hsieh, an economist at British bank Barclays.	SINGAPORE — Taiwan unexpectedly became Asia's top-performing economy last year — and outgrew China for the first time in 30 years. It came as strong global demand for the island's tech exports outweighed the hit from the Covid-19 pandemic. The Taiwanese economy grew 2.98% in 2020 compared to a year ago, advance estimates by the island's statistics office showed on Friday. It beat the 2.58% forecast by its central bank and  edged out Vietnam's 2.9% growth. Some economists had predicted Vietnam would be Asia's fastest-growing economy in 2020. Taiwan's expansion last year was also higher than China's 2.3% full year growth in 2020 . The island last outgrew its giant neighbor in 1990, when its 5.5% growth beat China's 3.9%, official data from both sides showed. "2020 has been a record year for Taiwan, and we expect the star to continue shining," Angela Hsieh, an economist at British bank Barclays, wrote in a Friday report after Taiwan released the numbers. The island's strength in exports in the second half of last year — particularly of semiconductors — helped the economy to "easily offset" any drags from the pandemic, said Hsieh. The economist raised her forecast for Taiwan's 2021 growth by 1.2 percentage points to 5.2% — much higher than official projection of 3.83%. Taiwan has also had relative success in containing the spread of Covid-19, allowing its economy to avoid a strict lockdown experienced by others globally. As of Sunday, the island reported 911 confirmed infections and eight deaths, according to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. Taiwan is a powerhouse in the production of semiconductors, which are important components powering products from cars, to computers and mobile phones. Demand for chips surged globally when the pandemic forced people to spend more time indoors, as the lockdowns triggered an uptick in sales of consumer electronics such as laptops. More recently, a global shortage of semiconductors led several automakers — including American carmaker Ford Motor and Japan's Nissan Motor — to cut production at some of their plants . Economists at research firm TS Lombard estimated that Taiwan and South Korea account for 83% of global processor chip production and 70% of memory chip output — which means the two East Asian economies have a near-monopoly status in both segments of the industry. That dominance would allow Taiwan and South Korea to "leverage their increased strategic importance for economic and political gains" from the U.S. and China — their two largest customers, the economists said in a Friday note. "Taiwan and Korea are on the front line of the US-China confrontation, reliant on China for growth, but on the US as guarantor of national security," they said. For Taiwan, such "wins" have included weapons sales from the U.S. and the lack of economic pressure from China, said TS Lombard economists. The Chinese Communist Party in Beijing claims Taiwan — a democratic and self-ruled island — as a runaway province that must be reunited with the mainland. The CCP has never ruled Taiwan. In the near term, China could become more reliant on Taiwan for semiconductors as it cuts out U.S. suppliers, according to TS Lombard. Beijing aims to become self-reliant over the long term as tensions with the U.S. grow, but some analysts said China's ability to do so are still far behind . "Cutting out US suppliers further increases PRC reliance on Taiwan and Korea," wrote TS Lombard economists. "Such is the Mainland dependence on Taiwan, that Beijing is unwilling to apply economic pressure to the island, instead China has adopted 'grey zone' warfare tactics, and even talk of military action, all while continuing to purchase TSMC products," they added, referring to the world's largest semiconductor foundry in Taiwan. TSMC's shares in Taiwan jumped 60% last year when the coronavirus spread globally. The shares have continued to climb this year, rising by 11.5% in January from last year's close. It's a matter of time before mainland Chinese companies catch up to Taiwanese capabilities in producing high-tech electronic parts such as semiconductors, said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at Dutch bank ING. "A few years from now, when Mainland China starts to achieve self-reliance in advance technology, not only will it not buy as much from Taiwan as before, it will also become Taiwan's main competitor in the global market," she wrote in a Friday report. Until then, Taiwan's growth — powered by the "lone growth engine" of electronics exports — will likely continue into 2021, added Pang. She explained that demand could come from automakers, as well as consumers upgrading their smartphones and computer equipment. "All this suggests the market prospects for Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturers are bright this year," said the economist. "So even if Taiwan arguably depends too much on the electronics sector for economic growth, job opportunities and investment, this is less of a problem given that other economies cannot compete on capacity and technology."
Morgan Stanley predicts double-digit gains for China's electric car stocks given strong growth as the industry moves rapidly toward tech upgrades. "The NEV (new energy vehicles) market is attaching greater importance to tech software and hardware features in 2021," Morgan Stanley said in a report dated Jan. 28	Watch out, Tesla . Morgan Stanley is expecting double-digit gains for China's electric car stocks given strong predicted growth as the industry moves rapidly toward tech upgrades. "China's EV (electric vehicle) competition will be more of a tech battle in 2021," the analysts said. For the market of new energy passenger cars the analysts raised their forecast by about 200,000 vehicles to 1.7 million in sales in China this year, about 41% growth from a year ago. NEVs, or new energy vehicles, include plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles. "The NEV market is attaching greater importance to tech software and hardware features in 2021," Morgan Stanley said in a report dated Jan. 28.
Chinese electric carmaker Nio said it delivered 7,225 vehicles in January, more than four times the number of cars delivered during the same month last year. Its rival Xpeng said it delivered 6,015 electric cars in January, a third-straight record month of deliveries.	BEIJING — Chinese electric car start-up Nio is off to a solid start for the year, even if it has a long way to go to catch up with market leader Tesla . The company said Monday it delivered 7,225 vehicles in January, more than four times the 1,598 cars delivered during the same month last year. Last month's figures also mark Nio's sixth-straight month of record high deliveries, bringing the start-up's cumulative deliveries to 82,866. It's taken Nio about six years to reach this point, while Tesla delivered 180,570 cars in the last three months of 2020 alone. Nio's New York-listed shares have climbed 17% for the year so far, just shy of Tesla's 19% gain. Both stocks are outperforming the S&P 500's roughly half-percent rise. Shares of Xpeng , another U.S.-listed Chinese electric car company, are up 15% for the year so far. Xpeng said Monday it delivered 6,015 electric cars in January, a third-straight record month of deliveries. The company's P7 sedan accounted for more than half of last month's deliveries for a total of 18,772 since its mass rollout began in late June.
Morgan Stanley analysts predict consumption in China will double in the next decade to $12.7 trillion. Analysts said in a report released Wednesday they expect "robust growth" in categories such as education and health care, smart appliances and electric vehicles. Experience-related sectors such as pets and toys, service robots and social media will also likely see significant growth, the report said.	Chinese consumption is expected to double in the next decade — and Morgan Stanley has some investing ideas for the trend. Government policy and an aging population will likely help boost consumption to $12.7 trillion by 2030, more than two times the $5.6 trillion spent in 2019, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report released Wednesday. On a per capita basis, disposable incomes are set to double from $6,000 a year to $12,000 in 2030, the report said. The rapid rise of e-commerce and one-hour delivery have already spurred the growth of Chinese corporate giants such as Alibaba and JD.com . As the Chinese population ages and new technology emerges, other companies will likely get a boost.
Nasdaq-listed Li Auto delivered 5,379 Li One SUVs in January, down from December's 6,126 figure but a four-fold increase from last year. Chinese electric car start-ups Nio and Xpeng both delivered more cars than Li Auto last month. Competition increased in January with Tesla announcing its China-made Model Y would soon begin deliveries at a price close to SUVs from Nio and Li Auto.	BEIJING — As 2021 kicks off, a slide in January deliveries puts Chinese automaker Li Auto in third place behind its start-up competitors Nio and Xpeng . Nasdaq-listed Li Auto said late Monday, Eastern Time, it delivered 5,379 Li One SUVs in January. That's down from 6,126 in December and below Nio's 7,225 and Xpeng's 6,015 deliveries for January. Li Auto also announced it is setting up a new research and development center in Shanghai for autonomous driving and other electric vehicle-related technologies. Shares of Li Auto fell the most among its peers in U.S. trading Tuesday, down 5.7% versus losses of about 4.6% for Xpeng and 2.1% for Nio. Tesla shares rose 3.9%. Competition for high-end electric SUVs increased in January with Tesla announcing it would soon begin deliveries of its China-made Model Y at a price close to that of cars from Nio and Li Auto. Tesla delivered 180,570 electric cars worldwide in the last three months of 2020 alone. The Li One SUV is Li Auto's first and only model so far . It was the best-selling high-end electric SUV in 2020 and even made it into the top 10 list for high-end SUVs overall, along with Nio, according to China's Passenger Car Association. Morgan Stanley analysts said the Li One SUV stands out for its fuel tank that can charge the battery and extend the driving range by 620 kilometers (385 miles) to a total of 800 kilometers. One of Chinese consumers' biggest concerns about buying an electric car is whether it will run out of battery power too quickly, with no charging station nearby or long charging times. January's deliveries of 5,379 Li One SUVs still marked a four-fold increase from the same period a year ago, and cumulative deliveries have surpassed 38,900 since the vehicle's launch in December 2019, according to Li Auto. That's less than half of the over 82,800 vehicles Nio said it had cumulatively delivered as of the end of January . Nio has three SUV models on the market, and plans to begin deliveries of a sedan next year.
U.S. sanctions on Myanmar could open the door to increased Chinese influence in the Southeast Asian country, said an analyst from geopolitical consultancy Stratfor. Myanmar's military, citing election fraud, seized power this week after detaining several elected officials including de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and declaring a one-year state of emergency. U.S. sanctions could hit Washington's Asian partners which have helped to counter China's "stranglehold" on Myanmar, said Rodger Baker, senior vice president for strategic analysis at Stratfor.	SINGAPORE — U.S. sanctions on Myanmar following this week's military coup could open the door for China to extend its influence in the Southeast Asian country, said an analyst from geopolitical consultancy Stratfor. President Joe Biden has threatened sanctions and condemned the military takeover that occurred on Monday. Citing election fraud, Myanmar's military detained several elected officials including de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and declared a one-year state of emergency. While the U.S. doesn't have a large economic interest in Myanmar, its Asian partners such as Japan, South Korea and India have expanded business and military presence there, said Rodger Baker, senior vice president for strategic analysis at Stratfor. The presence of those Asian countries in Myanmar has helped to counter China's "economic stranglehold" on the Southeast Asian country, Baker told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Wednesday. "If the U.S. puts sanctions, this potentially has an impact on the U.S. partnership structure in countering Chinese behavior within the region," he said. Baker's comments came after Japan issued similar warnings. Japan's State Minister of Defence Yasuhide Nakayama warned in an interview with Reuters Tuesday that the democratic countries — including the U.S., U.K. and Japan — risk pushing Myanmar closer to China if their response to the coup shuts off communication channels with the country's military. There's been increasing calls within Washington for the Biden administration to take tough actions against the military. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday said the U.S. should pursue the strongest possible sanctions, including acting via the United Nations "to see if the Russians and Chinese would actually veto it," reported Reuters. China, which shares a border with Myanmar, is a major investor and trading partner of its southern neighbor. Beijing's response to the coup has been muted. Repeating his statement from a day ago, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Tuesday said "we have noted what happened in Myanmar." But he added that "whatever actions taken by the international community shall contribute to Myanmar's political and social stability, promote its peace and reconciliation, and avoid escalating the conflict and complicating the situation," according to a transcript posted on the ministry's website. Baker said Beijing has a track record of playing multiple sides in countries — sometimes simultaneously. In Myanmar, China has allegedly supported rebel groups against the military, but has also backed the military against the rebels, added Baker. For China, "it's just interests, how do they get access and they're gonna continue to say they don't care who runs it (Myanmar)," he said. The unfolding crisis in Myanmar presents an early foreign policy test for Biden in a region where China's influence has been expanding. U.S.-China tensions escalated during former President Donald Trump's term, and remain one of the biggest policy challenges that Biden has inherited. Competition between the two countries "will shape Washington's response to Myanmar's coup," said a Stratfor report published on Monday. That means any action against Myanmar by the U.S. under Biden would be "very selective" — so that "it doesn't necessarily hit hard against Indian interests, or against Japanese interests, (South) Korean interests," Baker told CNBC.
Jack Ma, Alibaba's high-profile founder appears to be on the wrong side of the Chinese government. His negative comments about financial regulators were met by a chain of events that includes the cancellation of the Ant Group IPO and an anti-monopoly probe into Alibaba. Some analysts and experts are concerned that these factors could weigh on the growth of Alibaba. One investor told CNBC that the current concerns are just "noise" for long-term Alibaba holders.	GUANGZHOU, China — Jack Ma , Alibaba's high-profile founder appears to be on the wrong side of the Chinese government, after comments he made were met by tightened regulatory scrutiny on the e-commerce giant. Even after Alibaba reported December-quarter earnings above expectations , analysts and experts have warned that Ma's friction with Beijing could hurt growth. "Investors are looking at Alibaba with a much more careful eye after having been attracted by the growth story and the founder's global profile," Rebecca Fannin, author of "Tech Titans of China," told CNBC by email. "The current frictions are a new reality for investors who may not have carefully considered how the company's rise as a powerful tech titan could be a threat to the status quo." It began in October when Ma made some negative comments about Chinese financial regulators just days ahead of the initial public offering (IPO) of Ant Group in Shanghai and Hong Kong , which would have been the world's biggest. Ma also founded Ant Group and Alibaba owns about a third of the company. Regulators effectively pulled the plug on the IPO two days before it was set to take place. Ant cited "significant issues such as the changes in financial technology regulatory environment" for the cancellation. But the episode has pushed regulators to hone in on Alibaba's broader business. In December, China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) opened an investigation into Alibaba over monopolistic practices . Ant Group is working on a "rectification plan" while Alibaba said it will cooperate with regulators on the anti-monopoly probe. This chain of events has also increased the tension between Beijing and Ma. He had been laying low since his comments in October but briefly reappeared in a video for his charitable foundation in January . On Tuesday, however, Reuters reported Ma was left off a list of Chinese entreprenuerial leaders published by state media, in a further snub to the billionaire. There are two major concerns now. First, that Ant Group could be forced to restructure and even scale back some of its businesses like lending which has driven its growth. Such moves could seriously slash its valuation . The second concern is whether regulators might force Alibaba to break up or change parts of it core commerce business, which is its biggest profit driver. "For now the greatest risk seems to be around investors' confidence in the Alibaba brand and ecosystem," Neil Campling, head of tech, media and telecom research at Mirabaud Securities, told CNBC by email. "But if there is tighter regulation for the core drivers of the Alibaba platform then it could certainly stunt the growth of Alibaba. After all innovation and intricate weaving of the different aspects of the ecosystem combine to bring economies of scale and growth." Campling has a long-term buy rating on Alibaba's stock. Fannin believes Ma's friction with Beijing will "ease up" but it will take some "agility on Alibaba's part to deal with government pressure, changing consumer needs in a digital economy, and investor concerns." Alibaba's U.S.-listed stock has been under pressure since the Ant Group IPO was pulled, falling from a record closing high of $317.14 on Oct. 27 to $254.50 at the close on Tuesday, a nearly 20% drop. But some analysts and investors remain bullish. Mizuho increased its price target on the stock from $270 to $285 on Tuesday saying the "stock (is attractive with the regulatory overhang mostly priced in." Matthew Schopfer, head of research at Infusive, an asset manager which is invested in Alibaba, said that the recent concern around the tech giant "will prove to be noise for the long-term investor." "Alibaba is a leading example of China's technological capabilities and we do not expect the government to permanently damage the business. Additionally, heightened regulation will only further entrench the scale players like Alibaba," Schopfer told CNBC by email. "When we get to the other side of these regulatory headwinds, we think the market will again focus on Alibaba and its platforms as a critical part of the Chinese consumer's everyday life and a major beneficiary from growth in Chinese spending power and the increasing digitalization of consumption."
China said the number of internet users in the country rose to 989 million by the end of last year, with more than 80 million going online in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Only about 30% of those nearly 1 billion users made the equivalent of $774 or more a month, the report said. Fewer Chinese used online education and health-care services by December compared with earlier in the year, the report said.	BEIJING — New data show the extent to which Chinese people went online in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and adopted new habits, such as shopping through video livestreams. By the end of 2020, China had 989 million internet users, according to figures released Wednesday by government agency China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC). That's up by 85.4 million from March, just after the worst of the coronavirus outbreak in China that forced hundreds of millions of Chinese people to spend more time indoors. For a sense of the scale of China's nearly 1 billion-large internet population, its lead over India's estimated 639 million internet users is 350 million, which is bigger than the entire U.S. population. The government report also showed how, after the worst of the outbreak in China was over by April, some online trends stuck, while others didn't. The report said that between March and the end of the year 72.15 million more people were shopping online, predominantly on mobile phones, reaching 782 million. More people also had more money to spend — and were increasingly working from home. The report said the proportion of internet users with a monthly income of at least 5,001 yuan ($774) rose to 29.3% in December, up from 27.6% in March. The number of people working remotely climbed by 147 million from June to 346 million as of December — about a third of the country's internet users. As significant the growth was in online shoppers, video watching jumped even more — by 76.33 million over nine months — to 927 million in December. That means nearly 94% of all Chinese internet users watched online videos, far more than the 79% who shopped online. Short video users alone climbed by 100 million from March to 873 million at the end of the year. Livestreaming e-commerce users also surged, up by 123 million from March to 388 million in December. About two-thirds of these users have made a purchase while watching a livestream, the report said. While learning and getting health consultations online saw significant growth during the coronavirus outbreak, usage dropped by December. Online education users stood at 342 million, down by 81.25 million from March's 423 million total. Online health-care users fell to 215 million, down from the 276 million the agency had reported for June. March figures were not available. Wednesday's report did note that online health care's penetration in less developed parts of China increased from June to about one-fifth in December.
Short selling refers to a trading strategy that allows investors to bet that the price of a stock or security will fall. In the last two weeks, members of the WallStreetBets online forum encouraged the bidding up of shares that hedge funds have shorted, resulting in a surge in some stock prices and losses for those funds. Analysts say its unlikely something similar would happen in mainland China given tight regulation and online censorship.	BEIJING —  The recent short selling frenzy on Wall Street will not likely come to China, where there are many more market restrictions. Short selling refers to a trading strategy that allows investors to bet that the price of a stock or security will fall. To short a stock, investors borrow shares and sell them, then ideally buy them back at a lower price later, and pocket the profits made. If the share price does not drop, the short seller will try to minimize losses by buying back the stock, which now costs more. Investors in mainland China have a limited ability to short stocks — a sign that the  local markets are still immature . Tight regulation and online censorship in China also contribute to different investor behavior versus that of the U.S. Since last month, millions of individual investors  have piled into the WallStreetBets forum on Reddit, encouraging one another to bid up shares of stocks that hedge funds have shorted, or bet would fall in price. A rush of trades through stock brokers like the free Robinhood app caused shares of heavily shorted stocks like GameStop , a video game retailer, to surge 400% in a week. Shares of GameStop and others that were targeted by the Reddit community have since fallen drastically — but not before some funds betting against them lost billions of dollars. Here's why analysts say something similar won't likely happen in China: First, the concept of short selling is relatively new and limited in scope in the country, where authorities are on high alert for controlling risks. Regulators only started to allow short selling about 10 years ago and it remains well below 1% of the total market value. The process is essentially the same as the U.S. Traders profit by borrowing shares, selling them and then buying them back after prices drop. But one difference in China is that regulators only allow investors to short a portion of stocks traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. The list of stocks — roughly 1,600 or more of them — changes regularly and typically only includes companies with good fundamentals, according to Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance. That contrasts with the short selling environment in the U.S., where dedicated funds typically pick companies like GameStop for perceived weaknesses in their businesses. Limited ability to short Chinese stocks and caps of 10% or 20% on daily price moves gives speculators more incentive to pursue different money-making strategies, such as driving prices up before selling. In the U.S., trading of individual stocks might be paused for excessive volatility, but prices can ultimately soar or plunge – like GameStop's surge of more than 130% one day and a 44% plunge the next. Chinese regulators prioritize stability when forming economic and financial policies — even if they would like to improve the business environment by attracting more foreign investors and increasing the role of stock markets in financing Chinese companies. That mentality has affected local stock investors, who tend to assume implicit government support means Chinese stocks will only rise. Local interpretation of official signals have also spurred bouts of speculation in the mainland stock market, causing many to nickname it a "casino." But with millions of ordinary individuals, rather than institutions, dominating Chinese stock trading, regulators are keen to prevent widespread losses as a way of ensuring stability. That means authorities will take extra precautions to control markets, and it would be very difficult for a large group of retail investors to incite the frenzy seen recently in U.S. markets. All short trades and online discussion of stocks are closely monitored, Pang said. So in a sense, protection of investors in China is greater than that of more developed markets, he added.
Livestreaming and short video apps became significant marketing channels in 2020. Short video and live streaming app Kuaishou said gross merchandise volume (GMV) for the 11 months through November grew nearly eight times from a year ago to 332.68 billion yuan ($51.44 billion). Douyin, the Chinese version of the TikTok video app that's owned by ByteDance, saw e-commerce transactions triple last year to 500 billion yuan in GMV, according to a report Wednesday from Chinese tech news site LatePost.	BEIJING — Chinese consumers are shopping more through livestreaming and video apps — a new trend that's grabbing a slice of the massive market traditionally dominated by e-commerce giant Alibaba . Popular livestreaming and short video apps became significant marketing channels in 2020, generating billions in merchant sales by connecting viewers to existing e-commerce sites, or their own. Just take the example of short video and livestreaming app Kuaishou, which on Friday raised more than $5 billion in Hong Kong's biggest IPO since the coronavirus pandemic, according to Wind Information. Gross merchandise volume (GMV) for the 11 months through November grew nearly eight times from a year ago to 332.68 billion yuan ($51.44 billion), Kuaishou said in its prospectus. GMV is a metric commonly used in e-commerce to measure the total value of goods sold over a certain period of time. The company primarily makes money by selling virtual gifts that users can buy for their favorite live streamers. Kuaishou shares surged nearly 200% at the open Friday. Douyin, the Chinese version of the TikTok video app that's owned by ByteDance, saw e-commerce transactions triple last year to 500 billion yuan in GMV, according to a report Wednesday from Chinese tech news site LatePost. However, most of the GMV went to third-party e-commerce sites like JD.com and Alibaba's Taobao, the report said. Only about 100 billion yuan in Douyin's GMV came from the app's own e-commerce platforms, the report said. ByteDance said in a statement to CNBC that LatePost's figures on GMV are not accurate and that third-party sales resulting from re-directed user traffic should not be counted as part of the GMV. Tencent 's Wechat messaging app, which counts more than 1 billion daily active users, has also become a platform for online shopping. In January, WeChat said GMV for businesses running their own mini-programs in the app rose 255% last year to an undisclosed amount, while GMV for physical goods sold through those programs rose 154%. "Along with various types of e-commerce players springing up in recent 2-3 years, including live streaming, social commerce, etc, customers' appetites on online shopping platforms are also diversifying," Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report last month. They predict Chinese consumer spending overall will double in the next decade to $12.7 trillion. The reports on video apps' GMV show how quickly the streaming platforms are growing as a portal to online shopping, even if established players still dominate. For example, Alibaba's video streaming sales site Taobao Live generated over 400 billion yuan in GMV for 2020, according to the latest earnings report. But the company's GMV for the Nov. 1 to 11 shopping holiday alone was 498 billion yuan. "There is a lot of demand in China for e-commerce, so Alibaba, JD.com, they have the market because they are both online and offline," said Suresh Dalai, senior director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal, which focuses on retail operations in Asia. "They provide a one-stop shop through their ecosystem," Dalai said. "These retailers, they're not suffering even with these new e-commerce players coming out." Online retail sales of physical goods in China rose 14.8% last year to a total of 9.759 trillion yuan, accounting for a quarter of all consumer goods sold in the country, the National Bureau of Statistics said. While the number of online shoppers climbed to 782 million by December, the country had more internet users watching videos, at 927 million, government agency China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) said in a report this week. In particular, livestreaming e-commerce users surged by 123 million between March and December, for a total of 388 million, the report said. About two-thirds of these users have made a purchase while watching a livestream, the report said.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Politburo member Yang Jiechi, a top foreign policy official, in their first high-level conversation since President Joe Biden took office. Blinken stressed human rights and warned Beijing that the U.S. would hold China accountable for its actions. Jiechi said the U.S. should not interfere in China's internal affairs and warned that Beijing won't be slandered.	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has called for China to condemn the military coup in Myanmar and warned Beijing that Washington will work with its allies to hold the People's Republic accountable for what he described as its efforts to threaten international stability particularly in the Taiwan Strait. Blinken spoke with Yang Jiechi, a member of China's Politburo and senior foreign policy official, late Friday in the first conversation between senior U.S. and Chinese officials since President Joe Biden took office. The top U.S. diplomat stressed human rights in the call, while Yang called for Washington to respect China's sovereignty. "Secretary Blinken stressed the United States will continue to stand up for human rights and democratic values, including in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong, and pressed China to join the international community in condemning the military coup in Burma," State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement . Myanmar is also referred to as Burma. The contentious call between the senior foreign policy officials in Washington and Beijing shows that relations are unlikely to improve between the world's two largest economies under the Biden administration. Yang told the U.S. not to interfere with China's internal affairs in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet. Yang warned Blinken any attempt to slander China would be unsuccessful. Tensions between the U.S. and China reached a boiling point under the Trump administration. Though President Joe Biden is reviewing a number of Trump-era foreign policy decisions, he is unlikely to reverse most of the previous administration's policies on China. Biden has already said he will not immediately remove hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs imposed by Trump against Chinese exports, as the new administration also seeks to take a tough approach on trade. The day before Biden was inaugurated, the Trump administration labelled the repression of Uighur Muslims in China's western Xinjiang province as genocide and crimes against humanity. As soon as Trump left office, Beijing imposed sanctions against former administration officials, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and trade advisor Peter Navarro. The Biden administration will uphold the genocide designation, Biden's nominee for U.N. ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said during her confirmation hearing. Biden had condemned China's actions in Xinjiang as genocide during his presidential campaign. The White House already faces its first major international flashpoint with China after the military in Myanmar overthrew and detained the country's civilian leadership earlier this month. The U.S. has warned it will take action against those responsible for the coup if they do not release the detained civilian leadership and uphold the country's democratic transition. China, for its part, has avoided condemning the coup, calling instead for a resolution of the crisis under the country's constitution. Tensions are also growing over Taiwan. Beijing claims sovereignty over Taiwan, which has self rule under the umbrella of U.S. security guarantees. Days after Biden's inauguration, China sent warplanes into the Taiwan Strait , drawing condemnation from Washington. On Thursday, a U.S. Navy warship sailed through the strait for the first time since Biden took office. "The Secretary reaffirmed that the United States will work together with its allies and partners in defense of our shared values and interests to hold the PRC accountable for its efforts to threaten stability in the Indo-Pacific, including across the Taiwan Strait, and its undermining of the rules-based international system," State Department spokesman Price said of Blinken's Friday call.

China's capital city will hand out about $1.5 million in a limited trial of the central bank's digital currency, the municipal government announced over the weekend. The total of 10 million yuan will be distributed through about 50,000 packets of 200 yuan, or about $30, each. This marks the third major test of the digital currency under development by the People's Bank of China.	BEIJING — China's capital city will hand out about $1.5 million in a limited trial of the central bank's digital currency, the municipal government announced over the weekend. That marks the third major test of the digital currency under development by the People's Bank of China. The cities of Shenzhen and Suzhou held similar experiments in the last few months. In this trial, Beijing said it will select 50,000 from a pool of applicants to receive 200 yuan, or about $30 each, in the digital currency. Recipients can spend the money at designated offline locations or on parts of e-commerce site JD.com during the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. The vouchers are valid from Feb. 10 to Feb. 17. The digital currency test is only open to those with a Chinese ID number, or residence permits from Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan. The People's Bank of China has been developing a digital currency that is expected to work in a similar way to transactions through existing payment apps. Mobile pay, primarily through the Alibaba -affiliated Alipay app and Tencent's Wechat Pay, has replaced cash in the last several years as the predominant form of consumer payment in China. Unlike well-known digital currencies like bitcoin , the one under development by China's central bank is controlled by a single power, rather than a decentralized system managed by users around the world.
China announced new anti-monopoly rules over the weekend — but that's not likely to have much impact on the market for now, argues Bank of Communications International's Hao Hong. China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) introduced new guidelines on Sunday to curb monopolistic behavior, and tightened restrictions for China's tech giants like Alibaba and Meituan. Stocks of China's internet giants in Hong Kong were mixed by the Monday market close in the city.	China announced new anti-monopoly rules over the weekend — but that's not likely to have much impact on the market for now, according to one market observer. "The new regulation is still, you know, slightly sketchy in details," Hao Hong, managing director and head of research at Bank of Communications International, told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Monday. China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) has tightened restrictions on China's internet giants such as Alibaba and Meituan , and introduced new guidelines on Sunday to curb monopolistic behavior. The new rules formalize a draft that was released months earlier. Stocks of China's internet giants in Hong Kong were mixed by the Monday market close in the city: Tencent was up 0.48% while Meituan jumped 1.25%. JD.com declined 0.6% and Alibaba shed 0.62%. Still, Monday's market moves were in sharp contrast to the volatility seen in November , when Hong Kong-listed shares of China's tech giants plummeted after the regulator's initial announcement. Billions of dollars in market value were wiped out after the anti-trust guidelines were first proposed. Hong said the market needs time to digest the details of the latest anti-monopoly guidelines, adding that China's internet giants have been operating for years and already have "very solid" market positions. "The regulation, you know, is starting with a very good intention," Hong said. "The actual fact is that ... the market position ... of these big internet platforms are very difficult to encroach for now." While Hong acknowledged that the new rules will "make it easier for the smaller guys to grow," he also added that a lot of the large internet players, like Alibaba and Tencent, have also "put their own money into many of the internet startups." Some noted examples of such investments include Alibaba's stake in financial technology giant Ant Group and Tencent's backing of short video firm Kuaishou, which saw strong investor interest on Friday during its $5 billion public listing in Hong Kong . The increased scrutiny by Beijing comes at a time where the tech industry is coming under the regulatory spotlight worldwide, with similar movements in the U.S. as well as the European Union . — CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.
Ant has yet to comment on the matter but media reports said the proposed restructuring is expected to be announced before the Chinese New Year holiday, which kicks off later this week, on Feb. 11. "There are three things that we need to be watching out for. "First is what will be the set of subsidiaries that will comprise this financial holding company," says Michael Araneta,  Associate Vice-President for IDC Financial Insights. He added the other critical factor surrounding regulation in China is over the "how much power these big tech firms" would have on the market with regards to data about customers.	Ant Group's reported move to restructure its business and turn the fintech giant into a financial holding company is a "step in the right direction," according to an analyst at independent research provider IDC Financial Insights. Ant has yet to comment on the matter but media reports said the proposed restructuring is expected to be announced before the Chinese New Year holiday, which kicks off later this week, on Feb. 11. "There are three things that we need to be watching out for," said Michael Araneta, associate vice-president for IDC Financial Insights. "First is: what will be the set of subsidiaries that will comprise this financial holding company," he told CNBC on Monday. "Secondly, what are the activities that they will be doing? And most important , there would be questions around what exactly can Ant do moving forward," he added, noting it will be "a long path to the ideal" but it will be a "step in the right direction." Ant Group — an affiliate of China's e-commerce giant Alibaba and was founded by Jack Ma — runs the popular mobile payments app Alipay in the country. Over the years, Ant has expanded into areas such as lending and wealth management. Regulators are concerned the company poses a systemic risk to the economy, and halted its $35 billion initial public offering last year — which would have been the world's largest. The reported overhaul is expected to subject Ant Group to stricter capital requirements, making it more like a bank than a technology company. The move comes as the Chinese government intensifies efforts to increase supervision of China's fast evolving fintech sector amid growing concerns over the pricing power that these large tech giants have over consumers. "It is a concern also acknowledged by Ant Group as well," noted Araneta. "And there will be expectations and more clarity coming from the regulator about what can or cannot be done by these powerhouses in the platform world of technology." He said another critical factor surrounding regulation in China is over how much power these big tech firms would have on the market with regards to data privacy. "If you look at the one billion customers that they do have a lot of data on, what can they do with that kind of data? That is going to be a question moving forward, especially around data privacy," he said. "And that's something that Ant Group will be well-prepared to resolve as well."
The audio-only social media app Clubhouse appears to have been blocked in China. The discussion app, which lets people chat with their voices instead of written messages, has boomed in popularity over the last few months. Some Clubhouse users in China are now being shown an error message when they open the app. The message reads: "An SSL error has occurred and a secure connection to the server cannot be made."	The audio-only social media app Clubhouse appears to have been blocked in China. Queeny Li, a communications professional based in Shenzhen, and Michael Norris, a tech analyst in Shanghai, told CNBC that the Clubhouse app no longer works for them. "Clubhouse has been blocked," said Norris, echoing what multiple media reports have said. "Clubhouse's ban was expected," Norris added. "Indeed, the sudden rush to give Clubhouse a whirl was driven by the sense that a ban was imminent." Some Clubhouse users in China are now being shown an error message when they open the app. The message reads: "An SSL error has occurred and a secure connection to the server cannot be made." U.S.-based Clubhouse, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese embassy in London did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. The invite-only discussion app, which lets people chat with their voices instead of written messages, has boomed in popularity over the last few months. It initially gained traction with the Silicon Valley tech community, but in recent weeks the app has been downloaded onto smartphones across China. While the iPhone app is not available to download from the Chinese App Store, people in China were able to get it by using overseas Apple IDs. Chinese ecommerce sites have been selling thousands of Clubhouse invites for up to $77, according to The Financial Times. Clubhouse, which is valued at around $1 billion and boasts over 2 million users, worked for people in China that managed to download the app and obtain an invite up until Monday, when the apparent block came in. Unlike other apps, Clubhouse was not censored by the Chinese Communist Party and users were free to talk about whatever they pleased. Chinese authorities have blocked U.S. social media apps like Facebook and Twitter, and internet search results are censored by the government. The country's digital censorship of overseas platforms has been dubbed the "Great Firewall." Meanwhile, the U.S. government has been clamping down on Chinese tech firms like Huawei and TikTok over the last few years. "At one level, China is cracking down on any technology that challenges how the government controls society," Abishur Prakash, a geopolitical specialist at the Center for Innovating the Future (CIF), told CNBC. "This is nothing new," he added. "But, at another level, China is rapidly 'unplugging' from U.S. technology, even the new platforms and services. This is further driving the split between the U.S. and China."
Tesla's sales in China more than doubled last year to $6.66 billion, according to a filing out Monday. That's about one-fifth of Tesla's sales overall, a far greater proportion than the 12% in 2019. The electric car maker has been ramping up production at its factory in Shanghai and selling China-made vehicles to the local market.	BEIJING — Tesla 's sales in China more than doubled last year amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to a filing out Monday. The electric car maker's sales in China of $6.66 billion last year accounted for about a fifth, or 21% of the $31.54 billion total. In 2019, Tesla's China sales reached $2.98 billion, just 12% of the $24.58 billion total. The U.S. remained Tesla's largest market, with sales rising 20% last year to $15.21 billion and accounting for roughly half of total sales. Tesla began ramping up production last year at its factory in Shanghai and selling China-made cars to the local market. The company's Model 3 was the best-selling electric car in the country in 2020, according to China's Passenger Car Association. The automaker also began deliveries of a new model, a China-made Model Y, to local customers this year. However, Tesla faces competition in the local market from Chinese electric car start-ups like Nio and Xpeng , while regulatory scrutiny has increased. On Monday, China's State Administration for Market Regulation said on its website that it and four other government departments recently met with Tesla's local subsidiaries over an increase in consumer reports of vehicle problems. Among several incidents that garnered attention on Chinese social media in the last few weeks, a Model 3 reportedly exploded in a Shanghai parking garage in January. Last week, Chinese authorities said Tesla needed to recall more than 36,000 cars due to a touchscreen failure.
Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei said he'd welcome a phone call from U.S. President Joe Biden in his first remarks since the change of administration in Washington. "I would welcome such phone calls and the message is around joint development and shared success," Ren said. The Trump administration took actions to hamper Huawei's access to key software and components.	TAIYUAN, China — Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei said he'd welcome a phone call from U.S. President Joe Biden, in his first public remarks since the change of administration in Washington. Ren is hoping for a softer approach toward the Chinese telecommunication giant he founded after around two years of pressure from Washington. Huawei was labeled a national security threat under the Trump administration, which took actions to hamper the company's access to key software and components. Washington alleged Huawei's networking equipment could be used to spy on Americans. Huawei has repeatedly denied those claims. "I would welcome such phone calls and the message is around joint development and shared success," Ren said in Chinese comments translated by an official interpreter during a briefing with reporters. "The U.S. wants to have economic growth and China wants to have economic growth as well." The Huawei boss tried to appeal to the economic interests of American companies, and said some of them have seen their businesses impacted from not being able to supply to the Chinese firm . "If Huawei's production capacity can be expanded, that would mean more opportunities for U.S. companies to supply too. I believe that's going to be mutually beneficially. I believe that (the) new administration would bear in mind such business interests as they are about to decide their new policy," Ren said. "We still hope that we can buy in large volume American materials components as well as equipment so that we can all benefit from China's growth." Ren was speaking on the sidelines of an event in which Huawei opened a new lab in the northern Chinese city of Taiyuan focused on bringing technology to the mining industry. Huawei has been cut off from some technology. In 2019, Huawei was placed on a U.S. Entity List , which restricted American firms from exporting technology to the company. Google is no longer allowed to license its Android mobile operating system to Huawei, a move which has caused the Chinese telecom giant's global smartphone sales to plunge . The U.S. also moved to cut Huawei off from key chip supplies . Ren struck an optimistic tone saying that his confidence "rose" in the last year around "Huawei's ability to survive." That came despite the difficulties in their smartphone business as well as some countries over the last 12 month, such as the U.K., blocking Huawei from its 5G market. "We have more means to overcome the difficulties," Ren said. Huawei also achieved positive revenue and net profit growth for 2020, the CEO said, without giving specific numbers. Revenue for 2019 totaled 858.8 billion yuan ($122.97 billon) while net profit came in at 62.7 billion yuan. Questions about the future of Huawei's smartphone business have been swirling, given the company has not been able to access chips that were manufactured by TSMC. Those cutting edge chips were part of the reason Huawei was able to rise to one of the biggest smartphone players in the world. In response, Huawei sold off its budget Honor smartphone brand in November , a move that would allow that particular unit to survive and regain access to components. Reuters reported in January that Huawei is also in talks to sell its premium Mate and P brands of smartphones. But Ren said Huawei would "never" sell its smartphone business. He also said that Huawei would not be investing in chip technology. — Correction: This article has been updated to accurately reflect that Huawei's revenue for 2019 totaled $122.97 billon.

Liang Wannian, head of the expert Covid-19 panel at China's National Health Commission, said ongoing research into the origins of the virus must focus on how it circulated in animals before infecting humans. Scientists have been working in the Chinese city of Wuhan for the past four weeks as part of their search for clues to the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. The investigators visited hospitals, laboratories and markets, including the Huanan Seafood Market, the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Wuhan Center for Disease Control laboratory.	An international team of scientists led by the World Health Organization said Tuesday that the coronavirus "most likely" originated in animals before spreading to humans and dismissed a theory that the disease had been leaked by a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Scientists have been working in Wuhan, where the disease was identified, for the past four weeks as part of their search for clues to the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. The long-awaited probe comes after months of negotiations between China and WHO about the arrangements of the investigation. The delay raises questions about the reliability of the findings. The investigators have visited hospitals, laboratories and markets, including the Huanan Seafood Market, the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Wuhan Center for Disease Control laboratory. The visit, which has been shrouded in secrecy, was also expected to see researchers speak with early responders as well as some of the first patients. The team completed two weeks of quarantine before beginning to visit local sites . Dr. Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO's food safety and animal disease specialist and chairman of the investigation team, told reporters the "most likely" pathway for Covid was a crossover into humans from an intermediary species. This hypothesis will "require more studies and more specific (and) targeted research," he said. The initial findings of the investigation did not find evidence of large Covid outbreaks in Wuhan or elsewhere before December 2019. However, researchers did find evidence of wider Covid circulation outside the Huanan Seafood Market that month, Ben Embarek said. He added it was not yet possible to pinpoint the animal intermediary host for the coronavirus, describing the findings after nearly a month of meetings and site visits as "work in progress." "In terms of understanding what happened in the early days of December 2019, did we change dramatically the picture we had beforehand? I don't think so," Ben Embarek said. "Did we improve our understanding? Did we add details to that story? Absolutely," he said. The WHO has sought to manage expectations of a definitive conclusion to the origins of the Covid pandemic. To put the mission in a broader context, it took more than a decade to find the origins of SARS, while the origins of Ebola — first identified in the 1970s — is still not yet known. It is hoped that information of the earliest known cases of the coronavirus, first detected in Wuhan in late 2019, could help to identify how the outbreak started and prevent future pandemics. A theory that the coronavirus was leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology was discredited by the WHO investigators. The hypothesis had been perpetuated by former President Donald Trump's administration, without the weight of evidence, and strenuously denied by Chinese officials. "The laboratory incident hypothesis is extremely unlikely to explain the introduction of the virus into the human population," Ben Embarek said. "Therefore, [it] is not in the hypotheses that we will suggest for future studies." The team had reached the conclusion that a lab leak should be regarded as extremely unlikely "on the basis of a serious discussion and very diligent research," added Liang Wannian, head of the expert Covid panel at China's National Health Commission. Speaking alongside Ben Embarek from the Hilton Optics Valley Hotel in Wuhan, Liang said ongoing research into the origins of the virus must focus on how it circulated in animals before infecting humans. Bats and pangolins are potential candidates for transmission, Liang said, but samples from these species were not found to be "sufficiently similar" to the coronavirus. The high susceptibility of minks and cats to the virus indicates there may be other animals that serve as reservoirs, Liang continued, but research remains inconclusive. China's National Health Commission spokesperson said there could have been an unreported circulation of the coronavirus before it was detected in Wuhan. However, Liang said there was no evidence of substantial Covid circulation in Wuhan before the late 2019 outbreak. The WHO has previously cited genetic sequencing that showed the coronavirus had started in bats and likely jumped to another animal before infecting humans. Many of the people who had fallen ill with the new virus in Wuhan, a city with a population of roughly 11 million, were reported to have had links to the Huanan Seafood Market. Scientists initially suspected the virus came from wild animals sold at the seafood market, prompting China to swiftly restrict public access to the market at the beginning of last year. China's CDC has since said samples taken from the seafood market suggest it was a place where the virus spread, not where the outbreak first emerged. On Tuesday, Liang said the Huanan Seafood Market was one of the places where the coronavirus first emerged, but he added it was not possible with current evidence to determine how the virus was introduced to the seafood market. The origins of the coronavirus remain important because the virus is constantly evolving, as highly infectious mutant strains identified in the U.K. and South Africa demonstrate. More than 106 million people have contracted the coronavirus worldwide, killing at least 2.32 million people, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S., by far, has reported the highest number of confirmed Covid cases and deaths, with more than 27 million reported infections and 465,072 fatalities. China has published little information on its research into the origins of the virus, and there had been widespread international concern about what the researchers in Wuhan will be allowed to see and do as part of their investigation. — CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.
The NATO alliance will meet Wednesday and Thursday to discuss an array of challenges facing the 30-member strong group. The virtual meetings will be a glimpse into President Joe Biden's foreign policy agenda. Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison shared her insight with CNBC on some of the most pressing issues facing the alliance.	WASHINGTON – Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will meet with members of the world's most powerful military alliance on Wednesday for the first time since joining the Biden administration. NATO meets Wednesday and Thursday to discuss an array of challenges facing the 30-member group. The virtual meetings will be a glimpse into President Joe Biden's foreign policy agenda and comes on the heels of his calls to stand "shoulder to shoulder" with America's closest allies . "When we strengthen our alliances we amplify our power as well as our ability to disrupt threats before they reach our shores," Biden said during a speech at the State Department. "America cannot afford to be absent any longer on the world stage," he added. Biden's message broke sharply from his predecessor's "America First" policy, which on occasion seemed to vex NATO members. Under former President Donald Trump, Kay Bailey Hutchison served as the connective tissue between Washington and the alliance in her role as the U.S. Ambassador to NATO. "There was never a rift or tension among the ambassadors and me," she told CNBC when asked if the alliance was impacted by Trump's approach. "Now, that's not to say that some of the allies weren't upset with what the president had said or done on a given day. But overall we had a great relationship and always kept everyone informed," Hutchison explained, elaborating on the wider policy goals shared by NATO members. "I think the alliance is strong and unified and I think everyone knows that the U.S. is essential in NATO," the former Senator from Texas said, adding that the United States will continue to take a prominent leadership role within the group. Ahead of the virtual meetings this week, Hutchison shared what she expects will be high on the alliance's agenda. The tension between Beijing and Washington soared under the Trump administration, which escalated a trade war and worked to ban Chinese technology companies from doing business in the United States. Over the past four years, the Trump administration blamed China for a wide range of grievances, including intellectual property theft, unfair trade practices and recently, the coronavirus pandemic . Biden previously said that his approach to China would be different from his predecessor's in that he would work more closely with allies in order to mount pushback against Beijing. "We will confront China's economic abuses," Biden explained in a speech at the State Department, describing Beijing as America's "most serious competitor." "But we're also ready to work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so. We'll compete from a position of strength by building back better at home and working with our allies and partners." Hutchison said that many of the issues the Biden administration looks to address with China also fall into shared interests held by the NATO alliance. "We have been really focusing on China much more in the last two years," Hutchison said. "When the Belt and Road initiative came out and then, of course, the crackdown on Hong Kong, Covid-19 and the lack of transparency on that, all really brought China into the NATO radar." Hutchison explained that the members will discuss the great power competition, which is used to describe the friction between the United States and China in shaping security practices and setting trade norms worldwide. Russia is sometimes included as an element in the power struggle. She also said that as the Pentagon began to stand up a new military branch dedicated to space, the United States Space Force, the NATO alliance also expanded its mission and declared space a security domain. "That was because China is doing a lot up there with satellites and artificial intelligence, and we are now having to focus on that and begin to build deterrence as best we can," Hutchison said of the move by NATO leaders to include space in its security portfolio. "Cyber and hybrid, of course, is another big area where both China and Russia are active," she added. Like China, Biden has also said that the United States will have a different approach in dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin. "I made it very clear to President Putin in a manner very different from my predecessor that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russian aggressive actions, interfering with our elections, cyberattacks, poisoning its citizens, are over," Biden said earlier this month. "We will be more effective in dealing with Russia when we work in coalition and coordination with other like-minded partners," he added. The White House is currently reviewing other maligned Russian actions including the SolarWinds hack, reports of Russian bounties on American troops in Afghanistan and potential election interference. "There was never any let-up in NATO regarding Russia," Hutchison told CNBC when asked about the alliance's approach. "And I don't think there'll be a change in course because I think we've been tough about Russia," she added. Hutchison said that in the wake of the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the NATO alliance was swift to condemn Moscow's actions. "There was a unanimous vote of our allies calling out Russia on the Navalny issue when it was first, of course, clear that Russia had poisoned this man," Hutchison said. Last summer, Navalny was medically evacuated to Germany from a Russian hospital after he became ill following reports that something was added to his tea. Russian doctors treating Navalny denied that the Kremlin critic had been poisoned and blamed his comatose state on low blood sugar levels. In September, the German government said that the 44-year-old Russian dissident was poisoned by a chemical nerve agent, describing the toxicology report as providing " unequivocal evidence. " The nerve agent was in the family of Novichok, which was developed by the Soviet Union . The Kremlin has repeatedly denied having a role in Navalny's poisoning. Last month, Navalny flew to Russia from Berlin, Germany where he spent nearly half a year recovering. He was arrested at passport control and later sentenced to more than two years in prison . Hutchison also explained that the alliance will need to discuss the messy, multibillion-dollar deal between Russia and Turkey, which led to unprecedented U.S. sanctions on the NATO member. In 2017, Turkish President Recep Erdogan brokered a deal reportedly worth $2.5 billion with Putin for the S-400 missile system. The S-400, a mobile surface-to-air missile system, is said to pose a risk to the NATO alliance as well as the F-35, America's most expensive weapons platform. In short, these two big-ticket weapons systems that Turkey hoped to add to its budding arsenal could be used against each other. Under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which Trump signed in August 2017, Turkey faced potential economic sanctions for accepting the Kremlin's missile system. Despite warnings from the United States and other NATO allies, Turkey accepted the first of four missile batteries in July 2019. A week later, the United States cut Turkey, a financial and manufacturing partner, from the F-35 program . In October, the Pentagon and State Department issued strong rebukes following reports that Turkey's military tested the Russia-made missile system . In December, Washington slapped sanctions on the country . "It's a huge problem and it's one that Turkey kept thinking, apparently, that this could all be worked out. But you can't work out a Russian missile defense system in the NATO alliance and have business as usual," Hutchison explained to CNBC. "Everyone in NATO knows it's a problem and Turkey needs to find an off-ramp for this," she added. The wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria have cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1.57 trillion since Sept. 11, 2001, according to a Defense Department report . The war in Afghanistan, which is now America's longest conflict, began 19 years ago and has cost U.S. taxpayers $193 billion, according to the Pentagon . Last February the United States brokered a deal with the Taliban that would usher in a permanent cease-fire and reduce the U.S. military's footprint from approximately 13,000 troops to 8,600 by mid-July last year. By May 2021, all foreign forces would leave the war-weary country, according to the deal. There are about 2,500 U.S. troops in the country. Currently, the U.S. is slated to withdraw American service members from Afghanistan by May 1, 2021. "I told all the Biden people when we were in transition that they were really going to have to make the decision about whether they want to draw down by the first of May or draw down over a different time period or not draw down and keep troops there," Hutchison explained to CNBC. "All the vibes I'm getting, without talking to anyone specifically, is that they are going to leave troops there and not draw down further," she added. Read more: Pentagon uncertain on pullback date for U.S. troops in Afghanistan Last month, the Pentagon said the U.S. troop drawdown in Afghanistan would be contingent on the Taliban's commitments to uphold a peace deal brokered last year. "The Taliban have not met their commitments," Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters during a Jan. 28 press briefing. He added that Austin was reviewing the matter and had discussed the path forward in the war-torn country with NATO allies and partners. "It is under discussion with our partners and allies to make the best decisions going forward on our force presence in Afghanistan," Kirby said, adding that the Biden administration has not yet made a determination. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg previously warned that leaving Afghanistan too soon or in an uncoordinated effort could present unintended consequences for the world's largest military organization. "Afghanistan risks becoming once again a platform for international terrorists to plan and organize attacks on our homelands. And ISIS could rebuild in Afghanistan the terror caliphate it lost in Syria and Iraq," the NATO chief said, referring to Islamic State militants. In February, the Afghanistan Study Group , a bipartisan congressionally mandated panel under the United States Institute of Peace, recommended keeping U.S. troops in the war-torn country "in order to give the peace process sufficient time to produce an acceptable result." The group wrote, in a report released on February 3, that the United States has a significant interest in safeguarding Afghanistan from "becoming again a safe haven for terrorists." "We believe that a U.S. withdrawal will provide the terrorists an opportunity to reconstitute and our judgment is that reconstitution will take place within about 18 to 36 months," former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford told a virtual United States Institute of Peace audience. Dunford, a retired four-star Marine general, co-chairs the study group. "We also conclude and there will be no surprise to those who follow Afghanistan, that the Afghan forces are highly dependent on U.S. funding in operational support and they'll continue to be for some time to come," Dunford said. NATO joined the international security effort in Afghanistan in 2003 and currently has more than 7,000 troops in the country. The NATO mission in Afghanistan was launched after the alliance activated its mutual defense clause — known as Article 5 — for the first time in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. "I think there's a lot that will be decided and it will be pivotal what the administration and Secretary Austin say," Hutchison told CNBC. "The allies are going to be looking for what the U.S. is intending because of course, we provide the enablers for the train-and-advise mission of NATO there," she added. Hutchison also added that the alliance may discuss the possibility of expanding the training-and-advising mission in Iraq.

China's National Radio and Television Administration said Friday that it won't allow BBC World News to continue airing inside China. It accused the BBC of failing to meet the requirement for news to be truthful and fair, and accused it of damaging China's national interests. The ban comes after Ofcom, the U.K.'s media regulator, withdrew the license for CGTN, which is China's English language news channel.	LONDON — There was one less TV channel for China's 1.4 billion people to tune into during this Lunar New Year after the nation banned the BBC from broadcasting to its citizens. China's National Radio and Television Administration said Friday that it won't allow BBC World News to continue airing inside China and in Hong Kong. It accused the BBC of failing to meet the requirement for news to be truthful and fair, and accused it of damaging China's national interests. The BBC said in a statement: "The BBC is the world's most trusted international news broadcaster and reports on stories around the world fairly, impartially and without fear or favour." It added: "We are disappointed that the Chinese authorities have decided to take this course of action." The BBC has recently covered a number of sensitive issues in China, including its treatment of the minority Uighur people in China's Xinjiang province. On Feb. 2, the BBC reported on the alleged rape and torture of women in "re-education" camps for Uighurs. The Chinese government told the BBC the allegations were "completely unfounded." It said the "centers" in Xinjiang are designed to combat extremism and develop Uighurs' vocational skills. On the coronavirus, the BBC broadcast footage in December of what appeared to be people being aggressively hauled away for testing by authorities. It also questioned whether China's death figures can be trusted. China has criticized the BBC for its reporting on Xinjiang and the coronavirus. The Chinese embassy in London did not respond to a CNBC request for comment but the Chinese government says that its response to the virus has been swift and effective. Tim Davie, the head of the BBC, hit back at China's decision on Saturday, saying "media freedom matters." The broadcaster's director general said on Twitter that the latest developments are "deeply worrying" and argued that the BBC should be able to do its reporting "without fear or favour." He added: "It is of deep concern when our journalists are restricted and their work curtailed." British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Thursday that China's decision to ban BBC World News in mainland China is an "unacceptable curtailing" of media freedom. "China has some of the most severe restrictions on media and internet freedoms across the globe, and this latest step will only damage China's reputation in the eyes of the world," he said on Twitter. CNBC has reached out to the Chinese embassy in London for comment. The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China, a professional association of Beijing-based journalists, said it was concerned by the reasons China's National Radio and Television Administration gave for the BBC ban, including the charge that BBC broadcasts have harmed China's national interests and undermined China's national unity. The FCCC said it thinks such language is "intended to send a warning to foreign media operating in China that they may face sanctions if their reporting does not follow the Chinese party line about Xinjiang and other ethnic minority regions." A BBC employee, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the discussion, told CNBC that it's "obviously worrying for the audience over there that a neutral news service has gone." Meanwhile, Matthew Brennan, a China-based technology analyst, told CNBC that the block is a shame, but not unsurprising. The ban comes after Ofcom, the U.K.'s media regulator, withdrew the license for CGTN, which is China's English language news channel. Ofcom said on Feb. 4 that CGTN had filed misleading ownership statements and is "ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party." Richard Sambrook, the former director of the BBC's Global News division, which was responsible for leading the BBC's international news services, told CNBC that the BBC ban is a direct response. "China has predictably responded in kind against BBC World News," said Sambrook, who is now the director of the Center of Journalism at Cardiff University. "China already bans BBC services in Chinese languages and to a large extent the BBC's online site. These kind of 'tit-for-tat' media moves are reminiscent of past years (during the cold war for example) when they were not unusual." Sambrook added: "The moves can perhaps best be seen to reflect a chilling of relationships between the U.K. and China — in line with a shift in relationships between China and the West more broadly." Sambrook said BBC World News, which is a commercial operation, will lose out on some income as a result of the ban. Rasmus Nielsen, director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford, said the BBC decision can't be compared to the CGTN decision. While the Ofcom decision was about the ownership structure of CGTN, China's decision to block the BBC was to do with content, Nielsen said. Nielsen pointed out that anyone in the U.K. can still access CGTN, they just can't watch it on TV. "It's important to remember that while symbolically important, television distribution is trivial really in terms of CGTN's reach in the U.K. and beyond," Nielsen said, adding that the channel had less than a million viewers, which is less than half of the Sky Cinema Sci-Fi Horror channel. "The real audience for that outlet is arguably online and the Ofcom decision doesn't change anything about anyone's ability to access CGTN content on its website, via Facebook, via Twitter, via YouTube, or any other means." Kerry Allen, a Chinese media analyst at BBC News who translates, writes, edits and broadcasts stories that have a Chinese media angle, pointed out that the latest move won't have a huge impact on people in China. "It (the BBC World News TV channel) can only really be found in hotels and diplomatic compounds, and viewers are accustomed to seeing the screen suddenly turn black when China stories are reported," she said. "Chinese media have recently wanted to paint a picture of the U.K. suppressing Chinese voices, and instead highlighting damning reports on China," said Allen. "There's a certain irony in government media taking this stance, as this is something that China has already done long-term — censored any media organization that contradicts government rhetoric, and stories that paints China in a negative light." Allen pointed out that people in the country are able to access the BBC website and BBC radio stations when they use a VPN, or a virtual private network. Nielsen said China's decision to ban BBC World News is more to do with politics than it is to do with media. He said it can't really be seen as anything but a "warning shot that any sort of restrictions on China's ability to project soft power overseas can be met with similar steps in China itself." "I think both international media and international journalists are wondering about to what degree and for how long they will be able to report from the mainland in particular if they report on issues that the Chinese government considers sensitive or controversial."
Expanding U.S. tariffs of 25% to all trade with China could cost the U.S. $190 billion a year in GDP, according to a report released Wednesday by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Rhodium Group. If the U.S. is forced to sell half of its direct investments in China, that would cost American investors $25 billion a year in capital gains and up to $500 billion in GDP losses, the report said. U.S. businesses risk losing global competitiveness if sweeping policies force separation from China, the report said.	BEIJING — The U.S. economy could lose more than $1 trillion worth of production and long-term global competitiveness if the White House pursues a sharp separation with China, according to a report released Wednesday by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Rhodium Group. As U.S. President Joe Biden looks set to retain his predecessor's tough stance on China, the authors of the report laid out estimates for the enormous costs of sweeping — rather than targeted — policies to protect U.S. national security from Beijing's growing economic and technological clout. These projected losses include: Research for the 92-page report began in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic hammered the global economy. Tensions between the U.S. and China escalated in the last three years under former President Donald Trump. His administration sought to use tariffs, sanctions and greater scrutiny of cross-border financial flows to address longstanding complaints about China's lack of intellectual property protections, forced technology transfers and significant role of the state in business operations. The costs of the world's two largest economies separating range far beyond immediate dollar figures. Sweeping U.S. policies directed at China will also affect other countries, forcing them to reconsider their relationships with the U.S., the report said. It added that these moves will increase costs for American businesses and reduce their ability to compete globally. The report looked specifically at the impact of wide-ranging White House policy in the aviation, semiconductor, chemicals and medical devices industries. For example, losing out on China's massive market for airplanes could cost the U.S. $875 billion by 2038, according to the authors' analysis. To address national security goals, the report said the U.S. government should pursue "narrowly tailored actions" such as restrictions on the export of specific technology licenses. Cutting U.S. businesses off from the Chinese market completely will likely have greater consequences for America's global leadership in the long term, the report said. "It is critical that U.S. chip firms retain access to the Chinese market and are able to reinvest revenues from their China sales back into U.S.- based chip production and R&D to maintain their global leadership position, enabling the U.S. to set the standards for the future." Ultimately, successful U.S.-China policy will have its costs and require some painful adjustments, the report said. "In the policy reengineering to come," the report said, "the central role of market forces in determining winners, and the finite capacity of governments to redistribute resources to ease the process, must be respected."
U.S. President Joe Biden would find it difficult to pursue policies that would gather Asian "swing states" against China, said James Crabtree of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. Part of the challenge stems from Biden's promise to rebuild the American middle class, said Crabtree. Domestic pressure could challenge attempts by the Biden administration to strike deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership that would allow the U.S. to be closer to Asia, he said.	U.S. President Joe Biden may find it difficult to gather Asian "swing states" into a coalition against China, a political analyst told CNBC. Part of that challenge stems from Biden's promise to rebuild the American middle class — which could hamper efforts to push economic and trade policies that Asian countries would sign up to, said James Crabtree, a professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. "What the U.S. has done traditionally is, it's tried to use both its security and economic power to entice allies into its camp. So for instance, it set up the original TPP trade agreement," Crabtree told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Friday. TPP refers to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact negotiated by former President Barack Obama and 11 other countries — most of them in Asia-Pacific, which excludes China. The deal in its original form would have been the world's largest trade agreement, covering nearly 40% of the global economy. It would have enhanced the strategic role of the U.S. in Asia-Pacific , and counter-balance China's growing political and economic clout in the region. But the agreement was widely criticized in the U.S. and never approved by Congress. Detractors — which include former President Donald Trump — said the TPP would accelerate the decline of U.S. manufacturing and hurt American workers. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal in 2017 and the remaining 11 countries renegotiated and signed an agreement renamed the  Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP. Domestic pressure could continue to challenge attempts by the Biden administration to strike deals that would attract the region's major exporting economies. "Biden has promised a trade and economic policy which is only going to benefit the American middle class," said Crabtree. "If he actually does that, it's much more difficult then to try and strike economic agreements with … the big Asian exporting countries that are the swing states against China. It's much more difficult for the U.S. to entice them into a broader anti-China alliance," he added. Over the last few years, China has expanded its influence in Asia-Pacific as the U.S. appeared to be pulling back from the region under Trump's leadership. One major development that boosted China's standing was the signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP — the world's largest trade deal championed by Beijing that excludes the U.S. Some analysts said at that time the deal was a "coup" for Beijing. There's been renewed optimism that the Biden administration would reengage with the world and the region again. Early signs have indeed pointed to that direction, with Biden beefing up his foreign policy team with experts on Asia. But the U.S. is not likely to make any moves on China before fall, according to Clete Willems, a former trade negotiator with the Trump administration. He pointed to remarks by the White House, which said it will review all national security measures imposed by Trump, including the U.S.-China "phase one" trade deal that paused a damaging trade war between the two countries. "They're saying: 'We're gonna review everything that has been done on China, we got to have these conversations abroad'," Willems, who's now a partner at law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Monday. "I think they probably want to get through the G-7 summit in the summer, and then I think in the fall is where it's really gonna be go time for them and they're really gonna have to make some decisions on how to move forward," he added. Biden would have to find "imaginative" ways to reassert U.S. leadership in Asia, said Crabtree. "The reality is that America's economic weight is declining, China's is increasing. And China is also doing a pretty good job of stealing America's clothes as the protector of free trade in the region," he said. "The big question is: Are they going to go back into the TPP? I think lots of people in Washington think that they should — but the politics is so difficult it's not clear if they can."
China would like the U.S. to remove tariffs and sanctions on companies, and "abandon irrational suppression of China's technological progress, so as to create necessary conditions for China-U.S. cooperation," Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Monday. He was speaking at a forum in Beijing with the theme "Bringing China-U.S. Relations Back to the Right Track." Wang also laid out areas in which the two countries could cooperate, and emphasized that Beijing remains supportive of U.S. businesses in China.	BEIJING — China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday called on the new U.S. administration to stop the "suppression" of Chinese technology companies, as he laid out conditions for U.S.-China cooperation going forward. Citing national security concerns, former U.S. President Donald Trump sanctioned dozens of Chinese companies in the last three years. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei is one of the most prominent companies that suffered from those orders, falling from the number one smartphone vendor globally to sixth place last year as a result of the sanctions. China would like the U.S. to remove tariffs and sanctions on companies, and "abandon irrational suppression of China's technological progress, so as to create necessary conditions for China-U.S. cooperation," Wang said, according to an official English translation shared by the foreign ministry. Wang also called for the U.S. to support international Chinese students and remove restrictions on cultural groups and media outlets in America. He was speaking at a forum in Beijing with the theme "Bringing China-U.S. Relations Back to the Right Track." Tensions between the two countries accelerated under the Trump administration, which sought to use levies and blacklists to address longstanding business complaints about China's lack of intellectual property protection, requirements for forced technology transfer and dominance of the state in markets. While it remains unclear what exact action U.S. President Joe Biden might take, he has maintained a firm tone since taking office about a month ago. Biden told European allies in a speech Friday that "we must prepare for long-term strategic competition with China." Last week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Trump-era tariffs would remain in place and that any changes would depend on China's adherence to trade deal commitments. Biden is expected to put greater emphasis on human rights-related issues such as Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet. Wang reiterated Monday that those regions are part of China's "internal affairs" and that relations with the U.S. can only improve if Beijing's position is respected. Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, also said Monday that Beijing and Washington must define the boundaries of their foreign policy, noting that China's red line issues include Taiwan, Xinjiang and Tibet, according to Reuters . Leaders of both countries remain open to cooperation in some areas, such as reducing carbon emissions. Wang said the two nations can work together on tackling the coronavirus pandemic and supporting global economic recovery, and emphasized that Beijing remains supportive of American businesses in China. Analysis released last week from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, together with onsulting firm Rhodium Group, found that if the U.S. sells half its direct investment in China, American investors would lose $25 billion a year in capital gains. The report called for targeted, rather than sweeping, policy measures against China.
The World Health Organization is holding a briefing tat 10 a.m. ET to brief the public on the development and rollout of Covid-19 vaccines. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House's Chief Medical Officer and director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is scheduled to join the briefing. Dr. Nancy Messonier, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory, is also expected to speak.

Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.] U.S. health officials are joining the World Health Organization for the first time since the pandemic started at a press conference Monday to update the public on the coronavirus outbreak which has infected more than 111.5 million people across the world. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House's chief medical advisor and director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is scheduled to join the briefing along with Dr. Nancy Messonier, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Lee Bollinger, president of Columbia University, will also join the briefing. The focus of the briefing will be the research, development and rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, the WHO said. The U.S. has authorized the Pfizer - BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to also authorize Johnson & Johnson 's vaccine in the coming weeks. The WHO has also issued an emergency use listing for AstraZeneca 's vaccine, which is not yet authorized in the U.S. Read CNBC's live updates to see the latest news on the Covid-19 outbreak.
Even as U.S. President Joe Biden and his team focus on improving domestic growth, they recognize that it's critical to create the conditions for global trade to thrive, according to Eric Robertsen from Standard Chartered. In addition, Robertsen noted that it is unlikely the Biden administration will use currency as a tool to influence its trade agenda.	Standard Chartered Bank is bullish on U.S.-China relations and expects ties between the two countries to improve in the next "12 to 24 months," according to Eric Robertsen, chief strategist and global head of research at the bank. Even as U.S. President Joe Biden and his team are focused on improving domestic growth, they recognize it is critical to create conditions for global trade to thrive, Robertsen said in an interview with CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Monday. "I don't think that means they will abandon some of the tactics that were used by the Trump administration," he said. "The Biden team has made it very clear that they think that the tariffs strategy was flawed. That being said, I don't think they're going to reverse it tomorrow either," he noted, adding that "they will use it as part of  a broader negotiating strategy." U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in an interview with CNBC last week: "For the moment, we've kept the tariffs in place that were, you know, put in place by the Trump administration." However, she added that the Biden administration will evaluate how to proceed going forward. The White House also said last month it would review all national security measures put in place by the Trump administration, including the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade deal . Trump signed the initial trade agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping in January 2020, pausing a nearly 18-month trade war in which U.S. and Chinese goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars were hit by retaliatory tariffs. Despite current trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, Robertsen is optimistic about improving relations between the two countries. "I do see some areas for potentially common ground between the U.S. and China, climate being one of them. This is one area where both countries could make significant commitments to improvement and that might lay the groundwork for more compromise in other areas," he said. "I'm relatively optimistic that over the course of 12 to 24 months, you will see a better narrative of U.S. and China relations." In addition, Robertsen noted that it is unlikely the Biden administration will use currency as a tool to influence its trade agenda. "It is our belief that the Trump administration used this label of currency manipulator as one of many tools to try and help them achieve or pursue specific trade agendas," he said. "I think Biden will be less aggressive with that particular tactic." Last year, the U.S. Treasury Department under Trump labeled Switzerland and Vietnam as currency manipulators. It also added India, Thailand and Taiwan to a list of countries it says may be deliberately devaluing their currencies against the U.S. dollar. A weak currency makes a country's exports cheaper internationally, in turn making those exports more attractive. The Biden administration wants currency markets "to operate freely and effectively, with as little intervention as possible," according to Robertsen.
"The Longer Telegram" released in late January laid out a detailed proposal for how the new U.S. administration should deal with a rising China under its Communist Party government. The anonymous author is a "former senior U.S. government official," according to the D.C.-based think tank Atlantic Council that published the lengthy paper. So far in Beijing, major Chinese state media have not discussed the paper much, while the foreign ministry said such comments against the ruling Communist Party were "a collection of rumors and conspiracy theories"	BEIJING — A recent U.S. strategy paper on China that's widely read in Washington, D.C., has drawn only a passing response in Beijing where limited public discussion has focused on one point: The author got China wrong. "The Longer Telegram" released in late January proposed how the new U.S. administration should deal with a rising China by laying out a detailed critique of the Communist Party government under President Xi Jinping . An effective U.S. approach on China requires the "same disciplined approach it applied to the defeat of the Soviet Union," the paper said. "US strategy must remain laser focused on Xi, his inner circle, and the Chinese political context in which they rule." The anonymous author is a "former senior U.S. government official," according to the D.C.-based think tank Atlantic Council that published the lengthy paper. The piece attempts to echo a historic document that shaped Washington's policy on the Soviet Union — named the "The Long Telegram," it was sent from Moscow in February 1946 at the dawn of the Cold War. So far in Beijing, major state media have not discussed the paper much, except for the vociferous state-backed tabloid Global Times, and even then, almost entirely in English. "'Longer Telegram' a late-stage hegemonic farce," read the title of one op-ed. On the official news website of China's People's Liberation Army , an article in Chinese portrayed the strategy piece as holding an outdated mentality, and contrasted its view of the country with a recent state media report about a Chinese woman's ability to rise from poverty. China's foreign ministry — in response to a question from a Global Times reporter — criticized "The Longer Telegram" for its call to contain China. The ministry said, according to an official translation, that such comments against the ruling Communist Party were "a collection of rumors and conspiracy theories" and attempts to drive U.S.-China relations toward conflict would result in "total failure." The sparse state-level comments come as tensions brew between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies and run by vastly different government systems. "The Longer Telegram" generated much controversy in the U.S. foreign policy world, with critics saying the paper mischaracterizes China and puts too much emphasis on the role of Xi. But many agree with the paper's call for a more thought-out U.S. policy on China. That growing cohesion around a tougher U.S. stance on China is a source of concern in Beijing. "The Longer Telegram" doesn't represent China's reality and isn't a good starting point for dialogue, said Shen Yamei, deputy director and associate research fellow at state-backed think tank China Institute of International Studies' U.S. department. According to Shen, the mistake the paper makes is that it isn't applicable in this situation, since China didn't say it wanted to replace the U.S. She added that it's the U.S. that cares about whether it will lose its central position in the world. Critics say China's state-dominated system benefited from being allowed to join the World Trade Organization in 2001 without rapidly incorporating the sort of free-market and rules-based system that countries like the U.S. have advocated. To counter these developments, "The Longer Telegram" says the U.S. should set clear red lines and points of national security for Beijing that, if crossed, would induce a firm U.S. response. Some of these red lines include a Chinese military attack or economic blockade on Taiwan, according to the report, which also said the U.S. should push back more firmly on any Chinese threats to U.S. global communications systems. The author of the original "Long Telegram" in 1946 was American diplomat George Kennan, who responded from Moscow to a U.S. State Department query on Soviet foreign policy. Kennan published a related article the next year in the Foreign Affairs magazine under the pseudonym "X" and in 1952 began a brief term as U.S. ambassador to Moscow. In his paper, Kennan held that the Russians were set on expanding the Soviet system worldwide and against coexistence with the West. He believed that rather than appeasement, the U.S. should use pressure to achieve cooperation with the Soviet government, or potentially even its internal collapse . For more than 70 years — including the Soviet Union's disintegration in 1991 — the U.S. led a so-called liberal world order in which international institutions set rules for a global system. That's begun to shift in the last decade or so, with China's growing economic and technological clout, alongside former U.S. President Donald Trump's single-handed approach to foreign policy. It's not yet clear what action President Joe Biden will take, but he is sticking to a tough stance on China, albeit with a calmer tone than the previous administration. "The challenges with Russia may be different than ones with China, but they're just as real," Biden told European allies in a speech last week. Biden held his first phone call as president with Xi earlier this month. The U.S. president and first lady also issued a video greeting for the Lunar New Year, which was shared widely on Chinese social media. Scattered online commentary about "The Longer Telegram" have remained dismissive. In a roughly 30-minute video from Feb. 5 that has more than 900,000 views, Fudan University professor Shen Yi dismissed as a joke the paper's attempt to replicate Kennan's efforts. An online article from Feb. 7 by Zhongnan University of Economics and Law professor Qiao Xinsheng said in an online article the strategy paper fails to accurately analyze the Soviet Union's own difficulties and that the U.S. should not expect China to "disintegrate."
The southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu announced Tuesday it will hand out roughly $6 million in the latest test of the central bank's digital currency. The scale of the trial is much larger than one in Beijing earlier this month, which aimed to distribute roughly $1.5 million to 50,000 applicants. Other cities like Shenzhen and Suzhou have held their own tests of the People's Bank of China's digital currency in the last few months.	BEIJING — The southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu announced Tuesday it will hand out roughly $6 million in the latest test of the central bank's digital currency. The scale of the trial is much larger than one in Beijing earlier this month, which aimed to distribute roughly $1.5 million to 50,000 applicants. Other cities like Shenzhen and Suzhou have held their own tests of the People's Bank of China's digital currency in the last few months. Chengdu city said locals can join a lottery Wednesday and Thursday for one of roughly 200,000 vouchers. They are worth about $27 to $37 each, for a total handout of 40.2 million yuan ($6.2 million) in the digital currency. Like the Beijing handout, the Chengdu trial is tied to the Lunar New Year and will work with local retailers and the JD.com e-commerce app. Lottery winners can use the vouchers from March 3 to 19, according to the announcement. In the last several years, mobile payment has replaced cash as the primary way consumers make purchases in China. Alibaba -affiliated Alipay app and Tencent's Wechat Pay are the main two apps for doing so in China. The People's Bank of China has been developing a digital currency that is expected to work similarly to the payment apps. Unlike well-known digital currencies like bitcoin , which are operated by a decentralized system, the central bank's version is controlled by a single power.
A Chinese court ruled in a divorce case that a wife should get about $7,700 from her husband in compensation for five years of housework. That's about $128 a month, or 10,000 yuan a year. China has said its poorest earned an average 9,808 yuan per person a year in 2019, up from 3,416 yuan in 2015.	BEIJING — A Chinese court ruled in a divorce case that a wife should get about 50,000 Chinese yuan ($7,700) from her husband in compensation for five years of housework. The ruling sparked an online debate this week about whether that was a fair price. That's about $128 a month, or a little more than $1,500 a year. In Chinese currency terms, the payout is about 10,000 yuan a year. China has said its poorest earned an average of 9,808 yuan per person a year in 2019. That figure is up from 3,416 yuan in 2015. In this case, brought up in Beijing's southwestern Fangshan district, the wife's household work counted toward intangible property value, Judge Feng Miao told state media, according to a report Monday. It was not immediately clear when the court ruling was made. But it was the first such decision that referenced new provisions in China's civil code that took effect in January.
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack believes China is making good on promises it made as part of the phase one trade deal. Vilsack said that the deal allows for changing market conditions, such as those caused by the Covid pandemic, to dictate how much Beijing is required to purchase. After months of negotiation and a tariff feud, China agreed in January 2020 to purchase an additional $200 billion in U.S. goods over two years.	Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack believes China is making good on promises it made as part of the landmark phase one trade deal it signed with the U.S. last year. Vilsack said that the deal allows for market conditions to dictate how much Beijing is required to purchase from U.S. farmers. The Covid pandemic , he added, would qualify as a material market condition that would impact how much China has to buy. "The good news is – China seems to be living up to its responsibilities," he said Wednesday. "The bad news is: At any point in time, because of the complex nature of the China-U.S. relationship, things can happen that might affect those purchases." After months of tense negotiation and a tit-for-tat tariff feud, China and the Trump administration struck a deal in January 2020 that Beijing would purchase an additional $200 billion in U.S. goods over two years. The additional purchases are supposed to be in addition to the quantity of goods and services Beijing bought from the U.S. in 2017. Specifically, China agreed to purchase $12.5 billion worth of agricultural goods in 2020, followed by an additional $19.5 billion in 2021. The country's purchases of U.S. soybeans and pork became of central importance during the bilateral talks throughout 2018 and 2019. Still, some reports note that China hasn't purchased the sums it promised before the Covid-19 pandemic, even if the rules of the trade deal allow for changes to the purchase amounts based market conditions. In its first year of implementation, China imported $100 billion of the U.S. goods agreed to in the deal — roughly 58% of the targeted $173.1 billion for 2020, according to Chinese customs data compiled by think tank Peterson Institute for International Economics. Still, Vilsack remained upbeat on the progress made by China. "I think they still have a few days to be able to meet the phase one, year one goal," he said. "Whether they meet the exact amount I think is in question in part because of the pandemic." Vilsack, who assumed office Wednesday, also served as Agriculture secretary under former President Barack Obama and was previously governor of Iowa. His renomination by President Joe Biden was easily approved in the Senate, which voted 92 to 7 on Tuesday to confirm the former dairy industry executive for a second term. Earlier this month, Vilsack was grilled by the Senate Agriculture Committee on his views on U.S. trade policy and climate change. He pledged to use funds included in the Commodity Credit Corporation to seek to capture atmospheric carbon. Vilsack is expected to attempt to tackle several challenges in the world of U.S. agriculture, including the pandemic-era rise in hunger, but a sharp drop in restaurant demand for food products. Civil rights groups have also raised concerns about his nomination, saying alleged discriminatory practices continued at the USDA under his prior tenure. —CNBC's Yen Nee Lee contributed to this report.
Li Auto said late Thursday it expected to deliver between 10,500 and 11,500 cars in the first quarter of the year, or fewer than 4,000 vehicles a month. Nio, which competes directly with Li Auto in the high-end SUV market, has delivered more than 7,000 units in both December and January. Li Auto's only vehicle, the Li One, is a hybrid electric vehicle that comes with a fuel tank for charging the battery.	BEIJING — Nasdaq-listed Chinese automaker Li Auto forecast deliveries below that of its competitors for the first quarter. Li Auto said late Thursday it expected to deliver between 10,500 and 11,500 cars in the first quarter of the year, or fewer than 4,000 vehicles a month. Shares fell 9.8% in the New York trading session amid a broader market sell-off. The stock shed another 3.75% in after-hours trade. Nio , which competes directly with Li Auto in the high-end SUV market, has delivered more than 7,000 units in both December and January. The company is set to share its latest financial report on Monday. Xpeng delivered 5,700 cars in December and more than 6,000 in January. Although the start-ups' figures point to rapid growth, they still pale in comparison with Tesla . Elon Musk's electric car company delivered nearly half a million vehicles worldwide last year, or an average of more than 41,000 cars a month. Even with the Lunar New Year holiday that fell in mid-February this year, Li Auto's weak guidance is concerning, said Tu Le, founder of Beijing-based advisory firm Sino Auto Insights. He pointed out that versus the other start-ups, the company only has one product, and said to keep up it should deliver at least 5,000 to 7,000 vehicles a month. Li Auto's only vehicle, the Li One, is a hybrid electric vehicle that comes with a fuel tank for charging the battery. Analysts have said the feature makes the Li One attractive for Chinese consumers worried about running out of power without access to a charging station. Last year, the Li One ranked among the top 10 high-end SUVs sold in China regardless of fuel type, according to the passenger car association. However, the company said deliveries fell to 5,379 units in January, down from 6,126 a month earlier. The company reported total revenue of 4.15 billion yuan ($635.5 million) for the fourth quarter, up from 2.51 billion yuan in the prior quarter. Li Auto projects total revenue in the first three months of this year to fall within the performance of the last two quarters, with an expected range of 2.94 billion yuan to 3.22 billion yuan.
China's decades-old one-child policy drew renewed attention late last month after authorities gave mixed signals on whether they were closer to repealing limits on how many children people can have. "In general I don't think the relaxing of the birth policy could have much of an economic impact because the slow growth in population hasn't been because of policy restriction, not for the last 20 years," said Dan Wang, Shanghai-based chief economist at Hang Seng China. Instead, economists expect more investment in factory automation and development of retirement and health care-related industries.	BEIJING —  China's decades-old one-child policy gained renewed attention in the last few weeks, after authorities gave mixed signals on whether they were closer to abolishing limits on how many children people can have. Authorities have rolled back the controversial one-child policy in recent years to allow people to have two children. But economists say other changes are needed for boosting growth as births fall and China's population rapidly ages. "There are two ways to address this. One way is to relax the birth control, something (that) will help on the margin, but even if they fully relax the control (it's) probably difficult to reverse the trend," said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. "The other way to deal with it, from an economic policy perspective, is to make industry more dependent on other sectors," he said. China's economy has relied heavily on industries such as manufacturing that require large amounts of cheap labor. But rising wages are making Chinese factories less attractive, while workers will need higher skills to help the country become more innovative. The bigger problem for China is that an aging population feeds into an existing issue: slower growth in labor productivity, said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, Natixis' chief economist for Asia-Pacific. She's watching to see whether China will see more growth in capital-intensive sectors, which is driven more by investment in automation. China introduced its one-child policy in the late 1970s in an effort to slow a surge in its population. The country had doubled in size from more than 500 million people in the 1940s to over 1 billion by the 1980s, according to official figures. Over the next 40 years, the population grew by only 40% — to 1.4 billion, more than four times that of the U.S. today. Similar to other major economies, high housing and educational costs in China have deterred people from having children in recent years. Despite a change in 2016 allowing families to have two children, births dropped for a fourth-straight year in 2020, and fell by 15% to 10 million, according to analysis of a public security report . "In general, I don't think the relaxing of the birth policy could have much of an economic impact because the slow growth in population hasn't been because of policy restriction, not for the last 20 years," said Dan Wang, Shanghai-based chief economist at Hang Seng China. She said based on the experience of other countries, the most effective policy for a country of China's size would be to welcome more migrants, but that would be an unlikely change in the near term. Other options policymakers are already pursuing include raising the retirement age, increasing the skills of the existing labor force with more education and using more machines and artificial intelligence to replace human workers, Wang said. The one-child policy gained renewed attention last month when the National Health Commission made public a statement authorizing research into the economic benefits of removing birth restrictions in a northeastern region. The three-province area, known as Dongbei, has struggled economically and has the lowest birth rates in the country. Two days later, the commission issued another statement saying the news was not a test for full repeal of the family planning policy, despite much online speculation that it was. But a removal of limits is likely only a matter of time, according to economists interviewed by CNBC. Yi Fuxian, a critic of the one-child policy and author of the book "Big Country With an Empty Nest," said he expects a decision at the end of the year, after China releases once-in-a-decade census results in April. The Chinese government has also said that implementing a strategy for responding to an aging population will be a priority for its next five-year plan, to be officially approved at a parliamentary session that kicks off this week. Meanwhile, the generations born before the one-child policy was implemented in the 1980s are becoming a significant segment. In the next 10 years, 123.9 million more people will enter the age category of 55 and above, the largest demographic increase among all age ranges, according to Morgan Stanley. This demographic shift will create its own economic demands, said Liu Xiangdong, deputy director of the economic research department at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges based in Beijing. Liu said more workers will be needed to care for the elderly, while retirement communities and other infrastructure tailored to an older population will see greater demand.
China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology declined Monday to name targets for semiconductor production. Chinese authorities had previously announced that by 2020, it would like to produce 40% of the chips it uses, and raise that ratio to 70% by 2025. The lack of new specific production goals comes as the world faces a global chip shortage and the U.S. has sanctioned China's largest chip manufacturer.	BEIJING — In the face of a global chip shortage and U.S. sanctions, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology declined Monday to name targets for semiconductor production. China would like to build up self-sufficiency in competitive technologies and rely less on imports of semiconductors, or chips, which are used in products ranging from laptops to automobiles. The country had previously announced that by 2020, it would like to produce 40% of the chips it uses, and raise that ratio to 70% by 2025. But when asked at a press conference Monday about chip production goals, the ministry's spokesperson Tian Yulong did not share specific figures. Instead, he laid out how the government was supporting the industry with measures such as tax cuts and talent development. "The semiconductor industry's development faces opportunities and challenges that require the world to strengthen cooperation and build the semiconductor industrial chain together, to allow it to develop in a healthier and more sustainable way," Tian said, according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks. His comments come as a global shortage in chips is forcing major automobile manufacturers to cut back on production. The backlog in semiconductor manufacturing grew out of high demand for electronics amid the coronavirus pandemic, and a highly specialized global supply chain that has faced additional pressure from the U.S.-China trade tensions that began under former President Donald Trump. Last year, the Trump administration put restrictions on China's biggest chip manufacturer, SMIC, that prevent it from buying high-end equipment needed for production. It's not yet clear what specific action U.S. President Joe Biden will take. Last week, he signed an executive order to review supply chains in an effort to address the shortage. Meanwhile, China's industry and technology ministry is trying to improve supply chain coordination in the country's automobile industry, where 90% of chips used are imported, according to a state media report Friday . During Monday's press conference, ministry head Xiao Yaqing said ensuring supply chain resiliency is a priority. "We must put improving the stability and competitiveness of industrial chains and supply chains in a position of prominence ... and firmly seize the initiative in the fiercely competitive international market," Xiao said. Nationwide, data indicate China did not meet its goal of 40% domestic sourcing in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. Only 15.9% of the $143.4 billion worth of integrated circuits — another name for semiconductors — sold in China last year were produced in the country, according to U.S.-based market research firm IC Insights.  China's leaders are set to kick off an annual parliamentary meeting this week to determine national development goals for the next five years and beyond. — CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.
Berkshire Hathaway holds an 8.2% stake in Chinese electric automaker BYD, more than it does of General Motors, U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett said in a letter to shareholders. Hong Kong-listed BYD was the conglomerate's eighth-largest holding by market value as of Dec. 31, the letter showed. Shares of BYD are up more than 300% over the last 12 months. Those of GM have climbed 65% during the same time period.	BEIJING — Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate has a larger stake in Chinese electric automaker BYD than it does of General Motors , according to a letter to shareholders . Berkshire Hathaway holds an 8.2% stake in Hong-Kong listed BYD and is the company's eighth-largest holding by market value as of Dec. 31, according to the letter which was released on Saturday. In contrast, the firm held 3.7% of General Motors, the 15th-largest holding. Shares of BYD are up more than 300% over the last 12 months. Those of GM have climbed 65% during the same time period. A Berkshire Hathaway unit first invested in battery and electric car company BYD in 2008. The Shenzhen-based company has become a major automaker in the world's largest car market, and sold more than 130,000 pure-electric passenger cars last year. That's far more than start-up electric car rivals like Nio , which delivered just over 43,700 cars last year. In January, GM became the latest traditional automaker to accelerate its push into electric vehicles by announcing a goal to end production of all diesel- and gasoline-powered cars, trucks and SUVs by 2035. That follows the American car maker's announcement in November that it would increase spending by $7 billion on electric car development. The plan's new total of $27 billion will go toward the scheduled release of 30 new electric vehicles worldwide. — CNBC's Michael Wayland contributed to this report.
Beijing is reportedly considering changes to Hong Kong's electoral system that could prevent pro-democracy politicians from running in local elections. John Marrett, senior analyst at risk consultancy The Economist Intelligence Unit, said Beijing has already made several moves to hold back opposition in Hong Kong. "It does say something about their fears of a later resurgence of political instability, social unrest in the city and it does speak to their lack of concern for international outcry over Hong Kong anymore," he said.	China's central government might be willing to ignore international outcry over its crackdown on Hong Kong as it reportedly weighs further actions to tighten its grip on the city, one analyst told CNBC on Monday. Last week, media outlets including Reuters and South China Morning Post reported that Beijing could be considering changes to Hong Kong's electoral system that could limit pro-democracy politicians and prevent them from running in local elections. The reports came as Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of China's State Council, said in a Mandarin-language statement translated by CNBC that "legal loopholes" in Hong Kong's electoral system should be closed so that the city is governed only by "patriots." Xia said one of the reasons Hong Kong saw an anti-China movement was because the city's important institutions were not fully helmed by "patriots." John Marrett, senior analyst at risk consultancy The Economist Intelligence Unit, said Beijing has already made several moves to hold back opposition in Hong Kong. "It is notable that they're going much further in proposing these electoral reforms, the details of which we have yet to see," he told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia " on Monday. "But it does say something about their fears of a later resurgence of political instability, social unrest in the city and it does speak to their lack of concern for international outcry over Hong Kong anymore," he added. Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The city is governed under a "one country, two systems" principle that gives it greater autonomy than other mainland Chinese cities, including limited election rights. The Hong Kong government has barred at least 12 pro-democracy candidates from running in the city's legislative election — which was postponed for one year until September 2021 . The government cited the pandemic as the reason for the delay. In addition, four opposition lawmakers were dismissed from Hong Kong's Legislative Council in November last year — leading others to resign in protest, reported Reuters. Beijing was criticized by several countries — including the U.S. and the U.K. — for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy when it enacted a national security law in the former British colony last year. The law was implemented on June 30 last year , after months of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong that sometimes turned violent. According to a Reuters report citing Hong Kong police, 99 individuals have been arrested so far for suspected violations of the national security law. Over the weekend, 47 pro-democracy campaigners and activists were charged under the law, the news agency reported. Marrett said Beijing might be trying to "completely eradiate" dissent from Hong Kong. "They've gone further than most people could have imagined and there's no sign of them stopping anytime soon," he said.
Chinese electric car start-up Nio said Tuesday a shortage in semiconductors and batteries will cut its production capacity in the second quarter to 7,500 vehicles a month, down from 10,000. Despite the Lunar New Year holiday last month, Nio delivered more than two times more electric cars in China than fellow start-up Xpeng did. Shares of New York-listed Nio fell 4% in extended-hours trading after reporting a fourth-quarter earnings loss of 0.93 yuan (14 cents) a share.	BEIJING — Chinese electric car start-up Nio said Tuesday a global chip shortage will force it to manufacture fewer cars in the second quarter. High demand for electronics amid the coronavirus pandemic and pressure from U.S.-China trade tensions on the highly specialized semiconductor supply chain have contributed to a backlog in chip manufacturing. Major automakers have had to cut production as a result, with China-based Nio the latest to announce such reductions. The company had ramped up production capacity in February to 10,000 vehicles a month, an increase from 7,500 previously, founder William Li said in a quarterly earnings call Tuesday. But a shortage in chips and batteries means Nio will need to fall back to the 7,500 level in the second quarter, he said. Li said he expects manufacturing can increase again in July, for a total annual production capacity of 150,000 vehicles under one work shift — with the potential to double by early 2022 to 300,000 units a year under two shifts. Tesla said late last year that annual production capacity at its Shanghai factory had reached 250,000 units. Despite competition from Tesla, Nio remained ahead of its start-up rivals in terms of vehicle sales. The company delivered 7,225 vehicles in January and 5,578 in February amid the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. With a forecast of 20,000 to 25,000 deliveries in the first quarter, Nio anticipates deliveries will rise to at least 7,197 cars in March. In contrast, Xpeng said Tuesday it delivered 2,223 electric cars last month, while Li Auto expects it will deliver fewer than 4,000 cars a month in the first quarter. Nio founder Li said that pre-orders for the et7 sedan revealed in January have exceeded that of the company's other models, but declined to share specific figures. The et7 is Nio's first non-SUV consumer car and is set to begin deliveries next year. Li added the company remained on track with plans to enter Europe later this year. Shares of New York-listed Nio fell 4% in extended-hours trading after reporting a fourth-quarter earnings loss of 0.93 yuan (14 cents) a share. That's greater than the 0.39 yuan loss per share predicted by analysts, according to FactSet. The company attributed a nearly 33% quarterly increase in net losses — to 1.39 billion yuan ($212.8 million) in the last three months of 2020 — primarily to the depreciation in the U.S. dollar. Nio shares soared more than 1,000% last year after the struggling start-up received a roughly $1 billion capital injection from state-backed investors, and traders piled into the stock alongside a surge in Tesla's shares. Looking ahead, Nio expects total revenue of 7.38 billion yuan to 7.56 billion yuan in the first quarter, up from 6.64 billion yuan in the fourth quarter.
President Joe Biden's administration will use "all available tools" to fight China's unfair trade practices, said a report released by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The report outlined the new U.S. administration's trade agenda, including how it will address challenges posed by China. The release of the report comes as Katherine Tai, Biden's nominee for U.S. Trade Representative, awaits Senate confirmation.	President Joe Biden's team will use "all available tools" to fight China's unfair trade practices, according to a report outlining the new U.S. administration's trade agenda . The document released on Monday did not specify the tools that the administration will use, but it formalized statements made by Biden and members of his team in the last few months on how they will handle China and other trade priorities. "Addressing the China challenge will require a comprehensive strategy and more systematic approach than the piecemeal approach of the recent past," read the report. "The Biden Administration is conducting a comprehensive review of U.S. trade policy toward China as part of its development of its overall China strategy," it added. The report outlined a few "detrimental actions" from China, such as barriers to restrict market access, "government-sanctioned forced labor programs" as well as unfair subsidies. "They also include coercive technology transfers, illicit acquisition and infringement of American intellectual property, censorship and other restrictions on the internet and digital economy, and a failure to provide treatment to American firms in numerous sectors comparable to the treatment Chinese firms receive in those sectors in the United States," the report said. Biden's administration will cooperate with partners and allies to make sure that China lives up to its trade obligations, the report said. The administration will also make it "a top priority" to address China's alleged forced labor programs that target Uighur Muslims and other minority groups, said the report. The release of the report comes as Katherine Tai, Biden's nominee for U.S. Trade Representative, awaits Senate confirmation. Tai said on Monday she would work to address a range of issues concerning Chinese trade and economic practices — including intellectual property protection, market access restrictions and censorship, reported Reuters. She said she would explore "a wide range of options" to address those problems, including through bilateral talks but "will not hesitate to act if those talks prove ineffective," the news agency reports. Tai made those comments in written answers to senators' questions following her confirmation hearing last week. If confirmed, Tai will inherit a long list of unresolved trade and tariff disputes from former President Donald Trump's administration. The list includes elevated tariffs that the U.S. and China slapped on each other's goods during Trump's term, as well as China's lagging purchases of U.S. goods under the "phase one" trade deal. During her confirmation hearing last week, Tai said tariffs are a "legitimate tool" to counter China's state-driven economic model, reported Reuters. But she did not threaten new tariffs, and said China needs to live up to its commitments under the phase one deal, the news agency reported. The trade pact signed by the U.S. and China last year put a pause to a tariff fight that threatened the global economy. Among other things, the deal requires China to buy $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services on top of its 2017 purchases. China has so far failed to buy the required amounts of American goods stipulated by the trade agreement, data compiled by think tank Peterson Institute of International Economics showed.
The National Security Commission on AI believes that China could soon replace the U.S. as the world's "AI superpower" and said there are serious military implications to consider. In a report, it warned that AI systems will be used in the "pursuit of power" and that "AI will not stay in the domain of superpowers or the realm of science fiction." It also urges President Biden to reject calls for a global ban on highly controversial AI-powered autonomous weapons, saying that China and Russia are unlikely to keep to any treaty they sign.	The U.S. is drastically underprepared for the age of artificial intelligence, according to a group of experts chaired by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The National Security Commission on AI warned in a 756-page report on Monday that China could soon replace the U.S. as the world's "AI superpower" and said there are serious military implications to consider. "America is not prepared to defend or compete in the AI era," wrote Schmidt and vice chair Bob Work, who was previously deputy U.S. secretary of Defense. "This is the tough reality we must face." The commission began its review in March 2019, and this is its final report for the president and Congress. The 15 members of the commission include technologists, national security professionals, business executives and academic leaders. Among them are Amazon 's next CEO, Andy Jassy, Oracle CEO Safra Catz, Microsoft Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz and Google Cloud AI chief Andrew Moore. Schmidt and Work said the report presents a "strategy to defend against AI threats, responsibly employ AI for national security, and win the broader technology competition for the sake of our prosperity, security, and welfare." They warn that AI systems will be used in the "pursuit of power" and that "AI will not stay in the domain of superpowers or the realm of science fiction." The report urges President Joe Biden to reject calls for a global ban on highly controversial AI-powered autonomous weapons, saying that China and Russia are unlikely to keep to any treaty they sign. "We will not be able to defend against AI-enabled threats without ubiquitous AI capabilities and new warfighting paradigms," Schmidt and Work wrote. Thousands of AI researchers and computer scientists signed an open letter that was published in 2015 and calls for a ban on offensive autonomous weapons. "AI technology has reached a point where the deployment of such systems is — practically if not legally — feasible within years, not decades, and the stakes are high: autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms," reads the letter, which was also signed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and the late scientist Stephen Hawking. Toby Walsh, a professor of AI at the University of Sydney, told CNBC the dangers have only "become nearer and more serious" since the letter was published. "Autonomous weapons must be regulated," he said. The Future of Life Institute, a non-profit research institute in Boston, Massachusetts, said last month there are many positive military applications for AI but "delegating life and death decisions to autonomous weapon systems is not one of them." The institute pointed out that autonomous drones could be used for reconnaissance missions to avoid putting troops in danger, while AI could also be used to power defensive anti-missile guns which detect, target, and destroy incoming threats without a human command. "Neither application involves a machine selecting and attacking humans without an operator's green light," it said. Machine learning engineer Michael Lavelle told CNBC that there needs to be an international ban on AI decision making weaponry, similar to the convention on chemical weapons. Samim Winiger, an AI researcher in Berlin, sees things differently, telling CNBC that AI weapons and killer robots will make today's weapons even more deadly. "[Adopting AI weapons] is brutal insanity and everyone knows it, yet think tank staffers from DC to Beijing keep assuring us it's 'progress and necessary.'" He added: "A real discussion around 'how AI can help to promote peace globally' is what is truly required — but you certainly won't find it on the agenda of Pentagon operatives or intelligence agency billionaires like the Eric Schmidts of the world." China has stated that it wants to be a global leader in AI by 2030. The report's authors have said it is vital that the U.S. does all it can to eliminate the chance of this happening. "We must win the AI competition that is intensifying strategic competition with China," said Schmidt and Work. "China's plans, resources, and progress should concern all Americans. We take seriously China's ambition to surpass the United States as the world's AI leader within a decade." They added that China's domestic use of AI is "a chilling precedent for anyone around the world who cherishes individual liberty." The commission calls on the U.S. government to more than double its AI research and development spending to $32 billion a year by 2026. It also suggests establishing a new body to help the president guide the U.S.' wider AI policies, relaxing immigration laws for talented AI experts, creating a new university to train digitally skilled civil servants, and accelerating the adoption of new technologies by U.S. intelligence agencies. The report also warns that the U.S. needs to do more to become self-reliant on computer chips and warns about the dangers of being so dependent on Taiwan's TSMC. "Microelectronics power all AI, and the United States no longer manufactures the world's most sophisticated chips," wrote Schmidt and Work. "Given that the vast majority of cutting-edge chips are produced at a single plant separated by just 110 miles of water from our principal strategic competitor, we must reevaluate the meaning of supply chain resilience and security."

The Chinese government's annual parliamentary meeting known as the "Two Sessions" is set to kick off this week in Beijing. The otherwise generally symbolic gathering takes on particular significance this year as it marks the beginning of China's five-year development plan — the 14th such in the country's history — and the 100th anniversary of the ruling Communist Party. Authorities are also set to lay out targets for this year's urban job creation, inflation and other growth measures.	BEIJING — The Chinese government is set to kick off an annual parliamentary meeting this week for approving national priorities for 2021. The gathering of delegates, known as the "Two Sessions," has overseen such changes as President Xi Jinping 's abolition of term limits in 2018 and the proposal for a new security law for Hong Kong last year. The otherwise generally symbolic meeting takes on particular significance this year as it marks the beginning of China's five-year development plan — the 14th such in the country's history — and the 100th anniversary of the ruling Communist Party. Authorities are expected to lay out details on topics ranging from employment targets to management of the semi-autonomous region of Hong Kong. Such comments will come as Beijing seeks to show progress on development promises made to the country of 1.4 billion people, and build up China's competitiveness in a world shocked by the coronavirus pandemic and growing wary of the Asian giant's rise. The "Two Sessions" parliamentary meeting is slated to begin Thursday with the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body. The National People's Congress legislature is scheduled to kick off its annual gathering on Friday. That's usually when the government releases its economic work report, a document laying out GDP, employment, inflation and other growth goals. Most economists do not expect authorities will release a GDP target this year, after making a rare decision not to do so at last year's parliamentary meeting, which was delayed by about two months due to the coronavirus pandemic. Li-Gang Liu, managing director and chief China economist at Citi Research, said in a note that if the report lays out a GDP target directly or indirectly, the figure could top 7%. That's according to growth goals announced by different Chinese provinces and a commitment to double GDP from its level in 2010, Liu said. On monetary policy, although authorities have emphasized they will not abruptly reverse stimulus policies , "we expect China's monetary policy conditions will visibly tighten this year," Liu added. China's economy grew by 2.3% last year , despite the shock of the coronavirus pandemic, as authorities rushed to control the domestic spread of the virus and support businesses with tax cuts and cheaper loans. That GDP growth followed expansion of 6.0% in 2019, according to official figures. On employment, economists generally anticipate China will aim to create more than 10 million new urban jobs this year, up from 9 million last year. The parliamentary meeting will also share details on and approve China's 14th five-year plan. The development strategy for the world's second-largest economy comes as it has reached historic trade agreements with Asia-Pacific neighbors, while facing greater pressure from a United States that increasingly considers China a competitor. The plan's emphasis on "boosting domestic demand, supply chain upgrading, technology self-sufficiency and further opening up domestic markets are the main tools to hedge against external uncertainties," Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance, said in a report. In addition to specifics on how China might address national security issues on technology and energy, authorities are expected to lay out plans for defense spending in 2021. Details on how Beijing plans to strengthen control of Hong Kong could also emerge from this year's parliamentary session. Late last month, Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference — the political advisory body meeting during "Two Sessions" — released a speech on how Hong Kong's electoral system should be changed so that only central government supporters would oversee the semi-autonomous region. The parliamentary meeting is expected to last around 10 days and include press conferences with Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Premier Li Keqiang.
CNBC spoke to Chinese consumers who bought local electric cars instead of Tesla and found out what drove their purchase decisions: price and driving range. Here are some anecdotes on why Chinese consumers bought electric cars from Tesla competitors Nio, Li Auto and Xpeng. Local government policy support for license plates and charging infrastructure is another factor.	BEIJING — Chinese consumers thinking about whether to buy Tesla 's electric cars or local alternatives have two things at the top of their minds: price and driving range. That's according to anecdotes gathered by CNBC — conversations from around the country that do not represent qualitative research. But the comments shed light on what some consumers care about in China, the world's largest auto market. U.S.-listed Chinese car start-ups Nio , Xpeng and Li Auto saw deliveries surge last year despite a slump in the overall auto market and the coronavirus pandemic. Shares of the companies soared in 2020, but pulled back slightly this year. To be clear, Tesla is still the market leader for high-end electric vehicles in China. During a quick check at the start of the evening commute one day, CNBC found 11 Tesla cars passing by, along with two Nio SUVs, one from WM Motor and Xpeng's latest P7 sedan . Here's what some Chinese consumers say factored into their decision to buy a local electric car. First, price was a major consideration. Chen Yingjie, 42, said he bought Li Auto's Li One SUV in April 2020 for about 300,000 yuan ($46,000) after realizing it would cost him about twice as much to buy a similar car from Nio with all the specifications he wanted. Nio's starting price is low, but there are many features that come at an additional cost, Chen said. The Shanghai resident had previously bought Xpeng's G3 in 2019, and later a BYD electric car for his father in June 2020. Part of Nio's strategy is selling many car features via a subscription model. For example, the company launched a "battery as a service" plan last year that charges customers a monthly fee for battery power — similar to a regular fuel charge for a traditional gas-powered car. For Wang Jingyan, 29, he said Nio's emphasis on customer care services was something he thought was worth paying extra for because it saved him time from going to a repair shop. Price was also a factor for him. Wang said he bought his Nio ES6 for about 450,000 yuan in late 2019 — his first electric car — after a recommendation from a manager at work and comparing it with a more expensive Lexus RX. He said he didn't have a chance to try out Tesla's Model 3 beforehand, but he didn't have that good of an impression based on his friends' experience and online stories about poor customer service at stores. How far the car could drive on a single battery charge was another important factor for Chinese consumers. Zhang Zhen, 41, lives in a cold part of northern China and was concerned about an electric car's ability to have enough power to complete a driving trip while heating the vehicle. So last fall, his family bought a Li One, which comes with a fuel tank for charging the battery. That fuel boosts Li One's driving range from 180 kilometers (111 miles) to 800 kilometers (497 miles) on a single charge. Zhang said his wife primarily uses the car to send and pick up their children from school, a daily distance of about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). The children also prefer his wife's car to his non-electric car because they can watch cartoons on the vehicle's built-in interior screen, Zhang said. But he's found repairs more of a hassle than for a non-electric car, and said he wouldn't consider buying another such vehicle in China's northeastern region due to the lack of public charging infrastructure there. In an effort to support the local development of electric vehicles, the Chinese government has launched subsidy programs and emphasized the build out of a national charging network. But compared with the U.S., the majority of cars in China do not have fixed parking spaces, making it difficult for many drivers to have regular access to battery charging stations, according to Mingming Huang, founding partner at Future Capital Discovery Fund, an investor in Li Auto. That's why he expects range extension systems like the start-up offers may be the best option for China in the next five to 10 years. Li Auto's Li One SUV comes with a fuel tank for charging the battery on the go. Finally, many Chinese drivers are choosing electric cars because of favorable government policy, such as programs that make it far quicker and cheaper to get license plates for the electric vehicles. Due to efforts to reduce congestion and pollution in Chinese cities, locals often need to wait years to buy expensive license plates for fuel-powered cars. After waiting almost a year in Hangzhou city for a fuel-powered car license plate, a 27-year-old, who requested anonymity, decided not to wait any longer after seeing an Xpeng G3 electric car during a shopping mall trip. The car fit her budget at about 180,000 yuan, after government subsidies, she said. On the streets of Beijing, where license plates are also difficult to get, the higher-end electric car maker Tesla is still a popular choice.
China's sudden ban on Taiwanese pineapples does not meet the standards of international trade rules, Wang Mei-Hua, Taiwan's minister of economic affairs told CNBC this week. Beijing on Friday announced that it would temporarily stop imports of the tropical fruit from the island from March 1. Taiwan sees the ban as a political move, but China says it made the decision for biosecurity reasons.	China's sudden ban on Taiwanese pineapples fails to meet the standards of international trade rules, Taiwan's minister of economic affairs Wang Mei-Hua told CNBC. Beijing on Friday announced that it would temporarily stop imports of the tropical fruit from the island from March 1, according to Reuters. Chinese state media Xinhua reported that the ban was put in place because Chinese customs officials found pests in pineapples imported from Taiwan. A spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council — an administrative agency under China — said the pests posed a serious threat to China's agriculture and ecological security if not intercepted, according to Xinhua. Separately, Beijing has defended the move and maintained that the ban on pineapples is reasonable and necessary for biosecurity reasons, Xinhua reported. Most of Taiwan's pineapples are consumed domestically, according to Reuters . However, of those exported, 90% of them were sold to China last year. "All of a sudden, China notified us about the pineapple pests and immediately banned imports of our products. We believe that it does not comply with international trade rules," Wang told CNBC's Emily Tan on Wednesday. "But we will try our best to reflect and discuss with China on this issue. Meanwhile, we will try to diversify and sell our great products to other markets beyond China," she said, according to a translation of her comments in Mandarin. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has rallied support for local pineapple farmers on Facebook, and encouraged people to eat more of the fruit. The island's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said China is using the ban to put economic pressure on Taiwan, Reuters reported . The Chinese Communist Party has never ruled Taiwan, but sees the self-governing island as a renegade province. "This is not the first time China has used agricultural exports to other countries as political threats," the DPP said in a statement, Reuters reported. Diplomats from the U.S. and Canada have also shown support for Taiwan and its pineapples. The two countries do not have formal diplomatic relations with the island, but enjoy close ties. Canada's trade office in Taipei posted a photo on its Facebook account of its staff posing with pineapples and pizza. The post included the hashtag #FreedomPineapples. Separately, the American Institute in Taiwan used the hashtag #pineapplesolidarity and shared pictures of the tropical fruit in offices and bookshelves. It has also posted recipes that use pineapples. Last week, a bill introduced in the House of Representatives called for the U.S. to resume diplomatic ties with Taiwan, negotiate a free trade agreement (FTA) and support the island's membership in international organizations. Wang, Taiwan's minister of economic affairs, said Washington and Taipei have "long-standing" relations both economically and strategically. They also have strong cooperation in the semiconductor industry, she said. "If, in the future, we could have an FTA, we would definitely welcome and pursue it because it would further strengthen our economic ties," she added.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced Friday the world's second-largest economy would target growth of over 6% for 2021. The premier struck an overall positive tone on China's economic recovery from the pandemic, while noting areas of weakness such as "impediments" to consumer spending. Li also discussed hopes for China's relationship with the U.S. and other international trade deals.	BEIJING — China has set growth target of over 6% for 2021, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced Friday at an annual parliamentary meeting — the country's most important political event of the year. Such growth would come off a low base. China reported GDP growth of 2.3% last year — the only major economy to expand amid the coronavirus pandemic. The country's official economic figures are often doubted for their accuracy. Li announced the growth target in a government work report delivered at the opening ceremony of the National People's Congress. The meeting is part of Beijing's "Two Sessions" annual parliamentary gathering which sets economic and political national priorities for 2021. The premier struck an overall positive tone on China's economic recovery from the pandemic, while noting areas of weakness such as "impediments" to consumer spending, tough conditions for small businesses and mounting pressure in maintaining stable employment. For 2021, Li said China aimed for an urban unemployment rate of around 5.5% and targeted the creation of more than 11 million new urban jobs, the same as in 2019 and up from 9 million last year. China will also aim for an increase of around 3% in the consumer price index, a measure of inflation, Li said. Strengthening science and technology development was among major tasks for the year, Li said. He noted that "in forestalling and defusing risks in the financial sector and other areas, we face formidable tasks." On international trade, Li said the country would "promote the growth of mutually beneficial China-US business relations on the basis of equality and mutual respect." He did not elaborate further, but said China will work to accelerate free trade negotiations with Japan and South Korea, and actively consider joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. The CPTPP trade deal was previously known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from immediately upon inauguration in 2017. It's not yet clear whether President Joe Biden 's administration will push for the U.S. to rejoin the deal. Tensions that escalated between China and the U.S. in the last few years have shifted from just trade into areas such as technology and controversy over the origins of Covid-19. In prepared remarks, Li said Friday there were still "weak links" in China's control of Covid-19, but that the economy had sufficiently recovered. Li said there are no plans for new bond issuance for combating the effects of the pandemic and that the deficit-to-GDP ratio would be around 3.2%, lower than last year's target of over 3.6%. He also repeated existing commitments to allowing more foreign investment in domestic industries. The Chinese premier said the country would "boost military training and preparedness" and improve defense-related technology. In a separate report Friday, China's Finance Ministry said spending on national defense would rise 6.8% to nearly 1.36 trillion yuan ($210.1 billion). That's slightly faster than last year's 6.6% increase. Li said the country would "resolutely deter" any separatist activity that seeks the independence of Taiwan while remaining committed to peaceful reunification with the region, which Beijing considers a breakaway province. He also said the central government will "improve the relevant systems and mechanisms" of the semi-autonomous regions of Hong Kong and Macao. One of the agenda items for this year's National People's Congress is to consider a draft for changing the electoral system of Hong Kong. Top officials have spoken publicly in the last few weeks about how Hong Kong's electoral system should be changed so that only central government supporters would oversee the semi-autonomous region. The annual Two Sessions meeting has  overseen changes such as President Xi Jinping 's abolition of term limits in 2018 and the proposal for a new security law for Hong Kong last year. The otherwise generally symbolic gathering takes on particular significance this year as it marks the beginning of China's five-year development plan — the 14th such plan in the country's history . It is also the 100th anniversary of the ruling Communist Party. The political advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, held its opening ceremony Thursday. The National People's Congress legislature began its annual gathering on Friday. The two meetings are set to wrap up late next week.
China's research and development spending will increase by more than 7% per year between 2021 and 2025, Premier Li Keqiang said. R&D will account for a higher percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) than in the previous 5 years. China is going to focus on developing a number of technology areas including semiconductors, health care, quantum computing and cloud computing, according to a draft of its five-year plan.	GUANGZHOU, China — China will increase its spending on research and development over the next five years in a push to make "major breakthroughs" in technology, Premier Li Keqiang said on Friday. The comments came during a speech at China's annual parliamentary "Two Sessions" meeting as Beijing lays out its priorities for the coming years. Tensions between the U.S. and China over the past few years have spilled over into the technology space hitting China's biggest companies like Huawei and hurting critical industries like semiconductors . China has tried to focus on boosting its domestic capabilities in a number of technological areas. Li said China's research and development spending will increase by more than 7% per year between 2021 and 2025. R&D will account for a higher percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) than in the previous 5 years. He did not give details on how much the government would spend in absolute terms. China's spending on R&D climbed 10.3% to 2.44 trillion Chinese yuan ($378 billion) and accounted for 2.4% of GDP in 2020, according to official statistics. Meanwhile, central government expenditures on basic research will increase by 10.6%, Li said. The Two Sessions this year marks the start of China's 14th five-year development plan which lays out priorities and goals over the coming years. The current plan runs from 2021 to 2025. In the past, the annual gathering of delegates has overseen major changes including President Xi Jinping 's abolition of term limits in 2018. In his report, Li laid out China's vision for the next five years. "To improve China's innovation system, we will work faster to enhance our strategic scientific and technological capability underpinned by the development of national laboratories, strive to make major breakthroughs in core technologies in key fields, and formulate and implement a ten-year action plan for basic research," he said. China is going to focus on developing a number of technology areas including semiconductors, health care, quantum computing and cloud computing, according to a draft of its five-year plan.
China on Friday proposed changes to Hong Kong's electoral system which would hold back the city's pro-democracy politicians. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said in his work report that China will "resolutely guard against and deter external forces' interference" in Hong Kong's affairs. The proposed changes include adjusting the size, composition and formation of Hong Kong's election committee, which selects the city's leader or chief executive, said state media Xinhua.	Beijing on Friday proposed changes to "improve" Hong Kong's electoral system — a widely anticipated move as China tightened its hold on the semi-autonomous region. Before the proposal was announced, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said at the start of China's annual "Two Sessions" parliamentary meeting that the country will "resolutely guard against and deter external forces' interference" in the city. The proposed changes include adjusting the size, composition and formation of Hong Kong's election committee, which selects the city's leader or chief executive, said state media Xinhua. Beijing also wants to expand the committee's function to include electing a "relatively large share" of Hong Kong's legislative body, and nominating candidates for the body, said Xinhua. Last week, media outlets including Reuters reported that potential changes to Hong Kong's electoral system would hold back Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians. Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The city is governed under a "one country, two systems" principle that gives it greater autonomy than other mainland Chinese cities, including limited election rights. Beijing has been criticized internationally — by countries including the U.S. and the U.K. — for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy that was promised under the "one country, two systems" framework. Proposed changes to Hong Kong's electoral system came about a year after China bypassed the city's legislation to enact a controversial national security law . Implementation of the law followed months of pro-democracy protests in the city that sometimes turned violent. Chinese officials and state media had often said "external forces" were behind the Hong Kong protests. Wang Chen, vice chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said on Friday that "rioting and turbulence" in Hong Kong point to "clear loopholes and deficiencies" in the electoral system, reported Xinhua. The National People's Congress (NPC) is China's top legislature. Chen added that changes must be made so that Hong Kong is governed only by "patriots," according to the report. Witman Hung, a Hong Kong deputy to the 13th NPC, told CNBC's "Capital Connection" that China always assumed that "Hong Kong people who are patriots" will lead the city. The Chinese leadership was confident in them running Hong Kong, he added. "Nobody was questioning it until recently," he said on Friday. "What we found is that maybe the assumption wasn't … true." He said the violent riots as well as "subversion and secession plans" were "beyond imagination" 20 years ago. He also defended China's right to make changes in Hong Kong, noting that the city's legal framework and basic law were enacted by the NPC. "If you look at that from a jurisprudence point of view, I mean this is perfectly legal and in line," he said. — CNBC's Abigail Ng contributed to this report.
Chinese economists are concerned about spillover risks from massive U.S. stimulus aimed at battling the coronavirus pandemic. Worries over "imported inflation" come as China considers how to manage growth in an economy recovering from Covid-19, while still dealing with problems of high debt levels and a housing bubble.	BEIJING — As the U.S. pumps trillions of dollars into its economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, economists are concerned about spillover effects in China, including the risk of "imported inflation." Worries about high inflation, or rapidly rising prices, hit U.S. markets last week. The U.S. Congress is reviewing a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan that critics say could cause inflation to soar, and add to debt levels that rose following last year's historic $2 trillion stimulus package. In China, economists are wary of risks to growth as the country tries to recover fully from the shock of the pandemic. "The large-scale issuance of U.S. Treasurys, and the rapid expansion of the Federal Reserve (balance sheet), have increased the spillover effect of U.S. macro policies," former finance minister Lou Jiwei said in an article published in the latest issue of the government-affiliated journal "Public Finance Research." That's according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese text. Lou said the effects from major countries' policies will hit emerging countries economically and financially. "We are facing major changes not seen for a century," he said. Lou is also the head of the foreign affairs committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference — the political advisory body meeting during the annual "Two Sessions" parliamentary gathering that began this week. As part of the parliamentary meeting, Premier Li Keqiang announced Friday a growth target of over 6% for 2021, and said the government would keep monetary policy "at a reasonable and appropriate level." Analysts are watching the week-long meeting for any details on how leaders might alter China's monetary policy given the economy's overall recovery from the shock of Covid-19. Covid-19 first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. Stringent lockdowns in China allowed the country to control the domestic outbreak within months, but not before the pandemic spread throughout the world. The coronavirus has hit the U.S. the hardest with more than 28.8 million cases and 520,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. and Europe have pursued extraordinary monetary policy in the last two years, said Zhang Cheng, director of credit at Bluestone Asset Management, referring to historically low interest rates and other policies to support economic growth. That's caused a rise in commodity prices and pressure from "imported inflation" in China, he said, according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks. Zhang added that China should protect itself from risks by avoiding U.S. dollar-denominated assets. The country is the world's second-largest holder of U.S. Treasurys and has $3.2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, mostly denominated in the U.S. dollar. When moving toward tighter policy, Chinese monetary policy will need to consider external risks, such as the potential for "imported inflation" and the long-run depreciation of the U.S. dollar as a result of stimulus in the U.S., JD Digits economists Shen Jianguang and Zhang Mingming wrote in a commentary piece carried by a state news agency last week. Such a decline in the greenback would affect the security of China's foreign exchange reserves, making efforts to increase international use of the yuan more important, the authors said. As for near-term inflation concerns, analysts are watching the surge in prices for many commodities, of which China is the world's largest consumer. Last month, copper prices rose to their highest since 2011. These price increases would raise production costs in China. But analysts like Ma Yan, who covers foreign exchange at Hangzhou-based brokerage Nanhua Futures, expect the impact from such imported inflation will ultimately not be that great. Instead, Ma is more concerned about how China can control its housing bubble, and is monitoring the credit and liquidity risk of real estate companies.
China is looking to boost research into what it calls "frontier technology" as it competes with the U.S. for supremacy in the latest innovations. In its 14th five-year plan, China laid out seven technology areas it will focus research on including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, semiconductors and space. Premier Li Keqiang said on Friday that China would increase research and development spending by more than 7% per year between 2021 and 2025, in pursuit of "major breakthroughs" in technology.	GUANGZHOU, China — China is looking to boost research into what it calls "frontier technology" including quantum computing and semiconductors, as it competes with the U.S. for supremacy in the latest innovations. In its five-year development plan, the 14th of its kind , Beijing said it would make "science and technology self-reliance and self-improvement a strategic pillar for national development," according to a CNBC translation. Premier Li Keqiang said on Friday that China would increase research and development spending by more than 7% per year between 2021 and 2025 , in pursuit of "major breakthroughs" in technology. China's technology champions such as Huawei and SMIC have been targeted by U.S. sanctions as tensions between Beijing and Washington have ramped up in the past few years . As such, China has concentrated on boosting its domestic expertise in areas it sees as strategically important, such as semiconductors. And now it has laid out seven "frontier technologies" that it will prioritize not just for the next five years, but beyond too. China plans to focus on specialized chip development for AI applications and developing so-called open source algorithms. Open source technology is usually developed by one entity and licensed by other companies. There will also be an emphasis on machine learning in areas such as decision making. Machine learning is the development of AI programs trained on vast amounts of data. The program "learns" as it is fed more data. AI has been a key field for Chinese companies and the central government over the last few years. Major companies such as Alibaba and Baidu have been investing in the technology. China and the U.S. are competing for AI dominance. A group of experts chaired by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said China could soon replace the U.S. as the world's "AI superpower." This is category of technology involves quantum computing. This is a totally different concept from the computers we use today and holds the promise of being able to aid in ambitious feats such as the creation of new medicine. Quantum computing is seen as another area of competition between the U.S. and China. Semiconductors are a critical area for China and one it has invested a lot in over the past few years but the country has struggled to catch up to the U.S., Taiwan and South Korea . The problem is the complexity of the semiconductor supply chain. Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung are the two most advanced chip manufacturers but they rely on tools from the U.S. and Europe. Washington has put SMIC, China's biggest chip manufacturer, on an export blacklist called the Entity List . SMIC cannot get its hands on American technology. And the U.S. has reportedly pushed to stop Dutch company ASML from shipping a key tool that could help SMIC catch up to rivals. Since China doesn't have the companies that can design and make the tools that its chip manufacturers require, it relies on companies from other countries. This is something China wants to change. In its five-year plan, China says it will focus on research and development in integrated circuit design tools, key equipment and key materials. Chips are incredibly important because they go into many of the devices we use such as smartphones but are also important for other industries. China plans to research areas such as how to stop diseases of the brain. But it also says that it plans to look into "brain-inspired computing" as well as "brain-computer fusion technology," according to a CNBC translation. The five-year plan did not elaborate on what that could look like. However, such work is already underway in the U.S. at Elon Musk's company Neuralink. Musk is working on implantable brain-chip interfaces to connect humans and computers. With the outbreak of the coronavirus last year, biotechnology has grown in importance. China says it will focus on "innovative vaccines" and "research on biological security." China's research will concentrate on understanding the progression of cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic diseases. The government also says that it will research some "cutting-edge" treatment technologies such as regenerative medicine. This involves medicine that can regrow or repair damaged cells, tissues and organs. China says it will also be looking at key technologies in the prevention and treatment of major transmissible diseases. Space exploration has been a top priority for China recently. Beijing said it will focus on research into the "origin and evolution of the universe," exploration of Mars as well as deep sea and polar research. In December, a Chinese spacecraft returned to Earth carrying rocks from the moon . It was the first time China has launched a spacecraft from an extraterrestrial body and the first time it has collected moon samples. And in July, China launched a mission to Mars called Tianwen -1 . — CNBC's Iris Wang contributed to this report.
The $7.5 billion tariffs on EU products and $4 billion duties on U.S. goods are now on hold for four months as both sides look to draw up a deal that will include a permanent solution over support for the aircraft sector. European officials have said the announcement marks a "reset" in trans-Atlantic relations after four fractious years under the Trump presidency, but some analysts are not convinced. There are also some sensitivities over how to deal with China and Russia.	LONDON — The U.S. and the European Union might have reached a trade truce, but some analysts have doubts over whether the two sides will be able to agree on other contentious issues such as digital taxation and relations with China. U.S. President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Friday a suspension of tariffs imposed during the Trump presidency over aircraft subsidies. The dispute first emerged in 2004 and the World Trade Organization ruled in 2019 and 2020 that the U.S. and the EU had granted illegal support to Boeing and Airbus, respectively. The $7.5 billion tariffs on EU products and $4 billion duties on U.S. goods are now on hold for four months as both sides look to draw up a deal that will include a permanent solution over support for the aircraft sector. European officials have said the announcement marks a "reset" in trans-Atlantic relations after four fractious years under the Trump presidency, but some analysts are not convinced. "The tariff suspension is a first step to defrost trade relations between Europe and the United States, and hopefully a sign that these tariffs will be taken away altogether soon," Fredrik Erixon, trade expert at the ECIPE think tank, told CNBC on Monday. "I'm less convinced that the suspension signals a completely new orientation in transatlantic trade, with new agreements to support more economic integration." One particularly contentious issue is how some of the world's biggest tech companies are taxed. The EU and the U.S. have been at odds over this matter, as well as security concerns around 5G, for years. But since Biden arrived at the White House, the EU is confident that some of these disagreements can be overcome. In fact, the U.S. has opened the door toward a deal over digital taxation, which the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development aims to conclude this summer. But Biden has not departed from all of his predecessor's policies completely. He has implemented the Buy American First initiative, to incentivize manufacturing in the country and to boost the overall economy as the coronavirus pandemic takes its toll on the world's largest economic power. In the meantime, the EU has also stepped up discussions over strategic autonomy, aiming to reduce its reliance on certain parts of the world. "Both sides are raising their economic protection against the world economy. In the U.S. by new Buy America polices, for instance, and in Europe by a general campaign to wean itself off its technology dependence on the U.S.. Both sides say they want to take trasatlanticism into a new age, but for that to happen they would first have to resolve controversial issues like digital taxes and new technology frictions," ECIPE's Erixon said. In addition, there are also some sensitivities over how to deal with China and Russia. The EU signed an investment deal with Beijing just weeks before Biden was inaugurated, despite fears the 27-member bloc could be jeopardizing its relationship with the new president. At the same time, some American lawmakers believe the EU is not assertive enough when it comes to human rights issues in China. The U.S. also opposes the gas pipeline being built from Russia to Europe and has sanctioned some firms involved in the project. However, in a press statement Friday, after a phone call with Biden, von der Leyen said, "We share a strategic outlook on Russia." Holger Schmieding, chief European economist at Berenberg, told CNBC on Monday that the next item on the trans-Atlantic to-do list could be "attempts to defuse the conflict about the Nordstream 2 pipeline." Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING in Germany, also said that the tariff suspension "doesn't mean that everything will be fine, there are still many stumble blocks ahead like Nordstream and how to deal with China." But in the meantime, European exporters can breathe a tentative sigh of relief, at a time when the region is facing a severe economic crisis. "Last week's news is good news and takes away a short-term risk for the economy we always have had to count in during the last four years," Brzeski added.
New York-listed Xpeng announced overnight it would likely deliver around 12,500 vehicles in the first quarter. Even considering the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February, those figures fall short of Nio's forecast of 20,000 to 25,000 vehicles in the first quarter. After surging in 2020, shares of U.S.-listed electric car companies have fallen in the last two months amid the U.S. stock market's volatile start to the year.	BEIJING — Chinese electric car maker Xpeng forecast it will deliver far fewer cars than rival start-up Nio in the first three months of the year. New York-listed Xpeng announced overnight it would likely deliver around 12,500 vehicles in the first quarter. That implies deliveries of 4,262 cars for March, based on January's 6,015 figure and drop to 2,223 in February. Even considering the week-long Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February, those figures fall short of Nio's. Last week, Nio forecast deliveries of 20,000 to 25,000 vehicles in the first quarter, implying deliveries of at least 7,197 cars in March. The company only delivers SUVs right now, and sells them in a higher price range than Xpeng's cars. While Nio plans to deliver a sedan to customers early next year, Xpeng launched its P7 sedan last year, which has accounted for a growing share of deliveries versus its G3 SUV. Xpeng plans to release another sedan later this year. Li Auto , another Chinese electric car company listed in the U.S., gave the lowest forecast of the three start-ups, at 10,500 to 11,500 deliveries for the first quarter. Despite the attention on start-ups like Nio and Xpeng, older automakers Tesla and BYD are already selling electric cars in China at a far greater scale. In January alone, Tesla sold more than 14,500 China-made Model 3s and BYD more than 7,200 of its Han model, according to figures from the China Passenger Car Association released Tuesday. After surging in 2020, shares of U.S.-listed electric car companies have fallen in the last two months amid the U.S. stock market's volatile start to the year. As Nio, Tesla and other car companies race to develop self-driving technology, Xpeng began rolling out its autonomous driving software to some premium P7 sedan customers this year. The technology allows users to automate tasks such as changing lanes and entering and exiting highways. About one-fifth of more than 20,100 P7 sedans delivered as of February have activated the latest self-driving software , management said on an earnings call. Xpeng reported total revenue rose 43% from the third quarter to 2.85 billion yuan ($437 million) in the fourth quarter. The company expects revenue to fall slightly to 2.6 billion yuan in the first quarter. Net losses narrowed to 787.4 million yuan in the last three months of the year from 1.15 billion yuan in the prior quarter. Correction: This article has been corrected to reflect that Xpeng's forecast implies 4,262 deliveries for March. A previous version misstated the figure.
Beaten-down U.S.-listed Chinese stocks range from social media platform and dating app operator Momo to state-owned giants like PetroChina, which plunged more than 50% and 30% in 2020, respectively. CNBC looks at three of these downtrodden names in rapidly growing Chinese industries that have  gotten a boost from a clearing of regulatory clouds, or new businesses.	For the still rapidly growing Chinese market, only some of the big names listed in the U.S. fell to cheaper prices last year. These beaten-down stocks range from social media platform and dating app operator Momo to state-owned giants like PetroChina , which plunged more than 50% and 30% in 2020, respectively. The "Dogs of the Dow" investment strategy — buying the 10 highest-yielding names of the 30-stock benchmark index — cannot be strictly applied to these downtrodden Chinese stocks since many do not pay dividends. But it's still worth looking at what names may have fallen to more attractive prices. In a fast-growing market like China, the potential gains are significant. At the high end of the China play last year were popular start-ups like electric car maker Nio — up more than 1,000% — and video platform Bilibili — up over 350% — which analysts say can run further. Here are some of last year's most beaten-down U.S.-listed Chinese stocks, including ones that are now on a tear.
Europe is currently heavily reliant on technologies that come from beyond its borders but the continent's leaders want to change this. "Nations have become worried that tech is allowing foreign powers to dominate them in all kinds of ways," Abishur Prakash, a geopolitical specialist at the Center for Innovating the Future, which is a Toronto-based consulting firm, told CNBC. The European Commission insists that tech sovereignty is not about "isolating" Europe but more about the region defending its strategic interests.	LONDON — The European Union is investing billions of euros into what it believes are fundamental and core technologies as part of an effort to boost its tech sovereignty and reduce its dependency on the U.S. and China. The Fraunhofer Institute, a state-backed German research agency, defines tech sovereignty as the ability of a state "to provide the technologies it deems critical for its welfare, competitiveness and ability to act, and to be able to develop these or source them from other economic areas without one-sided structural dependency." Europe is currently heavily reliant on technologies that come from beyond its borders but the continent's leaders want to change this. "Strengthening Europe's digital sovereignty is a key component of our digital strategy," a spokesperson for the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, told CNBC. "Europe can play a leading role on the world stage when it comes to technology." Currently, however, Europe has fallen behind when it comes to crucial technological infrastructure such as semiconductors and superfast telecoms networks. Companies like Cisco in the U.S. and Huawei in China have built the plumbing that underpins the internet for Europe's 700 million plus inhabitants. Chips largely come from manufacturers including Nvidia , Qualcomm and Intel in the U.S., Foxconn in China, Samsung in South Korea or TSMC in Taiwan, which China views as a breakaway province. Then there's the U.S. and Chinese internet platforms — think Google, Facebook , Instagram and TikTok — which have hundreds of millions of European users, who share their personal data with the companies on a phenomenal scale. "Nations have become worried that tech is allowing foreign powers to dominate them in all kinds of ways," Abishur Prakash, a geopolitical specialist at the Center for Innovating the Future, which is a Toronto-based consulting firm, told CNBC via email. "Because of this, governments are looking at tech through a new lens." The ongoing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China have not gone unnoticed by Europe's leaders. Over the last few years, the U.S. has waged a battle against Huawei , one of China's most prized technology companies, urging other countries around the world to boycott it. The U.S. has accused the Shenzhen-headquartered company of building backdoors into its equipment that can be exploited by the Chinese Communist Party for espionage purposes. Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations. Under the Trump administration, Washington blacklisted dozens of other Chinese tech companies last year including drone maker DJI. Meanwhile, Beijing has for years blocked U.S. platforms like Google, Facebook and Twitter. "In the face of growing tensions between the United States and China, Europe will not be a mere bystander, let alone a battleground," said Thierry Breton, the European Union's commissioner for the internal market, in a speech last July . "It is time to take our destiny into our own hands. This also means identifying and investing in the digital technologies that will underpin our sovereignty and our industrial future." Tech analyst Benedict Evans, a former partner at venture firm Andreessen Horrowitz, told CNBC that tech sovereignty as it relates to China and the West is interesting and important. "Your supply chain is in an unfriendly country, and both sides worry about that," he said. "Differences between the U.S., U.K. and EU seem to me nothing more than populist hand-waving." Since Breton's speech, Europe has announced plans to invest billions in technologies ranging from semiconductor chips to new telecoms infrastructure, with the view that these technologies can help facilitate developments in others, such as artificial intelligence and autonomous cars. "Europe's digital sovereignty rests on three pillars: computing power, control by Europeans over their data, and secure connectivity," a spokesperson for the European Commission said. "To this end, Europe's capability to design and produce the world's most powerful processors must be increased, innovative European clouds that guarantee data safety need to be created, and governments, firms and citizens need to have access to high-speed and secure broadband networks." Chips are used to power cars, phones, high performance computers, defense systems and AI, but Europe accounts for less than 10% of global production, although that is up from 6% five years ago. The European Commission wants to boost that figure to 20% and is exploring investing 20-30 billion euros ($24-36 billion) to make it happen. When it comes to connectivity, the European Commission wants 100% of the European population to be able to access 1 gigabit per second download speeds; average speeds are currently well below 100 megabits per second. It is starting to prepare for 6G and looking at using satellites to beam internet across the continent. Breton and European Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager included the targets in a new "2030 Digital Compass" plan on Tuesday that is designed to translate the EUʼs digital ambitions for 2030 into "concrete terms." They also said that they want Europe to build its first quantum computer — a machine that employs quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to carry out computing tasks — in the next five years. "As a continent, Europe has to ensure that its citizens and businesses have access to a choice of state-of-the-art technologies that will make their life better, safer, and even greener — provided they also have the skills to use them," said Breton in a statement. "In the post pandemic world, this is how we will shape together a resilient and digitally sovereign Europe," he added. "This is Europe's Digital Decade." The European Commission insists that tech sovereignty is not about "isolating" Europe but more about the region defending its strategic interests and being assertive of its values. "It's about protecting our companies against predatory and sometimes politically motivated foreign acquisitions," said Breton. "And it's about developing the right technological projects that can lead to European alternatives in key strategic technologies." Europe has already lost some of its biggest and most important technology companies to behemoths in the U.S. and China in the last decade. London AI lab DeepMind was sold to Google in 2014 for around $600 million, while chip designer Arm was sold to Japan's SoftBank in 2016. SoftBank is now in the process of trying to sell Arm to U.S. chip giant Nvidia for a reported $40 billion, in a deal that critics say will reduce competition. Elsewhere in Europe, Apple acquired part of Dialog Semiconductor, a German chip business, in a deal valued at around $600 million, while PayPal bought Swedish payments start-up iZettle for $2.2 billion. But Prakash, from the Center for Innovating the Future, said the world will become more divided as nations and nation states strive for tech sovereignty. "As more governments use technology to reassert control, they will also end up 'limiting' their relationship with the rest of the world," he said, adding that "nations will take action against one another in a way that results in the world becoming fragmented."
Russia and China are making plans to further their geopolitical relationship, this time, in space with the building of a new space station on the moon. The countries' space agencies, Russia's Roscosmos and China's National Space Administration (CNSA), signed Tuesday a 'Memorandum of Understanding' on behalf of their respective governments signaling their commitment to create a new lunar space station.	Russia and China are making plans to further their geopolitical relationship, this time in space with the building of a new lunar station. The countries' space agencies, Russia's Roscosmos and China's National Space Administration, signed Tuesday a "memorandum of understanding" on behalf of their respective governments signaling their commitment to create a new lunar space station. The International Lunar Research Station, they said in a statement , will be "a comprehensive scientific experiment base with the capability of long-term autonomous operation, built on the lunar surface and/or on the lunar orbit." It will carry out "multi-disciplinary and multi-objective" scientific research activities such as lunar exploration and "utilization," lunar-based observation and scientific experiments, they added. Both countries will work together on the planning, design, development and operation of the station. No date was outlined for when the project might begin, or be completed. China and Russia are no strangers to cooperation within space and are looking to build on that relationship. They noted there have been previous agreements to cooperate on other projects including China's Chang'e-7 mission (a planned robotic lunar exploration mission expected to be launched in 2023 or 2024), and a joint data center for lunar and deep space exploration. Roscosmos and the CNSA said they would "facilitate extensive cooperation in the ILRS" saying it would be "open to all interested countries and international partners, strengthen scientific research exchanges, and promote humanity's exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purpose." Russia and China's strengthening of ties, both on Earth and in space, continues a trend that has emerged in recent years . That deepening alliance, which spans increasing economic, military and political cooperation, even led Chinese President Xi Jinping to call his Russian counterpart President Vladimir Putin his "best friend" in 2019, in an uncharacteristic display of warm relations. This burgeoning geopolitical friendship has come as their respective relationships with the U.S. have deteriorated in recent years, however, with U.S. sanctions on Russia and billions of dollars' worth of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, implemented under former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, competition in the space arena has not subsided since the so-called "space race" of the mid-20th century, which saw rivals the Soviet Union and U.S. compete in missions to launch and advance space technology and knowledge. There are newcomers to the industry of space exploration and commercial space travel with the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX company, which now conducts regular crew and cargo missions for NASA and other organizations to the International Space Station. To date, SpaceX has conducted 23 visits to the ISS. Veterans of space exploration are still big players, nonetheless. NASA also plans to return to the moon in 2024, with its Artemis program that includes plans to land the first woman and the next man on the surface of the moon . It would be the first lunar landing since the last Apollo lunar mission in 1972.
The Shanghai composite fell 1.8% Tuesday to its lowest since December and has fallen more than 5% over the last five trading days. Comments from top officials this month around the country's annual Two Sessions parliamentary meeting have noted concerns about rising risks in the local stock and property market. China's relatively low GDP target of over 6% announced Friday will allow policymakers to curb those risks, likely resulting in a near-term pull-back in stocks, analysts said.	BEIJING — Mainland Chinese stocks have tumbled in the last few days as authorities set a relatively low GDP target and signaled a shift away from policies meant to keep the economy afloat in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The Shanghai composite has dropped more than 5% over the last five trading days, with losses accelerating this week to the index's lowest since December, according to Wind Information. Other mainland stock indexes such as the Star 50, which tracks big names on the technology stock board, and the CSI 300 are down nearly 8% or more over the last five trading days. The indexes rose on Wednesday after U.S. markets recovered overnight from a recent sell-off. After the mainland Chinese stock market's significant gains over the last six months, investors are focused on two things, Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said Wednesday. One is concerns over a rollback of supportive fiscal and monetary policy based on comments out of China's annual parliamentary meeting; the other is the sell-off in the U.S. market, particularly in high-flying technology stocks , he said. Top officials from the People's Bank of China and banking regulator have warned this month about financial market risks. Their comments come alongside China's biggest political event of the year, the "Two Sessions" parliamentary meeting. As part of the gathering, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced Friday the country would target GDP growth of over 6% for the year, on the low end of many economists' estimates . Li said no new bonds would be issued for responding to the pandemic and that deficit and inflation targets would be lower than last year. In a report Monday, Citi analysts called the GDP growth target "very conservative" and said it would relieve pressure on policymakers to achieve fast growth, allowing them to take more stringent measures for containing risks in stocks and the property market. As a result, they expect authorities will limit growth in lending, constricting the potential amount of capital that could go into buying stocks. The Citi analysts estimate the CSI 300 could fall 10% from its levels on Friday, March 5. The CSI 300 was down about 4% from Friday's close as of midday Wednesday. Economists in China have been closely watching U.S. markets, where government stimulus and a rise in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield have raised some concerns about risks of "imported inflation." So far, domestic measures of such price increases remain muted. China reported a 0.2% decline in the consumer price index for February from a year ago and a 1.7% increase in the producer price index. Instead, market strategists are pointing to longer-term opportunities in Chinese stocks given the recent sell-off and the announcement of details for the country's five-year development plan that kicks off this year. The development roadmap, known as the 14th five-year plan, intends to ramp up China's technological abilities, increase the role of consumption in boosting economic growth and address issues such as China's aging population. Xuan Wei, chief strategist of China Asset Management, said in a note that in the mid- to long-term, he's optimistic on investment opportunities in technology, consumer trends and medicine.
Tesla's Model Y was the third best-selling electric car in China in February, according to data released Wednesday by the China Passenger Car Association. Tesla announced on New Year's Day the China-made mid-size SUV would begin deliveries at a price that Chinese media said was 30% cheaper than previously announced. The data show Chinese start-ups still lag bigger automakers in China's electric vehicle market.	BEIJING — Tesla 's Model Y is getting off to a solid start in China, less than three months since deliveries began. The mid-size SUV was the third best-selling electric car in February at 4,630 vehicles, according to data released Wednesday by the China Passenger Car Association. Taking January into account, the data showed the car was the ninth-best seller among new energy vehicles, a category that includes electric cars. Tesla announced on New Year's Day its China-made Model Y would begin deliveries at a price that Chinese media said was 30% cheaper than previously announced. The Model Y was popular even though car sales typically fall during the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which was in February this year. Nationwide passenger car sales fell 45.5% in February from January, according to the association. For the first two months of the year, that data showed nearly 3.34 million passenger cars have been sold in China, with new energy vehicles accounting for 7.5%. Chinese electric car start-ups Xpeng and Li Auto both announced a sharp drop in deliveries in February to just over 2,000 vehicles each and low forecasts for the first quarter. Rival Nio led the group with roughly twice the deliveries in February and a much higher guidance for the quarter. The three Chinese start-ups' vehicles rank among the top 15 new energy cars sold in China in the first two months of the year, according to the passenger car association data. But the start-ups still lag bigger automakers in China's electric vehicle market. First place went to the Hongguang Mini, a low-cost miniature electric car developed by General Motors ' joint venture with Wuling Motors and state-owned SAIC Motor . Tesla's Model 3 sedan, which was the best-selling electric car in China last year, ranked second for February and the first two months of the year, according to the association's data. In third place for January and February combined was BYD 's luxury Han sedan, the data showed. The vehicle, which comes in both pure-electric and hybrid models, has surged in popularity since its launch last summer. Due to reliance on self-reporting, some in China's auto industry have cast doubt on the accuracy of the association's figures .
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang emphasized the country's need to build up its own talent, amid tensions with the U.S. Li was addressing reporters Thursday immediately after the close of a largely symbolic annual parliamentary meeting. The comments contrast with Li's emphasis on attracting foreign businesses during last year's same post-parliamentary meeting with reporters.	BEIJING — As tensions with the U.S. simmer, China's second-in-command emphasized the country's need to build up its own talent. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang was addressing reporters Thursday immediately after the close of a largely symbolic annual parliamentary meeting.  This year, the so-called Two Sessions officially approved China's development plan for the next five years — and goals for the year 2035. The document lays out seven areas of scientific research that Beijing plans to focus on in an effort to build technological "self-reliance." Li reiterated calls for the U.S. to cooperate and not interfere with China's "internal" affairs, and focused most of his comments on how Beijing intended to bolster its own economy. After stressing the need to support scientists in research and development, Li said, "I want to say a few words to young students. Regardless of what your future career or ambitions are, you must strengthen your learning of basic knowledge." That's according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks. This knowledge "goes hand in hand" with innovation, Li said. He also said this year, China is determined to improve training of teachers in rural areas, and migrant children with urban resident permits must receive an education. In addition to domestic talent development and investment in research, Li said China needed to collaborate with other countries on technological development. The comments contrast with Li's emphasis on attracting foreign businesses during last year's same post-parliamentary meeting with reporters. In a government work report delivered March 5 and his remarks to reporters Thursday, Li repeated Beijing's commitment to open its market further to foreign businesses and investment. Beijing had rushed to pass a new foreign investment law during the Two Sessions in 2019, and subsequently pushed ahead with removing foreign ownership limits in major parts of the financial industry. But the tone during this year's parliamentary meeting was more subdued. Instead, the premier's remarks focused more on the potential from China's growing economy and the state's efforts to support over 1.4 billion people. Li said the government would expand reimbursement programs to improve the elderly's access to health care, while noting the country's aging population creates new business opportunities. He added the government would improve protection for some 200 million "flexible" workers who don't hold traditional jobs with regular working hours. In the face of "very high" pressure on ensuring employment, China aims to create at least 11 million new urban jobs. The country has set a target of over 6% GDP growth this year, and a goal of increasing spending on research and development by at least 7% annually in the next five years. On Thursday, Li struck a confident tone in China's ability to find talent to lead that research — and emphasized that anyone in the country could contribute to the national effort to promote innovation.
China's growth target for 2021 is not particularly meaningful because it is well within reach for the country, two analysts told CNBC this week. "It almost does the same thing as not having a growth target on there because it's such an easy target to hit," said Michael Hirson, Eurasia Group's practice head for China and Northeast Asia. Addressing reporters at the close of the annual parliamentary meeting on Thursday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said: "By setting the GDP growth target at above 6%, we have left possibilities open, which means in actual delivery, there may be even faster growth."	China's target of more than 6% growth for 2021 is not very meaningful because it can be easily reached — but that's not necessarily a bad thing, analysts told CNBC this week. "It almost does the same thing as not having a growth target on there because it's such an easy target to hit," said Michael Hirson, Eurasia Group's practice head for China and Northeast Asia. Simon Baptist, chief economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), echoed the same sentiment. "It will easily be met," he told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Thursday. "It's sort of a target that you have when you don't really want to have a target." Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced last week that the country is aiming for economic expansion of more than 6% this year. He was speaking at the opening ceremony of China's National People's Congress. Addressing reporters on Thursday evening, at the close of the annual parliamentary meeting, Li said China's target was not low. The 2021 target should match that of 2022 in order to avoid large gyrations, he said. "By setting the GDP growth target at above 6%, we have left possibilities open, which means in actual delivery, there may be even faster growth," the premier said. The EIU predicts that China's growth will be around 8.5% this year, more than 2 percentage points higher than the official target, according to Baptist. To be clear, a goal that is easy to reach is not pointless, analysts said. Eurasia's Hirson said it is consistent with China's desire to prioritize quality over quantity. "It drives home a message to local officials and to the rest of the system: Don't stretch for growth target, focus on quality of growth and I think that's exactly right," he told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Thursday. Additionally, he noted that the country's five-year plan doesn't have an average growth target, which shows a "continued deemphasis on hitting rigid" numbers. Baptist from the EIU said previous growth targets  have caused "dangerous imbalances in China's economy" in the past, including a build up in debt as the country pushed certain sectors to reach those "very high targets." However, since the number for 2021 is low, it's unlikely to further fuel these problems, he added. "In fact, the fact that it's so far below what China is likely to achieve just at a canter, indicates that economic policy is going to be a little bit tight in China and that fiscal, monetary support will be coming down," he said.
Hong Kong's legislative body will become "largely ceremonial" much like the one in Beijing, said Kurt Tong, former U.S. consul general and chief of mission in Hong Kong and Macau. China on Thursday approved a draft decision that will alter the size and composition of Hong Kong's legislature and election committee. Those electoral changes will follow the controversial national security law that China imposed in Hong Kong last year.	A former U.S. diplomat said China's latest move to tighten its control over Hong Kong will turn the semi-autonomous region's legislative body into something that's "largely ceremonial." "I think what we'll see in the years ahead is that the legislative council ... will become a largely ceremonial organization — similar to the legislative apparatus in Beijing," Kurt Tong, former U.S. consul general and chief of mission in Hong Kong and Macau, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Friday. Beijing on Thursday approved a draft decision to change Hong Kong's electoral system . The proposed measures will alter the size and composition of Hong Kong's legislature and election committee. In response, the U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a Thursday statement : "This is the latest step by Beijing to hollow out the space for democratic debate in Hong Kong, contrary to the promises made by China itself." Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department condemned the move and said the changes were "a direct attack on Hong Kong's autonomy, its freedoms and democratic processes." Hong Kong is a former British colony that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. It is governed under a "one country, two systems" framework that promises the city greater autonomy than other mainland Chinese cities, including legislative and independent judicial power. The city's leader, Carrie Lam, said in a Thursday statement that the changes proposed by Beijing are aimed at making sure that Hong Kong is governed by "patriots." That will "resolve the problem of the LegCo making everything political in recent years," she said referring to the legislative council. It will "effectively deal with the reckless moves or internal rift that have torn Hong Kong apart," she added. Hong Kong's legislature "already previously had limited capability to actually draft laws. Now, I think it'll have even less capability to shape laws," said Tong, who's now a partner at advisory firm The Asia Group. The latest proposed electoral changes come less than a year after China  imposed a controversial national security law in Hong Kong — bypassing the city's legislature. The law followed months of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong that sometimes turned violent. Tong said Beijing's aim is to "quiet political opposition," but "not change terribly how Hong Kong operates as an economy." That means Hong Kong has so far retained features that made it an international business center, such as its connection to the rest of the world and a largely independent judiciary, said Tong. Still, the business community is watching the situation in Hong Kong closely "with a certain degree of concern" even if companies are not leaving the city, he added. "The national security law I think has been the bigger concern with respect to the judiciary," said Tong. "There are reasons for concern but I think people are just gonna need to watch it closely and see what happens."
Kweichow Moutai sells "baijiu" which has an alcohol content of about 43% to 53% and can cost about a few hundred U.S. dollars per bottle. Moutai is the strongest brand in the high-end baijiu market, and will grow its share even as China's drinking culture subsides, said Luo Hao, equity analyst with Global Capital Investment at China Asset Management. Earlier this year, the stock's rapid surge in price drew internet memes comparing it to bitcoin's high-flying price and the GDP of Chinese cities.	BEIJING — The biggest stock in the mainland Chinese "A share" market is a liquor company that analysts are betting on for the long term, despite its plunge in the last month. Kweichow Moutai sells "baijiu" which has an alcohol content of about 43% to 53% and can cost about a few hundred U.S. dollars per bottle. Baijiu — literally "white spirits" — is a staple at Chinese business and government dinners for forging relationships and deals. The stock was down about 1% year-to-date as of Monday morning, holding 2020's gains of roughly 70%. Earlier this year, the stock's rapid surge in price drew internet memes comparing it to the GDP of Chinese cities and bitcoin's high-flying price. Cryptocurrency bitcoin has surged more than 80% this year to above $60,000. Moutai's share price had climbed 30% from Dec. 31 to a record high just before the Lunar New Year in mid-February, when it achieved a market value of $500 billion. That's been shaved by over $100 billion in the weeks since, as shares fell more than 20% amid a broad sell-off in Chinese stocks. But Kweichow Moutai still has a bigger valuation than any other mainland A share stock, including the giant ICBC bank, according to Wind Information. Moutai is the strongest brand in the high-end baijiu market and will grow its share even as China's drinking culture subsides, said Luo Hao, equity analyst with Global Capital Investment at China Asset Management. He pointed to the company's steady growth and returns for investors as reasons why he favors the stock. Moutai expects it made about 97.7 billion yuan ($15.1 billion) in operating income last year, for growth of 10% amid the coronavirus pandemic. The company is set to release final 2020 results at the end of this month, according to Bernstein analysts. Wind data showed that as of March 11, the liquor stock had the largest number of non-mainland institutions investing in it among A share stocks, with 101 firms holding 7.7% of the total market share. That's up from only a handful of firms earlier this year, the database showed. Moutai and another baijiu manufacturer, Wuliangye, are the top two members of MSCI's China A index , which is tracked by many foreign funds wanting to invest in China. "We have a positive long-term view on the China Ultra Premium Baijiu. We expect superior industry value growth to be driven by increasing incomes which will continue driving affordability led up-trading," Bernstein analysts said in a note this month. While they prefer Wuliangye to Moutai due to supply chain and governance concerns, the Bernstein analysts still have a "buy" rating on Moutai and a price target of 2,500 yuan a share. That's up more than 20% from Moutai's Friday closing price of 2,026 yuan per share. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.
In January, the Trump administration designated Xiaomi as a "Communist Chinese military companies" or CCMC. This meant the world's third-largest smartphone maker was subject to a November executive order restricting American investors from buying shares or related securities of any companies. But on Friday, a U.S. judge granted Xiaomi a preliminary injunction against the Trump-era order.	GUANGZHOU, China — Shares of Xiaomi jumped Monday after a U.S. judge temporarily blocked a move by former President Donald Trump's administration to bar Americans from investing in the Chinese smartphone maker. Shares of Xiaomi surged more than 10% in early trade, but have since pared their gains. The stock was still up about 8% in early afternoon trade. In January, the Trump administration designated Xiaomi as one of several "Communist Chinese military companies" or CCMC. This meant the world's third-largest smartphone maker was subject to a November executive order restricting American investors from buying shares or related securities of any companies given this designation by the U.S. Department of Defense. Xiaomi said at the time that it was "not owned, controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military" and subsequently filed a lawsuit to overturn the designation and stop the investment ban . In a Friday ruling, U.S. district judge Rudolph Contreras granted Xiaomi a preliminary injunction against the Trump-era order. The judge said that without relief, Xiaomi would "suffer irreparable harm in the form of serious reputational and unrecoverable economic injuries." Contreras wrote there is "plainly a lack of substantial evidence to adequately support a finding that Xiaomi is a CCMC." Xiaomi said it was "pleased" with the ruling and said it will "continue to request that the court declare the designation unlawful and to permanently remove the designation." "Xiaomi reiterates that it is a widely held, publicly traded, independently managed corporation that offers consumer electronics products solely for civilian and commercial use," the company said in a statement on Saturday. "Xiaomi believes that the decisions of designating it as a Chinese Communist Military Company are arbitrary and  capricious, and the judge agrees with it."
The unemployment rate for those aged 16 to 24 was 13.1% as of February, far above the national urban jobless rate of 5.5%, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday. While China's economy has grown steadily, data on unemployment and job creation point to underlying challenges.	BEIJING — One year since the coronavirus pandemic hit, China's young people are still having a hard time finding jobs. The unemployment rate for those aged 16 to 24 was 13.1% as of February, far above the national urban jobless rate of 5.5%, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday. The 13.1% young people's unemployment rate is the same as it was during the first quarter last year, the height of the coronavirus outbreak within China. The high figure implies "continuous challenge from underemployment and pressure on the job market," said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance. He added that based on a contraction in labor measures from monthly government and third-party surveys, companies don't seem eager to fill vacancies as momentum in the economic recovery slows. Young people face particularly high competition for jobs. This year, a record 9.09 million students are expected to enter the workforce, surpassing last year's record of 8.74 million, according to official figures. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the number of new urban jobs fell to 13.52 million in 2019, down from 13.61 million in 2018, according to official figures. Last year, as the world struggled to recover from the pandemic, just 11.86 million new urban jobs were created. China aims to create 11 million new urban jobs this year, and achieve an unemployment rate of 5.5%. In an annual review of the economy this month, Premier Li Keqiang said there is "mounting" pressure on ensuring people have jobs. China's economy grew 2.3% last year and authorities have set a conservative growth target of over 6% for this year. In contrast with countries that have handed out cash to citizens to stimulate spending, China has focused on supporting businesses — and their employees — with tax cuts and cheaper loans. Li shared with reporters Thursday how the owner of a store hit by the pandemic was able to keep the business' roughly 20 workers afloat with a living allowance.
The United States saw at least $1.3 billion in potential agricultural exports rejected at major ports on the East and West coasts, from July to December last year, according to a CNBC analysis. The rejections were particularly heavy in December, according to analysis of data compiled from the Census Bureau and the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in California, and the Port of New York in New Jersey. This investigation comes at a time where China's exports hit records. The full year trade surplus reached $535 billion, the highest since 2015.	The United States saw at least $1.3 billion in potential agricultural exports rejected at major ports on the East and West coasts, from July to December last year, according to a CNBC analysis. The rejections were particularly heavy in December, according to analysis of data compiled from the Census Bureau and the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in California, and the Port of New York in New Jersey. The estimated total value of lost export trade from the three ports for December was a minimum of $257.5 million. The Port of New York and New Jersey saw its largest volume of export rejections for 2020 during December. The maritime carriers' export decisions at these ports are under investigation by the Federal Maritime Commission. Commissioners are examining whether this denial of trade is in violation of the 1984 Shipping Act. This investigation comes at a time where China's exports hit records. The full year trade surplus reached $535 billion, the highest since 2015. One of the key legal obligations in the Shipping Act is the nondiscriminatory regulatory process by the carriers for the movement of goods by water. Maritime carriers have been favoring sending back empty containers to China in an effort to quickly fill the boxes so they can be transported along the more lucrative China-U.S. route. According to the Freightos Baltic Index, carriers are charging $5,548 a container to the East Coast, and $4,571 to the West Coast. U.S. agricultural export containers take longer to process because the product needs to be unloaded and the container needs to be cleaned. The route from the U.S. to China is also a fraction of the price ($715 a container), so carriers can afford to return empties instead of containers full of agriculture. "Carrier practices are not only inflicting significant financial damage to U.S. exporters and importers, but are extremely short-sighted," said Peter Friedmann, executive director of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition. "Those practices are causing U.S. exporters to lose foreign customers, and setting the stage for the ocean carriers themselves to lose significant business in the future." In December, shippers rejected an estimated 72,508 containers known as 20-foot equivalent units, or TEUs, according to CNBC's data anlysis. That tally was calculated by taking the difference between the actual empty exports in 2020 versus the 2019 share of export empties. The difference represents the amount of empty container exports that should have been filled in 2020. From July through December, a total of 370,505 TEUs were denied out of the ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach, and New York and New Jersey, with a container deficit value of $1.3 billion. To calculate the minimal value in the potential lost trade as a result of the rejection of agricultural exports, CNBC used the Port of Los Angeles' containerized agricultural export price for soybeans/oilseeds/grains, which can be found on the U.S. Census, USA Trade Online site. The value of this export is $3,552 a TEU.  It is one of the lower valued exports. Starting in the new year, China traditionally starts buying from the United States' top soybean competitor, Brazil. The Agriculture Transportation Coalition's Friedmann says this rejection of trade can only provide more opportunity for Brazil. "Brazil expanded its soybean production during the trade war and this denial of trade can only help them at the expense of the U.S. farmer," said Friedmann. "When foreign customers are denied affordable/dependable U.S. ag exports by carrier practices, they find alternative sourcing to U.S. agriculture, and simply do not return to their U.S. sources." Friedmann said Asian buyers are frustrated. One of the largest soybean buyers in Asia is looking to switch delivery of U.S. soybeans from container to bulk freight, which can impact American jobs. "Major China animal feed importers of U.S. soybeans are fed up with ocean carrier practices, charges and the dependably of container delivery," Friedmann explained. "Once these Chinese customers switch, they may never come back to the container model and that impact jobs at the port. Container ships generate more man-hours. This will mean many fewer containers to be loaded at our marine terminals, less work for longshoremen and fewer containers to be carried on container vessels, for years to come." The decrease in U.S. exports can also be tracked in the global containerized trade data by local and global transport and logistics research company MDS Transmodal, China's share of global exports increased in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. North America's global export share however, never recovered. "The increase in global trade was mainly driven by China, which has not only retained the title of 'factory of the world' but improved its position," explained Antonella Teodoro, Senior Consultant at MDST. The Northwest Seaport Alliance, the fourth-largest container gateway in North America, comprised of the Port of Seattle and Port of Tacoma, tells CNBC it also suffered a large loss in exports. In 2019, the ports moved out 913,332 containers of full exports. In 2020, that number dropped to 790,620 containers. "Our exporters are suffering," said John Wolfe, chief executive officer of The Northwest Seaport Alliance. "We have spoken with our terminal operators and carriers about this issue and there is more work to be done by all in order to address the extreme challenges faced by our export community." CNBC sent its findings to FMC Commissioner Louis Sola. "I can say for a fact that some carriers have decreased their exports in return for empties (mainly the European lines)  while other have made a conscious effort to pick up the slack and increases their exports in 2020 (mostly the Asian lines)," said Sola. "I do find this most interesting and warrant that it requires further discussion." Sola said he is also keeping an eye on the potential jobs impact. "This assertion warrants review. We support our longshore workers. Indeed, that is why I have attempted to draw attention to the loss of work generated by the cessation of cruises to our cruise ports across the nation and speak out for the safe resumption of cruising," he said. The imbalance of trade has created an outpouring of letters by American exporters pleading for intervention by the Federal Maritime Commission. Letters have also been sent by politicians on both sides of the aisle. FMC Commissioner Rebecca Dye is currently leading an investigation into the carrier's actions in a Fact Finding 29 investigation. The investigation was authorized in March 2020 , and was expanded in November to include the container return and container availability for U.S. export cargo, as well as the charges in storage and late fees carriers are charging exporters. "No public servant enjoys a trade deficit unless it is the other fellow's deficit," said Sola. "America is best served when we ship more product out than we ship in."
The Indo-Pacific is set to play a much bigger role in U.S. foreign policy and Asia will be a top priority, political experts said. Part of that priority is the shoring up of an informal strategic alliance between the United States, Japan, India and Australia, known as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will be in Japan and South Korea this week visiting Washington's two major military allies in Asia. Blinken will then meet with Chinese officials Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi on March 18 in Alaska.	The Indo-Pacific is set to play a much bigger role in U.S. foreign policy, with Asia being a top priority, according to political experts. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin are in Japan and South Korea this week, visiting Washington's two major military allies in Asia where tens of thousands of troops are stationed. Last Friday, President Joe Biden virtually met the prime ministers of Japan, India and Australia as part of the first leaders' summit of an informal strategic alliance — the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad as it's known. "Asia is the priority," said Angela Mancini, a partner at Control Risks, on CNBC's " Capital Connection " Monday. She explained that based on last week's Quad meeting as well as the overall diplomacy that's happening with the current administration, the U.S. is making it very clear that the Indo-Pacific region is important to Washington — compared to the previous administration's transactional approach. "In addition to shoring up alliances to potentially counter China, there are some specific bilateral issues as well to deal with," Mancini said, adding that it includes the presence of U.S. troops in the region. The Biden administration is building on the framework that the Trump administration left with regard to the Indo-Pacific strategy and is developing a coalition of partners to collaborate with, according to Akhil Bery, South Asia analyst at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. The flurry of diplomatic activities in Asia by U.S. officials comes ahead of Blinken's meeting with Chinese officials Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi on March 18 in Alaska. Exact geographical definition of the Indo-Pacific varies by countries and administrations but broadly, it is the interconnected area between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean , joined together by the straits of Malacca in the heart of Southeast Asia. The term has gained prominence in geopolitical discourse and many analysts have suggested that U.S. efforts to shore up bilateral and multilateral alliances in the region is designed to counter China's growing influence. Beijing has been increasingly aggressive in the East China Sea and South China Sea in recent years. The informal Quad alliance positions itself as being committed to a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific. The group is set to take on a much more important role in the region and can potentially become "a nucleus of a larger regional security architecture" going forward, according to Harsh Pant, head of the strategic studies program at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. For more than a decade, the Quad has had a lackluster existence even after geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China worsened starting in 2017, followed by a deterioration in relations between India and China , Pant said Monday on CNBC's " Street Signs Asia ." The group's profile has risen in the last few months, he said. Last year, India invited Australia to participate in the Malabar naval exercises alongside the U.S. and Japan. For years, New Delhi resisted Canberra's participation by taking into account the move would provoke Beijing. Pant said India appears to be reevaluating its policy toward China after being a "fence sitter" in the larger balance of power in the region. New Delhi is now "making its reasons for joining certain platforms very clear," he added. Last Friday's joint statement from the Quad avoided any direct mention of China and its foreign policies in the region and focused instead on areas such as Covid-19 vaccine distribution efforts. That agreement is already a "significant step forward, and shows that the group is capable of delivering on tangible deliverables, rather than just talking about the China challenge," Eurasia Group's Bery told CNBC by email. While it remains to be seen to what extent the Biden administration can get allies to approach developments in the region from a multilateral perspective, it is likely that Beijing will push back, said Mancini from Control Risks. "China is feeling that they're being encircled by the U.S. and that feeling is real and growing, and so they are going to push back with their own investments in tech spending and their own focus on the domestic economy," she said.
Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the acceleration of laws and rules for so-called "platform" companies. The term "platform" is used as a broad brush label for technology companies operating anything from social media businesses to e-commerce and could include the likes of Tencent and Alibaba. Xi said regulations need to "fill in gaps and loopholes in rules" for such platform companies.	GUANGZHOU, China — Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the acceleration of laws and rules for so-called "platform" companies, a sign that Beijing will further crack down on the country's technology giants. "Some platform companies' development is not standard and risks exist," Xi said in an address to China's top economic committee, according to state broadcaster CCTV. The term "platform" is used as a broad brush label usually for technology companies operating anything from social media businesses to e-commerce and could include the likes of Tencent and Alibaba . Xi said regulations need to "fill in gaps and loopholes in rules" for such platform companies. He said that regulators need to step up oversight of these companies, prevent monopolies, promote fair competition and stop disorderly expansion of capital. Xi also said that regulators must create a "data property rights system." So far regulators have made a number of comments about rules on technology companies. But the latest focus comes straight from China's top leaders, indicating there is likely to be further action taken against the private tech giants. Beijing has so far cracked down on billionaire Jack Ma's empire. Firstly, Ant Group, Alibaba's financial affiliate, was forced to halt its $34.5 billion initial public offering in Hong Kong and Shanghai . Ant cited "significant issues such as the changes in financial technology regulatory environment" for the cancellation. Alibaba was also slapped with a fine in December for not reporting previous deals properly to regulators. There are now signs that regulators' crosshairs could focus on other technology firms. Bloomberg reported on Monday that regulators could now turn their sights to Tencent's financial technology business.
Huawei will begin charging smartphone makers a royalty to use its patented 5G technology. The Chinese telecom company will charge an amount with a "per unit royalty cap" at $2.50 for smartphones capable of connections to 5G and previous generations of mobile networks. Huawei has 3,007 declared 5G patent families, the highest out of any company in the world.	GUANGZHOU, China — Huawei will begin charging smartphone makers a royalty to use its patented 5G technology as the Chinese technology firm looks to open a new revenue stream, even as other parts of its business have taken a hit due to U.S. sanctions. The company said that it will charge "a reasonable percentage royalty rate of the handset selling price, and a per unit royalty cap" at $2.50 for smartphones capable of connections to 5G and previous generations of mobile networks. This price is lower than some of Huawei's competitors including Finnish telecoms company Nokia . Charging royalties on key patents related to cellular technology could help Huawei make up at least part of the revenue hit in other parts of its business, such as smartphones, as a result of U.S. sanctions . In the past, Huawei has charged royalties to companies such as Apple . When a new generation of cellular technology is being developed, so-called global standards need to be created. These are protocols, technical specifications and design that allow interoperability between 5G networks globally and allows smartphones to communicate with these networks. Standards bodies are tasked with creating these. Companies such as Huawei, Nokia, Swedish telecom equipment giant Ericsson , U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm and many others contribute to the standards development process. In doing so, these companies devise technologies which they then patent. The patents, which are critical to the standards of say 4G or 5G, will be deemed a "standard essential patent" or SEP. If for example a smartphone maker wants to release a 5G handset, they're likely going to need to use the SEPs of one or more of these companies. In return, these companies can ask for a royalty fee. It's a practice that has been around for a long time. Deciding what is and what isn't an SEP can be tricky and can lead to high profile litigation between two parties. Huawei has 3,007 declared 5G patent families, the highest out of any company in the world, according to analysis by intellectual property research organization GreyB. Patent families are a group of same or similar patents filed in different countries. GreyB estimates that around 18.3% of those Huawei 5G patent families are SEPs that are in use, more than any other company. The other top patent holders are South Korean firms Samsung and LG Electronics, Nokia, Ericsson and Qualcomm. Huawei's $2.50 cap on royalties for smartphone makers is on the lower end compared to its rivals. In 2018, Nokia said the licensing rate for its 5G SEP portfolio will be capped at 3 euro ($3.58) per device. Ericsson said it will charge $2.50 to $5 per device. Huawei has charged royalties for companies for its 4G patents. The Chinese firm estimates it will receive about $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in revenue from patent licensing between 2019 and 2021. In the past, Huawei has not been very aggressive on royalties or litigation. But that could now change. "The reason for that is first of all Huawei's position in the world, in a lot of countries, Huawei has been facing tough challenges selling their products," said Muzammil Hassan, head of the intellectual property licensing and commercialization department at GreyB. Huawei has been hit with a number of sanctions by the U.S. which has accused the company of being a national security threat. Huawei has repeatedly denied this claim. But in 2019, the Chinese phonemaker was put on a U.S. blacklist called the Entity List which blocked American firms from exporting some technology to Huawei. Last year, Washington moved to cut Huawei off from key chip supplies . These actions have caused Huawei's smartphone shipments to plunge . Meanwhile, a number of countries such as the U.S. and Australia have effectively blocked Huawei gear from being part of their respective 5G networks. There are now signs Huawei has been getting more aggressive on intellectual property litigation. Last year, Huawei filed two lawsuits against Verizon alleging the U.S. carrier infringed patents held by the Chinese telecoms giant.
Alibaba's "UC Browser" has been removed from several app stores in China. It comes a day after President Xi Jinping said Beijing's crackdown on large technology firms was just beginning. Alibaba's browser has been removed from app stores operated by Huawei and Xiaomi.	Alibaba's internet browser has been removed from several app stores in China as the company's feud with the Chinese government continues. Android app stores including those operated by Huawei and Xiaomi have blocked downloads or removed Alibaba's "UC Browser," according to Huawei and Xiaomi phone owners who spoke to CNBC. However, one Samsung phone owner in China said they could still see the browser in Samsung's app store. The UC Browser is also still available on Apple's App Store. The news was first reported by The Financial Times. It comes after the UC Browser was criticized on a TV show, broadcast by state-owned broadcaster CCTV, about misleading online medical advertising. The show accused the browser of allowing private hospitals to bid for the names of China's best known hospitals in keyword searches. Thus potentially luring patients to their websites instead of the public hospitals they are supposed to visit. A spokesperson from Alibaba's UC Browser team told CNBC: "We attach high importance to problems shown in the show, and quickly conducted a series of measures to check and correct." They said the "illegal ad contents" that was referred to in the CCTV show had been removed immediately. "We will further enhance content review and shoulder more responsibility, and provide good info services with stricter standards," they added. It comes as  Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Monday that Beijing's crackdown on large technology firms was just beginning. "Some platform companies' development is not standard and risks exist," Xi said in an address to China's top economic committee, according to state broadcaster CCTV. Regulators blocked the $37 billion IPO of Alibaba's financial technology affiliate Ant Group last November and Jack Ma, Alibaba's founder and the richest person in China, has hardly been seen in public since. — Additional reporting by CNBC's Arjun Kharpal.
Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, sent an eerie message to the United States on Tuesday. Her comments coincided with the arrival of Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in the region. The Biden administration has tried unsuccessfully to restart talks with North Korea.	WASHINGTON – The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent an eerie message to the United States on Tuesday, as Biden administration officials arrive for high-level talks in Japan and South Korea. "We take this opportunity to warn the new U.S. administration trying hard to give off [gun] powder smell in our land," Kim Yo Jong said in a statement referencing joint U.S. and South Korean military exercises in the region. "If it [the U.S.] wants to sleep in peace for the coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step," she added, according to an English translation. Kim's comments, carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, are the first reactions from Pyongyang since President Joe Biden took office, and coincided with the arrival of Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in the region. Blinken and Austin, in their first trip abroad under Biden's leadership , arrived in Japan on Tuesday and will travel to South Korea on Wednesday. The pair plans to reaffirm U.S. commitments in the region and discuss ongoing security challenges, including North Korea. "To reduce the risks of escalating, we reached out to the North Korean government channels, starting in mid-February, including in New York. To date we have not received a response from Pyongyang," Blinken said during a news conference on Tuesday. "This follows over a year without active dialogue with North Korea despite multiple attempts by the United States." When asked about Kim's remarks on Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the Biden administration did not have "a direct comment or response." But she went on to say, " Our objective is always going to be focused on diplomacy and denuclearization in North Korea. Our focus right now is on working with and coordinating with our partners and allies on a range of issues and including security in the region." Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on the Biden administration not to let up on the crippling economic pressure placed on North Korea. "I hope that this administration will engage with North Korea with the same massive sanctions regime that we did, which put real pressure on Chairman Kim to come to the table," Pompeo told Fox Business on Sunday . "We made some good progress. We didn't get all the way. We got them to cease long-range missile testing, a big deal for the United States of America and our security," he added. The Trump administration made some initial progress with North Korea, but the negotiations broke down more than a year ago after the U.S. refused to grant sanctions relief in exchange for Pyongyang's dismantling of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. The Biden administration has tried unsuccessfully to restart nuke talks with North Korea. Under third-generation North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the reclusive state has conducted its most powerful nuclear test, launched its first-ever intercontinental ballistic missile and threatened to send missiles into the waters near the U.S. territory of Guam. Since 2011, Kim has launched more than 100 missiles and conducted four nuclear weapons tests, which is more than what his father, Kim Jong Il, and grandfather, Kim Il Sung, launched over a period of 27 years.
The nation's top diplomat slammed China's sweeping use of "coercion and aggression" on the international stage and warned that the U.S. will mount pushback if necessary. "We're united in the vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, where countries follow the rules, cooperate whenever they can, and resolve their differences peacefully. And in particular, we will push back if necessary when China uses coercion or aggression to get its way," Blinken said. Blinken's comments come a handful of days before he and national security advisor Jake Sullivan hold high-level, in-person talks with Chinese representatives.	WASHINGTON — From Japanese soil, Secretary of State Antony Blinken slammed China's sweeping use of "coercion and aggression" on the international stage and warned that the U.S. will mount pushback if necessary. "China uses coercion and aggression to systematically erode autonomy in Hong Kong, undercut democracy in Taiwan, abuse human rights in Xinjiang and Tibet, and assert maritime claims in the South China Sea that violate international law," Blinken said at a news conference. "We're united in the vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, where countries follow the rules, cooperate whenever they can, and resolve their differences peacefully. And in particular, we will push back if necessary when China uses coercion or aggression to get its way," he added. Blinken's comments come a handful of days before he and national security advisor Jake Sullivan hold high-level, in-person talks with Chinese representatives . Blinken and Sullivan will meet with the People's Republic of China's Yang Jiechi, a member of the Communist Party's top decision-making body, and Wang Yi, the foreign minister, in Alaska. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Tuesday that Beijing hopes that a stronger U.S.-Japan relationship will not harm others in the region. "We think the cooperation and communication between Japan and the U.S. should strengthen regional understanding and trust, should be beneficial to cooperation among countries in the region and beneficial to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and that it shouldn't target any third party or harm the interests of any third party," he said during a news conference, according to an English translation. President Joe Biden, who spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping last month , has previously said that his approach to China would be different from his predecessor's in that he would work more closely with allies in order to mount pushback against Beijing. "We will confront China's economic abuses," Biden said in a speech at the State Department , describing Beijing as America's "most serious competitor." "But we're also ready to work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so. We'll compete from a position of strength by building back better at home and working with our allies and partners." In February, Biden announced a new Defense Department task force aimed at assessing the U.S. military's China strategy. "That's how we'll meet the China challenge and ensure the American people win the competition in the future," Biden said in his first visit as commander in chief to the Pentagon . The nation's top diplomat and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday in an effort to shore up alliances and reaffirm commitments with key U.S. partners in the region. On Wednesday the pair will travel to Seoul where they plan to discuss security cooperation and challenges largely posed by China and North Korea. Blinken and Austin's joint trip is the first overseas travel for the two under Biden . Also on Tuesday, North Korea broke its silence for the first time since Biden became president and sent an aggressive message to the United States. "We take this opportunity to warn the new U.S. administration trying hard to give off [gun] powder smell in our land," Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said, referencing joint U.S. and South Korean military exercises in the region. "If it [the U.S.] wants to sleep in peace for coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step," she added, according to an English translation. The Biden administration has tried unsuccessfully to restart nuclear talks with North Korea.

Since 2011, Kim has launched more than 100 missiles and conducted four nuclear weapons tests, which is more than what his father, Kim Jong Il, and grandfather, Kim Il Sung, launched over a period of 27 years. He has not conducted any missile tests since Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20.
Multiple Chinese embassies issued statements on how China would facilitate entry into the country for people who have been vaccinated using Chinese vaccines. To be clear, people who have not been vaccinated with Chinese vaccines can apply to enter China, but will need stronger reasons or specific documents.	China is making it easier for foreigners who have been inoculated with Chinese-made coronavirus vaccines to enter the country, after shutting its borders for international travel more than a year ago due to Covid-19. Multiple Chinese embassies around the world — including those in the United States , United Kingdom , India,  Israel and the Philippines — issued notices on Monday outlining how foreigners can go about applying for visas to enter China. But the instructions only apply to those who have been fully vaccinated using Covid-19 vaccines made in China and have the vaccination certificate to prove it. To be clear, people with valid residence permits can enter China without new visas. Those without Chinese vaccines can also apply for visas, but they will need stronger reasons or specific documents in order to meet the requirements. Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, weighed in on possible reasons for China's move. "Vaccine nationalism is a possibility that cannot be ruled out given the absence of further explanation," he told CNBC in an email. Chong also said some observers suggest this is a way for China to get more usage and recognition of its vaccines or get countries to approve their vaccines more quickly. China has developed five vaccines, and 34 countries have approved at least one Chinese vaccine, according to CNBC's calculations based on a Covid-19 vaccine tracking site . For comparison, the Pfizer - BioNTech shot has been approved by 72 countries, while the Oxford- AstraZeneca vaccine has been approved in 74 countries. Chinese vaccines have been met with some skepticism as information is less readily available compared to those produced by western pharmaceutical companies. Covid-19 was first reported in the China, in the city of Wuhan, before it spread to the rest of the world. The coronavirus is mostly under control in China now, but the country's borders have remained largely closed to foreigners. Each embassy's notice differed in wording, but generally, foreigners from certain countries who have been fully vaccinated with Chinese vaccines require fewer documents to apply for visas. They are also allowed into the country for more reasons — though tourism is not one of them. For example, the Chinese embassy in the United Kingdom said those applying to enter for business purposes will no longer need to produce an invitation letter from provincial governments or departments of commerce. Those without a Chinese vaccine will still need to produce an invitation letter in order to apply, based on visa requirements announced in November. China also expanded the scope of those eligible to apply for a visa for humanitarian purposes. Those from the U.K. seeking to enter the country to reunite with family can now submit an application if they have taken the Chinese shots. Without the Chinese vaccine, foreigners from the U.K. can only apply to enter if a family member is in critical condition and in need of care, or if they needed to arrange for funeral matters in China. The country's quarantine measures of up to 21 days still apply where relevant and negative Covid tests will need to be presented. Applicants should wait 14 days after receiving a Chinese-made vaccine before seeking a visa to enter China.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan will hold high-level, in-person talks on Thursday with China's Yang Jiechi and foreign minister Wang Yi. Blinken, who is visiting Japan and South Korea ahead of Thursday's meeting, fired a salvo against Beijing over Hong Kong, Taiwan, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and Tibet. The two countries are searching for a new strategic narrative to govern their bilateral relationship, which has become highly competitive due to the shifting balance of power between Washington and Beijing, according to Rudd.	The meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials this week in Alaska is unlikely to produce any major breakthroughs, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said Wednesday on CNBC's " Street Signs Asia. " U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan will hold high-level, in-person talks on Thursday with China's Yang Jiechi, a member of the Communist Party's top decision-making body, and Wang Yi, the foreign minister. It will be the Biden administration's first high-level meeting with Chinese officials. "It's more likely to be a dialogue about dialogue rather than substantive problem-solving," said Rudd, who is now president and CEO of Asia Society. Blinken, who is visiting Japan and South Korea — Washington's two biggest military allies in Asia — ahead of Thursday's meeting fired a salvo against Beijing over Hong Kong, Taiwan, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and Tibet . Those issues are likely to be big topics of conversation when the two groups meet in Alaska, according to experts. The U.S.-China relationship frayed over the past four years as the Trump administration blamed Beijing for a wide range of grievances, including: intellectual property theft, unfair trade practices as well as the coronavirus pandemic, which was first reported in China. The two countries are searching for a new strategic narrative to govern their bilateral relationship, which structurally has become "more problematic" due to the shifting balance of power between Washington and Beijing, according to Rudd. He explained that China's rising influence has made the two superpowers fierce rivals in areas of trade, investment, technology, capital markets, influence as well as ideology. "It's competitive, whether we like it or not," Rudd said. "However, at the same time, there are domains in each country which warrant cooperation, like climate change, like pandemics and like, frankly, global debt management." Going forward, the two countries could identify those avenues for cooperation, while also taking note of areas of competition and the other party's red lines, the former prime minister said. That could potentially prevent the competitive relationship from escalating into open conflict. President Joe Biden has said that his approach to China would be different from his predecessor, Donald Trump, and that his administration would work closely with allies to push back against Beijing. Last Friday, Biden virtually met with leaders of India, Japan and Australia as part of an informal strategic alliance known as the Quad . The U.S. is off to a good start in terms of mending some of those alliances in Asia, according to Victor Cha, senior advisor and Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS). "Quite frankly, for allies, Japan and South Korea, the United States was speaking a language over the last four years that they really did not understand," Cha told CNBC's " Squawk Box Asia " on Wednesday. "All these alliance relationships during those four years had been boiled down to how much money allies are willing to pay for U.S. security and that was it. Aside from that, these allies were seen as economic enemies and as liabilities in terms of U.S. power. They were not seen, traditionally, as they are — as assets of U.S. power," he said. Rudd explained that the thinking in Beijing is that it will take the U.S. a long time to rebuild alliances after effectively walking away from them under the previous administration. But if the Biden administration "succeeds in entrenching America's position again in the region and with other allies, then the Chinese may have a more formidable challenge than at present they necessarily assume."
Tai would become the first Asian American woman and the first woman of color to be the U.S. Trade Representative since the position was created nearly 60 years ago. In several instances between 2007 and 2014, she successfully argued the U.S. case against China's trade practices before the World Trade Organization.	Katherine Tai, a critic of China's trade practices, was confirmed Wednesday as the Biden administration's top trade official. The Senate vote was 98-0. Tai, whose parents were born in mainland China, would become the first Asian American woman and the first woman of color to be the U.S. Trade Representative since the position was created nearly 60 years ago. She received unanimous support on Tuesday from an evenly split Senate in a procedural vote clearing her way for confirmation. Tai's expected confirmation comes as the Biden White House attempts to move away from the Trump administration's more belligerent tone in dealing with China, while maintaining a tough U.S. stance against its rival economic superpower. Tai has been critical of certain Chinese policies . In several instances between 2007 and 2014, she successfully argued the U.S. case against China's trade practices before the World Trade Organization. "There are also a lot of areas that are gray areas, where the rules are not clear, or where we don't have rules yet," Tai said last month. She also believes the U.S. should work with other countries to counter China. Tai will succeed Robert Lighthizer, who as Trump's top trade negotiator imposed several tariffs on Chinese imports while negotiating the phase one trade deal the two nations struck in January 2020. When she testified before the the Senate Finance Committee in February, Tai said she wanted to hold China to its phase one commitments. She didn't say whether she would use additional tariffs against China, but noted there were "legitimate tools in the trade toolbox." —CNBC's Thomas Franck contributed to this report.
Asian American leaders and activists are poised to testify about the rise in discrimination and violence against their communities amid the coronavirus pandemic. A House subpanel on civil rights will hear from Sen. Tammy Duckworth and other lawmakers, as well as experts and advocates for Asian Americans. Also on the witness list is actor Daniel Dae Kim, best known for his roles in "Lost" and "Hawaii Five-0," who has previously spoken out against the growing problem of anti-Asian violence. Some advocates have blamed former President Donald Trump's rhetoric for stoking discrimination against Asian Americans.	A bevy of Asian American leaders and activists on Thursday testified before a House panel on civil rights about the rise in discrimination and violence against their communities amid the coronavirus pandemic . The 10 a.m. hearing will consider ways to prevent racially motivated attacks as it examines both the historic and more recent forms of discrimination felt by Asian Americans, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a press release. "There has been a long history of anti-Asian racism in the United States, especially during times of social or economic unrest," Nadler said. "Unfortunately, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, this bigotry has reared its ugly head once again." The hearing comes amid skyrocketing reports of incidents against Asian Americans. It also comes days after a shooting spree at three spas in and around Atlanta, Georgia , that killed eight people, six of whom were reportedly Asian women. There is "legitimate concern that these killings may have been racially motivated," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor Wednesday morning. "There is bigotry in the land, and far too much of it," Schumer added, lamenting that "a sort of superego that puts these things down seems to have weakened, and the id seems to have strengthened." The livestreamed hearing before the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties included testimony from multiple Asian American lawmakers, including Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., the first Thai American woman elected to Congress . The other lawmakers were Reps. Doris Matsui and Judy Chu of California, and Grace Meng of New York. Additional witnesses included leaders of Asian American advocacy groups, such as Asian Americans Advancing Justice and the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council. Also on the list are attorney Wencong Fa of the Pacific Legal Foundation and Charles Lehman of the Manhattan Institute, as well as three university professors. Actor and producer Daniel Dae Kim, best known for his roles on the smash-hit television series "Lost" and "Hawaii Five-0," was also a witness. Kim has previously spoken out against the growing problem of anti-Asian violence, blaming in part the incendiary rhetoric of former President Donald Trump , who repeatedly referred to Covid as the "China virus" despite a barrage of criticism that such language is racially charged. "There's no question that his rhetoric, in my mind, had an effect, but there are a number of politicians who followed in those footsteps," Kim told USA Today earlier this month. "To blame one person doesn't do justice to the situation. It's really about the disrespect that was shown to an entire group of Americans," he added in that interview. "This is what I think is most important in all of this: You might have your problems with the Chinese government and you might even have problems with certain Chinese people, but the people being attacked are Americans in America who often have no connection to China, and especially the Chinese government." Trump, since leaving office after one term, has continued to refer to Covid-19 as the "China virus." Reported hate crimes against Asian Americans have surged since the virus, which experts believe originated in China's central city of Wuhan, grew into a pandemic last March . The advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate said Tuesday that it received 3,795 reports of hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders between March 19, 2020, and Feb. 28, 2021. The group said in a press release that those reported incidents "represent only a fraction of the number of hate incidents that actually occur, but it does show how vulnerable Asian Americans are to discrimination, and the types of discrimination they face." Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have called on Congress to pass legislation aimed at improving hate-crime reporting and to provide more support to victims. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have both spoken out about the rise in attacks on Asian Americans. "Too often, we've turned against one another," Biden said last week in a speech marking the one-year anniversary of the pandemic . The president decried "vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans, who have been attacked, harassed, blamed, and scapegoated," saying, "it's wrong, it's un-American, and it must stop." Harris in mid-February vowed that the Biden administration would "continue to commit ourselves to combating racism and discrimination." Biden signed an executive order on Jan. 26 targeting xenophobia against Asian Americans. Advocates applauded the move, but maintained that it is not enough . "This dark chapter in American history is a moment when accountability and action are required to bring about justice and peace," California's Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus said .
Asia's share of global exports increased in the third and fourth quarters last year, due mainly to China, while the export share of North American nations didn't recover, according to new research. A big part of this disparity is due to the economic recovery in the United States and other wealthy nations. The data comes as the U.S. enacts new stimulus measures and the Biden administration seeks to reset relations with China.	The economic recovery in the United States and other wealthy nations helped China's exports bounce back in a big way last year, according to new research. Asia's share of global exports increased in the third and fourth quarters last year, due mainly to China, while the export share of North American nations didn't recover, according to data from transport and logistics research firm MDS Transmodal. A big part of this disparity is due to increased demand from wealthy countries, including the United States, for Chinese goods. "The increase in global trade was mainly driven by China, which has not only retained the title of 'factory of the world,' but improved its position," said Antonella Teodoro, senior consultant at MDST. MDST calculated that Chinese exports led the world with a year-over-year increase of 3.5% in the third quarter. The growth was even bigger in the fourth quarter: 14%. Trade with China is a key concern for global markets. While China did buy agriculture exports as it promised under the phase one trade deal with the Trump administration, the volumes of the agreed trade were never met. The Biden administration, likewise, is looking to reset U.S.-China trade relations. China critic Katherine Tai will be Biden's U.S. trade representative . Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan will meet with Chinese officials Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi Thursday in Anchorage, Alaska. Wealthy countries' stimulus efforts, designed to combat the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, also played a role in the export disparities in the second half of the year, Teodoro said. "The increase has been supported by the emergency fiscal and monetary stimulus put in place by the wealthy economies," Teodoro said, noting that trade shipping from east to west drove growth. Meanwhile, she added, smaller stimulus efforts in developing nations probably explains much of the lower overall trade volumes. "The shift in consumer spending from travel, vacation and entertainment events to physical goods, mainly bought online, has characterized all the major western economies, in particular the North American countries," Teodoro added. Some of these pandemic buys included bicycles, ATVs and motorbike exports from China. According to MDST, imports of these items increased about 200% during the third and fourth quarters. Exports of kitchen appliances and home office electronic machines and equipment grew by 50% during the same time frame. Gym equipment also had a big surge last year. "With consumers confined to their homes for much of 2020 amid coronavirus lockdown procedures, it comes as little surprise to see that the increase in Chinese exports in the final quarter of 2020 was driven largely by gym equipment which more than doubled," said Teodoro. Based on the volumes of trade transported by SEKO US, there is a direct correlation to the stimulus checks and the surge in e-commerce spending. Rick Lee, SEKO Logistics COO of North America, told CNBC they saw e-commerce orders increase by more than 100% after the first wave of stimulus checks. The company also saw order volumes increase after the second stimulus check. "We are expecting similar consumer behavior with the third round of stimulus," Lee said. The data about increased Chinese exports come as a CNBC analysis found that carriers rejected at least $1.3 billion in agricultural exports at U.S. ports in the second half of last year. The Federal Maritime Commission is investigating whether carriers violated the U.S. Shipping Act by sending empty containers back to China instead of loading them with U.S. goods. The act prohibits nondiscriminatory regulatory processing by the carriers for the movement of goods by water. The carrier's empty container preference is driven by economics. The price per container on the China to U.S. route ($4,571) is more profitable than the U.S. to China route ($715). Time is also a factor. Containers holding agriculture must be cleaned between loads. "Q4 Far East imports from North America grew only marginally versus 2019, with declines to both Japan and South Korea," explained Mike Garratt, Chairman of MDS Transmodal. The shift in containerized trade has some U.S. agriculture exporters moving more of their commodities to their Chinese customers by bulk container. Yet after strong bulk exports in the fall, U.S. soybean exports are dropping as China turns to Brazil for its soybean harvest. U.S. corn bulk exports remain very strong, however. "While soybean shipments show weakness, the corn coming out of the U.S. Gulf continue to show strength," said Jesper Buhl of grain markets analysis publication BullPositions.
China is a large consumer of major commodities including crude oil and iron ore, but it relies heavily on imports to meet its domestic demand for those commodities. The country is diversifying its supply of critical natural resources by buying overseas companies and pivoting toward "stable autocratic regimes" for imports, said a report by Verisk Maplecroft. "By securing diversified sources, China will be in a better position to weaponise trade with geopolitical rivals," the risk consultancy said.	China is diversifying its supply of critical natural resources —  a move  that will shore up Beijing's ability to weaponize trade against its geopolitical rivals, according to a newly published report by risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. "If China has a soft underbelly, it is its high dependency on foreign natural resources," read the report released on Thursday. China is a large consumer of major commodities including crude oil and iron ore. But the country relies heavily on imports to meet its domestic demand for those commodities. One way the country is diversifying its import sources is by buying stakes in overseas companies, said Verisk Maplecroft. Doing that will increase the proportion of Chinese-owned resources in the country's total imports, the report said. As an example, the consultancy said the number of Chinese-owned base metals and gold companies in Oceania  rose from zero in the year 2000 to 59 last year. It represented around 22.6% of total foreign ownership in such companies, the report showed. Oceania is a region that includes Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Fiji and numerous island nations. "China is seeking to strengthen its control over global supply chains via overseas investments and partnerships with international majors. Beijing has been supporting Chinese SOEs [state-owned enterprises] to 'go global' and establish control of resource bases overseas since the late 1990s," said the report. China imports critical commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, metallurgical coal and iron ore from a "highly concentrated" group of trading partners, said Verisk Maplecroft. In diversifying its import sources, China prefers suppliers from "stable autocratic regimes" to democracies that may involve frequent changes in governments or potential shifts in policy, it added. "Our data shows China is pivoting towards more autocratic regimes that represent greater stability for its supply lines than democracies that are, or may become, hostile to Beijing. But it is also using its massive market as a source of diplomatic leverage," the consultancy said. "By securing diversified sources, China will be in a better position to weaponise trade with geopolitical rivals, while at the same time increasing the economic dependence of new and existing partners," it said. But democratic countries dominate the production of some resources — one of them is iron ore. China's largest supplier of iron ore last year was Australia, an American ally that was recently hit by Beijing's trade restrictions. Australia shipped a monthly average of 60.86 million tonnes of iron ore to China in 2020, accounting for more than 60% of overall Chinese imports of the commodity, Refinitiv data showed. That's why China has been strengthening trade ties with other iron ore producers such as Brazil and Guinea, according to the Verisk Maplecroft report. "Despite a tougher line on Beijing under President Bolsonaro, Brazil remains a priority in China's diversification strategy, while Guinea is politically well disposed to Beijing amid democratic backslide," the report said. China is by far Australia's largest trading partner in goods and services, accounting for 39.4% of goods exports and 17.6% of services exports between 2019 and 2020, research firm Capital Economics said. Beijing has shown that it's willing to use trade as a geopolitical lever, according to the Verisk Maplecroft report. The report cited the example of China banning Australian coal . Relations between the two countries soured after Australia supported a call for an international inquiry into China's handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, which first emerged in the city of Wuhan. Coal was just one of the Australian exports hit by Chinese retaliatory measures  that ranged from tariffs to bans and restrictions. Such geopolitical tensions could persist as China speeds up its effort to reduce its reliance on "unfriendly" resource suppliers, said Verisk Maplecroft. "Banning imports of coal from Australia was a prime example but more are likely to follow, with significant impacts on the trade in global commodities and the geopolitical landscape likely," it said. "Companies and investors are in the direct sights of Beijing's diplomatic moves and will need to prepare accordingly."
In less than a year, more than 1 million users have signed up for "BangNiTou," a smartphone-based investment advisory product run through Vanguard's joint venture with Alibaba-affiliate Ant Group. That's according to a release from BangNiTou on Thursday, just four days after Vanguard said it would drop its own pursuit of a mutual fund license in China. Foreign financial institutions received a long-awaited green light last year to take full ownership of local Chinese businesses in futures, mutual fund management and securities.	BEIJING — Vanguard's experiment with financial technology in China is showing early signs of success. In less than a year, more than 1 million users have signed up for "BangNiTou," a smartphone-based investment advisory product run through the American mutual fund giant's joint venture with Alibaba -affiliate Ant Group. That's according to a release from BangNiTou on Thursday, just four days after Vanguard said it would drop its own pursuit of a mutual fund license in China. Instead, the company plans to focus on its partnership with Ant. Ant operates Alipay — one of the two dominant mobile payment apps in China — on which BangNiTou sits. The Vanguard-branded product means "help you invest" in Chinese and launched in April 2020. It is a form of robo-advising , automated financial planning that uses data analytics to determine how a customer should invest based on factors such as age and income. While such automated investing products have surged in popularity in the U.S., the concept of personal finance — whether through human or automated advisors — is still far less common in China. Most locals save heavily for an investment in the housing market or for medical treatment in the case of severe illness. That's partly the result of limited rollout of health insurance, stock market volatility and high minimums for fund investment. For BangNiTou, the minimum investment is 800 yuan ($123), roughly 10% of the officially reported average monthly wage in cities. In July, Vanguard told the Financial Times that new customers were allocating a significantly higher amount, about $1,575 on average for a total of $315 million in assets across 200,000 users. Updated figures weren't available. "While BangNiTou's number of users has been increasing rapidly, the fund investment advisory market in China is still at a nascent stage with significant potential for further growth," Peter Zhang, CEO of the Vanguard joint venture with Ant, said in a statement. Foreign financial institutions received a long-awaited green light last year to take full ownership of local Chinese businesses in futures, mutual fund management and securities. It's not clear what rules might apply in financial technology, or fintech. Vanguard's joint venture with Ant launched in late 2019. Ant holds the majority stake at 51%, according to Chinese business database Qichacha. The Alibaba-affiliated company claims about 1 billion users worldwide. It became an early player in China's wealth management industry with its Alipay-linked money market fund "Yu'e bao," which had around 1.7 trillion yuan in assets under management at its peak in early 2018. Late last year, Chinese authorities abruptly suspended Ant's plans for what would have been the largest initial public offering to date. Beijing has subsequently increased its regulation on fintech and said the industry should be subject to the same rules as banks.
Michael Tien, a Hong Kong lawmaker who's pro-Beijing, said he supports the planned overhaul to the semi-autonomous region's electoral system. "Since 2014-2015, the quality of LegCo and the way it's functioning (have) deteriorated rapidly," said Tien, referring to Hong Kong's Legislative Council. Beijing last week approved a draft decision to alter the size and composition of Hong Kong's legislative body and the election committee that selects the city's leader.	One Hong Kong lawmaker told CNBC he supports China's plan to overhaul the semi-autonomous region's electoral system, arguing that there's been a lack of "rational debate" in the legislature. "Since 2014-2015, the quality of LegCo and the way it's functioning (have) deteriorated rapidly," Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing lawmaker,  told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Thursday. LegCo is short for Legislative Council, which is Hong Kong's legislature. Tien, a Hong Kong deputy to China's parliament National People's Congress, said there's been a lack of "rational debate" in the legislature and the political divide in the chamber has hindered the government from passing bills. "So that touches upon whether the system we have really (has) the final objective of ensuring prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. And at the end, the central government decided that enough is enough — that's the message I received repeatedly," he added. Beijing last week approved a draft decision to alter the size and composition of Hong Kong's legislative body and the election committee that selects the city's leader. Representatives from the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council were in Hong Kong this week to gather feedback about those proposals. Critics have said that the changes will hold back pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong. Changes to Hong Kong's electoral system will come nearly a year  after China bypassed the city's legislature to implement a controversial national security law . The law came after Hong Kong witnessed months of pro-democracy protests that sometimes turned violent. The U.S. and the U.K. have condemned the proposed changes. U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement last week that "Beijing's decision to impose radical changes to restrict participation in Hong Kong's electoral system constitutes a further clear breach of the legally binding Sino-British Joint Declaration ." The declaration was signed before Hong Kong, a former British colony, was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. It states that Hong Kong will have "a high degree of autonomy," including legislative and independent judicial power. Meanwhile, Washington on Wednesday sanctioned 24 Chinese and Hong Kong officials who allegedly contributed to undermining Hong Kong's autonomy. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the latest move by the U.S. "underscores our deep concern with the National People's Congress March 11 decision to unilaterally undermine Hong Kong's electoral system." In response to Washington's action, the Hong Kong government said Wednesday it is "extremely disappointed" that the new U.S. administration is interfering in the city's affairs, which are internal matters of China. "As the highest organ of state power, the National People's Congress (NPC) has the constitutional authority to make the Decisions to improve the electoral system and safeguard national security in the (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) in March 2021 and May 2020 respectively," said a Hong Kong government spokesperson.
The first high-level gathering of U.S. and Chinese officials under President Joe Biden kicked off with an exchange of insults at a pre-meeting press event Thursday, according to NBC News. The two-day talks are set to conclude Friday. A planned four-minute photo session for the officials to address reporters ended up lasting one hour and 15 minutes due to a frothy exchange, according to NBC News	BEIJING — The first high-level gathering of U.S. and Chinese officials under President Joe Biden kicked off with an exchange of insults at a pre-meeting press event in Alaska on Thursday. A planned four-minute photo session for the officials to address reporters ended up lasting one hour and 15 minutes due to a frothy exchange, according to NBC News. Both the Chinese and U.S. side kept calling the reporters back into the room so they could add remarks. Expectations were already low for the meeting in Anchorage, Alaska, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Yang Jiechi, director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission of the Chinese Communist Party. In his opening remarks, Blinken said the U.S. would discuss its "deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion toward our allies." "Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability. That's why they're not merely internal matters, and why we feel an obligation to raise these issues here today," Blinken said. "I said that the United States relationship with China will be competitive where it should be, collaborative where it can be, adversarial where it must be." Beijing considers issues in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan as part of its domestic affairs, and the officials reiterated at the meeting that China is firmly opposed to foreign interference. Yang said the U.S. side "carefully orchestrated" the dialogue, according to an official translation reported by NBC. "I think we thought too well of the United States, we thought that the U.S. side will follow the necessary diplomatic protocols," Yang said, adding that "the United States does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength." Yang said the U.S. must deal with the Chinese side in "the right way" and reiterated Beijing's call for cooperation. Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has been consolidating its power at home and abroad. In the last year, Beijing has pushed ahead with major trade deals with Asia-Pacific neighbors and the European Union. Chinese authorities have also emphasized their success in quickly controlling the coronavirus pandemic domestically, and their claim of lifting all 1.4 billion people in the country out of poverty — both of which Yang pointed to in his meeting with U.S. officials. "We believe that it is important for the United States to change its own image, and to stop advancing its own democracy in the rest of the world," Yang said. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately have a comment. State-run broadcaster CCTV said the U.S. went "seriously overtime" in its opening remarks and "provoked disputes," according to a CNBC translation of the Mandarin-language report. Blinken arrived in Alaska fresh from a trip to Japan and South Korea. He told his Chinese counterparts that what he was hearing from other countries was very different from what Wang described as hopes for demonstrations of goodwill and sincerity between the U.S. and China. "I'm hearing deep satisfaction that the United States is back, that we're reengaged with our allies and partners," Blinken said. "I'm also hearing deep concern about some of the actions your government is taking. And we'll have an opportunity to discuss those when we get down to work." The first round of discussions between the two countries subsequently ended after more than three hours. The two-day talks are set to conclude Friday. Tensions between the U.S. and China escalated in the last few years under former President Donald Trump, who used tariffs and sanctions to address persistent complaints about China's lack of intellectual property protection, requirements of forced technology transfer and other unfair business practices. The dispute initially centered on trade, before spilling over into technology, finance and the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Just as Biden was inaugurated, Beijing announced sanctions on 28 people, including several members of the Trump administration. Days before the first high-level meeting between the two countries, the Biden administration announced sanctions on 24 Chinese officials. Analysts have expected Biden to take a more measured approach and work more closely with U.S. allies in putting pressure on China.
The meeting in Anchorage, Alaska was the first high-level meeting between the two countries under the administration of President Joe Biden, and came after more than two years of rocky relations. What was initially meant to be a four-minute photo shoot ended up lasting more than an hour as both sides traded barbs on issues from U.S.-China relations to concerns from Washington's allies.	Talks between the U.S. and China got off to a rough start on Thursday, with both sides chiding and reprimanding each other in an unusual public display of tensions. The meeting in Anchorage, Alaska was the first high-level meeting between the two countries under the administration of President Joe Biden , and came after more than two years of rocky relations between the two countries. What was initially meant to be a four-minute photo shoot ended up lasting more than an hour as both sides traded barbs on issues from U.S.-China relations to concerns from Washington's allies. Reporters were told not to leave as both sides wanted to add their rebuttals. Leading the U.S. delegation were Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan. Chinese Foreign Minister and State Councilor Wang Yi and Yang Jiechi, director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission of the Chinese Communist Party, led the Chinese delegation. Here are some excerpts and highlights from the meeting: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken: I said that the United States relationship with China will be competitive where it should be, collaborative where it can be, adversarial where it must be. Our discussions here in Alaska, I suspect, will run the gamut. Our intent is to be direct about our concerns, direct about our priorities, with the goal of a more clear-eyed relationship between our countries moving forward. ... I have to tell you in my short time as secretary of State, I've spoken to I think nearly a hundred counterparts from around the world. And I just made my first trip, as I noted, to Japan and South Korea. I have to tell you what I'm hearing is very different from what you described. I'm hearing deep satisfaction that the United States is back, that we're reengaged with our allies and partners. I'm also hearing deep concern about some of the actions your government is taking. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi: China certainly in the past has not and in the future will not accept the unwarranted accusations from the U.S. side. In the past several years, China's legitimate rights and interests have come under outright suppression, plunging the China-U.S. relationship into a period of unprecedented difficulty. ... China urges the U.S. side to fully abandon the hegemony practice of willfully interfering in China's internal affairs. This has been a longstanding issue and it should be changed. It is time for it to change. Chinese Director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission, Yang Jiechi China and the United States are both major countries, and both show the important responsibilities. We must both contribute to the peace, stability and the development of the world, in areas such as Covid-19, restoring economic activities in the world and responding to climate change. There are many things that we can do together and where our interests converge. So what we need to do is to abandon the Cold War mentality and the zero-sum game approach. ... So let me say here that, in front of the Chinese side, the United States does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength. The U.S. side was not even qualified to say such things even 20 years or 30 years back, because this is not the way to deal with the Chinese people. If the United States wants to deal properly with the Chinese side, then let's follow the necessary protocols and do things the right way. Cooperation benefits both sides. In particular, this is the expectation of the people of the world. Well, the American people are certainly a great people, but so are the Chinese people. Blinken: We'll also discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyberattacks on the United States, economic coercion toward our allies. Each of these actions, threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability. U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan: Secretary of State Blinken laid out many of the areas of concerns from economic and military coercion to assault on basic values that we'll discuss with you today and in the days ahead. ... We've heard each of these concerns from around the world, from our allies and partners and the broader international community during the intensive consultations we've undertaken these last two months. We'll make clear today that our overriding priority on the United States side is to ensure that our approach in the world and our approach to China benefits the American people and protects the interests of our allies and partners. We do not seek conflict but we welcome stiff competition and we will always stand up for our principles for our people and for our friends. Yang: It's also important for all of us to come together to build a new type of international relations, featuring fairness, justice, and mutual respect. And on some regional issues, I think the problem is that the United States has exercised long jurisdiction and suppression and over stretched. ... The United States itself does not represent international public opinion and neither does the Western world. Whether judged by population scale or the trend of the world, the Western world does not represent the global public opinion. So we hope that when talking about universal values or international public opinion on the part of the United States, we hope the U.S. side will think about whether it feels reassured saying those things because the U.S. does not represent the world. It only represents the government of the United States. Sullivan: Secretary Blinken and I are proud of the story about America we're able to tell here, about a country that under President Biden's leadership has made major strides to control the pandemic, to rescue our economy and to affirm the strength and staying power of our democracy. We're particularly proud of the work that we've done to revitalize our alliances and partnerships, the foundation of our foreign policy. Yang: And the United States has its style, United States-style democracy. And China has the Chinese-style democracy. It is not just up to the American people, but also the people of the world, to evaluate how the United States has done in advancing its own democracy. In China's case, after decades of reform and opening up, we have come a long way in various fields. ... We believe that it is important for the United States to change its own image and to stop advancing its own democracy in the rest of the world. Many people within the United States actually have little confidence in the democracy of the United States and they have various views regarding the government of the United States in China. Blinken : A hallmark of our leadership, of our engagement in the world is our alliances and our partnerships that had been built on a totally voluntary basis. And it is something that President Biden is committed to reinvigorating and strengthening. And there's one more hallmark of our leadership here at home and that's a constant quest to as we say, form a more perfect union. And that quest, by definition, acknowledges our imperfections acknowledges that we're not perfect. We make mistakes. We, we have reversals we take steps back. But what we've done throughout our history is to confront those challenges, openly, publicly, transparently. Not trying to ignore them. Not trying to pretend they don't exist. Not trying to sweep them under the rug. And sometimes it's painful. Sometimes it's ugly. But each and every time we've come out stronger, better, more united, as a country. I recall well when President Biden was vice president and we were visiting China ... and Vice President Biden at the time said it's never a good bet to bet against America, and that remains true today.
The first U.S.-China meeting under Biden is unlikely to result in any visible compromises, said Heino Klinck, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of Defense for East Asia. The two sides exchanged barbs before the meeting in Anchorage, Alaska officially began, stretching what was meant to be a short photo opportunity into an hour-long dialogue. "It's, for me, unimaginable that the Biden administration is going to look to reset … the relationship as the Chinese would like," he said.	The first U.S.-China meeting under the Biden administration started with "frigid" comments and is unlikely to result in any visible compromises, according to a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of Defense for East Asia. "I would say that the opening statements were certainly frigid, not necessarily due to the ambient temperatures in Alaska," Heino Klinck told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Friday. The two sides exchanged barbs before the meeting in Anchorage, Alaska officially began, stretching what was meant to be a short photo opportunity into an hour-long dialogue. Klinck, now a senior advisor at the National Bureau of Asia Research (NBR), said he was not surprised by the turn of events. "So far, frankly, there are no surprises as far as I can tell," he said. "It's, for me, unimaginable that the Biden administration is going to look to reset … the relationship as the Chinese would like," he said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in his opening remarks that the U.S. would discuss its "deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan." Chinese officials pushed back, repeating that the country is opposed to foreign interference in what it sees as its internal affairs. NBR's Klinck said it is common for U.S. conversations with China to be tense and he has often been lectured by his Chinese counterparts. "We saw a little bit of that on camera today and you saw Secretary Blinken respond," he said. "I think you're going to have more of that in the private discussions." Asked if the meeting could lead to any visible compromises, NBR's Klinck said the short answer is "no." There are areas of potential cooperation such as climate change and public health during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, but he said the U.S. and its partners will "more often than not" compete with China. Washington will also confront Beijing when they cross national security red lines such as targeting the U.S. in cyberattacks or conducting "malign activities" toward U.S. allies. Still, Klinck said it's a "positive sign" that such a high-level meeting is taking place early on in the Biden administration. "Even during the most tense relationships that the United States has had in its history … we would still meet and we would still exchange perspectives, so it's key that we do the same with our strategic competitor China today," he said. "It's important for the senior leaders to be able to meet, discuss things candidly and be able to demonstrate what each national intent is," he added. Gary Locke, a former U.S. ambassador to China, echoed that sentiment. "It sets the tone, it establishes the priorities, the concerns that the United States has," said Locke, who is also interim president at Bellevue College. "Yes, each side made a lot of public, harsh statements and very strong statements, but when they actually sit down and meet face to face, they understand that … they each have a role, but they also need to sit down and figure out a way forward to get past these differences, to solve the fundamental issues," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Friday.
U.S.-China trade relations are likely to remain challenged after this week's diplomatic talks showed that the Biden team will retain a tough tone with Beijing. "I had low expectations for Alaska and those expectations have been met," said attorney Clete Willems, who served as a trade advisor to President Trump. At stake is one of the most valuable relationships in the world. China was the United States' third-largest goods trading partner in 2019 with $558.1 billion in total trade. "The Biden Administration has signaled that trade at all cost is not their position," added Dewardric McNeal, an Obama-era policy analyst at the Defense Department.	The outlook for U.S.-China trade relations is likely to remain challenged after this week's high-level diplomatic talks showed that President Joe Biden's team does not plan to wholly abandon the Trump administration's tough tone in discussions with Beijing. Though Washington and Beijing struck a ceasefire in their tit-for-tat trade feud with last year's "phase one" agreement , representatives on both sides are far from pleased with the status quo and see the other as a key economic rival. That competition was on full display on Thursday , when the countries began two days of meetings in Anchorage, Alaska. Secretary of State Antony Blinken began his remarks by noting that the U.S. would highlight "its deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States [and] economic coercion toward our allies." Yang Jiechi, director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission of the Chinese Communist Party, said the U.S. "does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength." Though the talks were seen more as a diplomatic exercise than an economic one, the prickly exchange is likely an early snapshot of the bitter battles ahead for the Biden trade team. And at stake is one of the most valuable trading relationships in the world. China is currently the United States' third-largest goods trading partner with $558.1 billion in total (two-way) trade in 2019, according to the Office of the USTR . That massive trading volume supported an estimated 911,000 U.S. jobs as of 2015, with 601,000 stemming from goods exports and 309,000 from services exports. China is also the third-largest export market for American farmers and annual trade in agricultural commodities totaled $14 billion two years ago. China is the United States' largest supplier of goods imports. Clete Willems, a former World Trade Organization litigator at the Office of the USTR, told CNBC on Friday that he wasn't surprised at the lack of progress in Anchorage. Willems, who was once a member of Trump's trade team and is now a current partner at law firm Akin Gump, said that the Anchorage meetings were more a chance to officially air complaints and less a realistic attempt at economic remedy. "I had low expectations for Alaska and those expectations have been met," Willems, tongue in cheek, said of the talks. "I think [the Chinese government] misread the situation with the Biden team, and they thought these guys would come in and roll back all the Trump measures," he added. "I think they're finding out that that isn't going to be the case. But I think they need to hear it directly from Blinken." The trade negotiations with China carry commercial importance, but also represent an opportunity to protect U.S. national security interests and shore up access to critical technologies. Weeks before the meetings in Anchorage, Alaska, the Biden administration drafted an executive order directing government departments to review key supply chains, including those for semiconductors, high-capacity batteries, medical supplies and rare earth metals. "The Biden Administration has signaled that trade at all cost is not their position and that they will not curtail their views and pushback on human rights or national security (for example) in order to have a 'good' trade relationship," Dewardric McNeal, an Obama-era policy analyst at the Defense Department, said in an email on Friday. Though Biden's order did not mention China by name, it directed agencies to review gaps in domestic manufacturing and supply chains that are dominated by or run through "nations that are or are likely to become unfriendly or unstable." The directive was widely viewed to include China, one of the globe's largest exporters of rare earths metals, a group of materials used in the production of computer screens, state-of-the-art weapons and electric vehicles. Still, Chinese negotiators, including Foreign Minister Wang Yi, may have been hoping for a warmer reception from Blinken after a tumultuous four years under President Donald Trump and his top diplomat, Mike Pompeo. The Trump administration made a habit of imposing punitive tariffs and sanctions to address persistent complaints about China's lack of intellectual property protection, required technology transfers and other unfair business practices. "The Biden team understand the complex interlinkages of trade and commerce between the two countries and are hoping to be more targeted and predictable in their identification and management of issues and concerns (more surgical and less totally destructive) in competition and in cooperation," McNeal, a senior policy analyst at Longview Global, added on Friday. As of Friday afternoon, the U.S. team in Alaska had made no moves to ease limits on American sales to Chinese firms, including telecommunications giant Huawei, relax visa restrictions on Communist Party members or reopen the Chinese consulate in Houston. Negotiations with Beijing will likely prove a top priority for newly confirmed U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai. The Senate's unanimous vote to confirm her nomination , a first for the Biden administration, reflects bipartisan faith in her skill as a savvy and practiced trade lawyer. "Katherine Tai is just the kind of qualified and mainstream person who is positioned to serve President Biden and the country quite well," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor before the confirmation vote earlier in March. Tai will soon face a litany of trade disputes instigated by the Trump administration but is expected to make discussions with Beijing a top priority . She and her team are expected to review Trump's lingering policies, including duties on Chinese steel, aluminum and consumer goods, as well as components of the phase one deal. "She knows how to be tough on China and she knows how to do it in coordination with others," said Willems, who previously represented the U.S. at the WTO with Tai. He added that it will be important for Tai to be sure to serve as a voice for U.S. trade interests in an administration with a deep diplomatic bench. "You've got an administration with a very strong secretary of state, very strong national security advisors, who are very close to President Biden and who are occupying a lot of oxygen on U.S. policy in general. And she's going to have to punch through that." — CNBC's Nate Rattner and Yen Nee Lee contributed reporting.
The 10-year Chinese government bond yields 3.2%, while the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is much lower at around 1.7%. "U.S. investors continue to be very interested in investing in (the) Chinese market," Tao Wang, head of Asia economics and chief China economist at UBS, said Thursday during a webinar with the Institute of International Finance. "Especially from the bond market perspective, there is a structural increase in the interest." In just two years, foreign holdings of Chinese government bonds have nearly doubled to over 2 trillion yuan ($307.7 billion), according to data from Wind Information.	BEIJING — U.S. investors are among the many foreigners looking to profit from China, particularly its bond market. One clear area of interest is in government bonds, where the Chinese 10-year has a yield of over 3.2%. In contrast, the latest rise in U.S. rates has pushed the 10-year Treasury yield to only 1.7%. That wide difference gives investors in Chinese government bonds a significantly higher return. "U.S. investors continue to be very interested in investing in (the) Chinese market," Tao Wang, head of Asia economics and chief China economist at UBS, said Thursday during a webinar with the Institute of International Finance. "Especially from the bond market perspective, there is a structural increase in the interest." While "China offers high and stable yield," she noted that other countries are still using measures for boosting growth that have resulted in negative yields for many bonds. That means bond buyers will have to pay the issuer when the bond matures, rather than earn money from it. Specific data for U.S. investor holdings wasn't available, but investors outside mainland China held about 3.5% of existing yuan-denominated bond issuance as of the end of February, according to Reuters. Foreign holdings of Chinese government bonds in particular reached about 10.6% of issuance last month, Reuters said. In just two years, foreign holdings of Chinese government bonds have nearly doubled to over 2 trillion yuan ($307.7 billion), according to data from Wind Information. The increased interest comes as Chinese bonds were added to major investment indexes that are tracked by global investors, prompting billions of dollars in Chinese debt purchases. These purchases have grown in the last few months for J.P. Morgan Asset Management's China Bond Opportunities Fund, according to the firm's Asia fixed income portfolio manager Jason Pang. "There's not any clear reason why we shouldn't be disengaged from this particular market," he said. Pang pointed out the Chinese economy is ahead of other countries when it comes to recovery from the coronavirus pandemic , and said the probability of "a much bigger sell-off in China rates is much lower than the rest of the world." As much as international interest in the Chinese bond market has grown, Pang said much of the investments are still in an "experiential phase" as foreign investors still need to learn more about the mainland Chinese market.
The Biden administration on Monday sanctioned two Chinese officials, citing their roles in serious human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. Beijing has previously rejected U.S. charges that it has committed genocide against the Uyghurs, a Muslim population indigenous to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Northwest China. China has also said that allegations of its use of detention camps are groundless and that it instead uses facilities to provide vocational training to help stamp out Islamist extremism and separatism.	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Monday sanctioned two Chinese officials, citing their roles in serious human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. China's Wang Junzheng, the Secretary of the Party Committee of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and Chen Mingguo, director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau, were sanctioned for their connection to "arbitrary detention and severe physical abuse, among other serious human rights abuses targeting Uyghurs," the Department of Treasury said in a statement Monday. Treasury accused China of using repressive tactics for the last five years against Uyghurs and other members of ethnic minorities in the region, including mass detentions and surveillance. "Targets of this surveillance are often detained and reportedly subjected to various methods of torture and "political reeducation," Treasury wrote in a statement. Beijing has previously rejected U.S. charges that it has committed genocide against the Uyghurs, a Muslim population indigenous to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Northwest China. "Amid growing international condemnation, the People's Republic of China (PRC) continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. "We will continue to stand with our allies around the world in calling for an immediate end to the PRC's crimes and for justice for the many victims," the nation's top diplomat added. The sanctions by the Biden administration complement actions also taken today by the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada. China has also said that allegations of its use of detention camps are groundless and that it instead uses facilities to provide vocational training to help stamp out Islamist extremism and separatism. The sanctions come on the heels of a contentious meeting between Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan, and China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and State Councilor Wang Yi in Alaska. Ahead of the talks, Blinken slammed China's sweeping use of "coercion and aggression" on the international stage and warned that the U.S. will push back if necessary. "China uses coercion and aggression to systematically erode autonomy in Hong Kong, undercut democracy in Taiwan, abuse human rights in Xinjiang and Tibet, and assert maritime claims in the South China Sea that violate international law," Blinken said at a news conference in Japan . President Joe Biden, who spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping last month , has previously said that his approach to China would be different from his predecessor's in that he would work more closely with allies in order to mount pushback against Beijing. "We will confront China's economic abuses," Biden said in a speech at the State Department , describing Beijing as America's "most serious competitor." "But we're also ready to work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so," Biden said. "We'll compete from a position of strength by building back better at home and working with our allies and partners."
Worsening tensions between the European Union and China could jeopardize an investment deal that the two sides recently negotiated. The EU imposed sanctions against China for human rights abuses in Xinjiang — Beijing swiftly retaliated with a blacklist of its own. Beijing's response in turn prompted warnings from several members of the European Parliament that they would not ratify the EU-China investment deal that was agreed to in December.	Worsening tensions between the European Union and China could jeopardize an investment deal that the two sides recently negotiated. The EU on Monday imposed sanctions on four Chinese officials and one entity for human rights abuses in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. The move was part of a coordinated action against Beijing by the U.S. and its allies including the U.K. and Canada. China swiftly retaliated against the EU, announcing its own blacklist of 10 individuals — including European lawmakers — and four entities. Beijing's response in turn prompted warnings from several members of the European Parliament or MEPs, saying they would not ratify the EU-China investment deal that was agreed to in December. "The lifting of sanctions against MEPs is a pre-condition for us to enter into talks with the Chinese government on the investment deal," said Kathleen van Brempt , an MEP from the left-leaning Socialist and Democrats group. S&D is the second-largest political grouping in the European Parliament, with 145 MEPs. Those targeted by the Chinese sanctions also weighed in. Reinhard Bütikofer, a German MEP, said in a Twitter post that ratification of the EU-China deal "is not becoming more probable" after Beijing imposed sanctions to "punish" free speech. Bütikofer is a lawmaker from the Greens/European Free Alliance group and chair of the European Parliament's China delegation. Meanwhile, Slovakian MEP Miriam Lexmann from the center-right European People's Party group said in a tweet that China's actions "will make clear that it is not interested in being a partner but rather a systematic rival that undermines fundamental values and principles." The European Parliament is set to vote on the EU-China investment deal in early 2022, said S&D. Negotiations took seven years and the deal, if ratified, would allow European investors "unprecedented access" to the Chinese market, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in December. But even before Monday's retaliatory sanctions, some European lawmakers raised three big concerns about the deal , casting doubt on its passing. Beijing said in a statement that its Vice Foreign Minister Qin Gang summoned Nicolas Chapuis, EU ambassador to China, on Monday night to protest sanctions by the EU. The Mandarin-language statement released on Tuesday said EU sanctions targeted at China were based on "lies and disinformation" about Xinjiang, according to a CNBC translation. It also warned the EU not to further worsen Europe-China relations. Human rights groups like Amnesty International and international organizations including the United Nations have accused China of holding more than 1 million Uyghur Muslims and other minorities in detention camps. In a joint statement released Monday , the U.S. secretary of State as well as the foreign ministers of Canada and the United Kingdom alleged "China's extensive program of repression includes severe restrictions on religious freedoms, the use of forced labour, mass detention in internment camps, forced sterilisations, and the concerted destruction of Uyghur heritage." China has repeatedly denied charges of forced labor, and claimed that the camps are re-education camps to weed out extremism and teach people new job skills. — CNBC's Evelyn Cheng and Silvia Amaro contributed to this report.
In the first coordinated action by Western nations since U.S. President Joe Biden took office, the U.S., EU, U.K. and Canada imposed sanctions on Chinese officials on Monday. The level of detail regarding consequences is different from more vague sanctions in the past, pointed out Nick Turner, a Hong Kong-based of counsel with law firm Steptoe & Johnson. During an annual parliamentary meeting earlier this month, China announced it will advance legislation in foreign affairs, including countermeasures for sanctions.	BEIJING — Rising pressure from major global powers is giving the Chinese government more opportunities to show off its new approach to international affairs. In the first coordinated action by Western nations since U.S. President Joe Biden took office, the U.S., EU, U.K. and Canada imposed sanctions on Chinese officials on Monday. The countries cited human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region of China — accusations Beijing has repeatedly denied. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs quickly responded with its own broad list of sanctions on EU entities and individuals. These people and their families will not be able to enter mainland China, Hong Kong or Macao, and associated companies and institutions will be restricted from doing business with China, according to the ministry. The level of detail regarding consequences as laid out in these sanctions and ones announced just as Biden was being sworn in is different from more vague sanctions in the past, pointed out Nick Turner, a Hong Kong-based of counsel with law firm Steptoe & Johnson. His topic coverage includes economic sanctions. "It demonstrates the natural course of evolution for a major power," Turner said. "We could frame this in terms of only reactions to the West, but ... I think this is a natural course of development." China has grown into the world's second-largest economy in the last two decades. Its leader President Xi Jinping has abolished term limits and pushed for greater control domestically, while allowing the development of a more aggressively-toned diplomatic voice. In July, the foreign ministry also established the Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy research center in Beijing. And during an annual parliamentary meeting earlier this month, China announced it will advance legislation in foreign affairs, including countermeasures for sanctions. Robert Daly, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States, said that in retaliation to the latest sanctions, Beijing could announce similar restrictions on individuals from Canada, U.K. and the U.S. "You'll notice that under Xi Jinping it's become a signature diplomatic move that China will mirror and amplify whatever is done to it, in the way of sanctions," Daly said on CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" Tuesday. — CNBC's Yen Nee Lee contributed to this report.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there's no question China threatens the collective security of NATO allies, particularly when it comes to technology. Blinken said there's still space to cooperate with China, but called for NATO to stand firm when Beijing tries to pressure an alliance member. The top U.S. diplomat also made clear Washington will listen to its allies, a rebuke of the Trump administration's "America First" approach.	WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a strong rebuke Wednesday of China's sweeping use of coercive measures and urged NATO allies to work with the U.S. in order to mount pushback on Beijing. Blinken, in an address at NATO headquarters in Brussels, said the U.S. wouldn't force its European allies into an "us or them choice." However, he made clear that Washington views China as an economic and security threat, particularly in the realm of technology, to NATO allies in Europe. "There's no question that Beijing's coercive behavior threatens our collective security and prosperity and that it is actively working to undercut the rules of the international system and the values we and our allies share," Blinken said after holding two days of consultations with NATO allies. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, is an alliance made up of 30 member nations. The secretary said there is still space to cooperate with China on common challenges like climate change and health security, but called for NATO to stand together when Beijing coerces one of the alliance's members. "We know that our allies have complex relationships with China that won't always align perfectly with ours. But we need to navigate these challenges together. That means working with our allies to close the gaps in areas like technology and infrastructure, where Beijing is exploiting to exert coercive pressure," Blinken said. "When one of us is coerced we should respond as allies and work together to reduce our vulnerability by insuring our economies are more integrated with each other," America's top diplomat said. Blinken called out China's militarization of the South China Sea, use of predatory economics, intellectual property theft and human rights abuses. On Monday, the Biden administration slapped fresh sanctions on two Chinese officials , citing their roles in serious human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. The Department of the Treasury accused China of using repressive tactics for the last five years against Uyghurs and other members of ethnic minorities in the region, including mass detentions and surveillance. "Targets of this surveillance are often detained and reportedly subjected to various methods of torture and 'political reeducation,'" the Treasury wrote in a statement. Beijing has previously rejected U.S. charges that it has committed genocide against the Uyghurs, a Muslim population indigenous to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in northwest China. Blinken's comments come on the heels of a contentious meeting between Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan and China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and State Councilor Wang Yi in Alaska. Ahead of the Alaska talks, Blinken slammed China's sweeping use of "coercion and aggression" on the international stage and warned that the U.S. will push back if necessary. "China uses coercion and aggression to systematically erode autonomy in Hong Kong, undercut democracy in Taiwan, abuse human rights in Xinjiang and Tibet, and assert maritime claims in the South China Sea that violate international law," Blinken said at a news conference in Japan . The tension between Beijing and Washington soared under the Trump administration, which initiated a trade war and worked to ban Chinese technology companies from doing business in the United States. Over the past four years, the Trump administration blamed China for a wide range of grievances, including intellectual property theft, unfair trade practices and recently, the coronavirus pandemic . President Joe Biden , who spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping last month , has previously said that his approach to China would be different from his predecessor's in that he would work more closely with allies in order to mount pushback against Beijing. "We will confront China's economic abuses," Biden said in a speech at the State Department , describing Beijing as America's "most serious competitor." "But we're also ready to work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so," the president said. "We'll compete from a position of strength by building back better at home and working with our allies and partners." Blinken, the first Biden Cabinet-level official to visit NATO, reiterated the U.S. commitment to the world's most powerful alliance. "We need to be able to have these tough conversations and even to disagree while still treating one another with respect. Too often in recent years, we in the U.S. seem to have forgotten who our friends are. That has already changed," Blinken said, without mentioning the "America First" policy championed by the Trump administration. Former President Donald Trump frequently dressed down NATO members throughout his presidency and had previously threatened to leave the alliance. In December 2019, Trump told NATO leaders in London that too many members were still not contributing enough financially and threatened to reduce U.S. military support if allies do not increase spending. Trump singled out German Chancellor Angela Merkel for not meeting the 2% of GDP spending goal set at the 2014 NATO summit in Wales. Germany, at the time, was only one of 19 NATO members that had not met the 2% GDP spending goal set at the 2014 summit. Blinken recognized the testy trans-Atlantic relationship over defense finances and called for a "more holistic view of burden sharing." "We recognize the significant progress many of our NATO allies have made in improving defense investments," he said, adding that "no single number fully captures a country's contribution to defending our collective security and interests, especially in a world where a growing number of threats cannot be confronted with military force." "We must acknowledge that because allies have distinct capabilities and comparative strengths, they will shoulder their share of the burden in different ways," Blinken said.
Facebook said on Wednesday it had blocked a group of hackers from China who were using malicious websites to infect the devices of Uyghur Muslims living abroad in order to enable surveillance. The hacking group — known as Earth Empusa or Evil Eye — used a variety of techniques to infect their targets' devices. Facebook did not link the blocked China hacking group to the Chinese government.	GUANGZHOU, China — Facebook said Wednesday it had blocked a group of hackers from China who were using malicious websites to infect the devices of Uyghur Muslims living abroad to enable surveillance. The hacking group — known as Earth Empusa or Evil Eye — used a variety of techniques to infect their targets' devices, said the social media company. In one example, the hackers set up malicious websites that used look-alike domains for popular Uyghur and Turkish news sites, Facebook said. If a user visited those sites, their device could be infected with code that would enable the hackers to surveil the device. The ethnic Uyghurs mostly live in the region of Xinjiang in north-western China. They have been identified by the United Nations, United States , United Kingdom and others as a repressed group. Authorities allegedly use widespread surveillance technology to monitor the Uyghur population — allegations that the Chinese government denies. Facebook did not link the blocked China hacking group to the Chinese government. The tech giant said the hackers also appeared to have compromised legitimate websites that were visited frequently by their targets. The hackers also used fake accounts on Facebook to "create fictitious personas posing as journalists, students, human rights advocates or members of the Uyghur community to build trust with people they targeted and trick them into clicking on malicious links." Facebook said it found websites designed to look like third-party Android app stores "where they published Uyghur-themed applications, including a keyboard app, prayer app, and dictionary app." Any apps downloaded from these sites contained malicious software to infect devices. The Chinese hacking group targeted activists, journalists and dissidents, predominantly among Uyghurs from Xinjiang in China who mostly live abroad in Turkey, Kazakhstan, the United States, Syria, Australia, Canada and other countries, Facebook said. The intention was to "infect their devices with malware to enable surveillance." Facebook said it blocked malicious website domains from being shared on its platform and took down the hacking group's accounts in order to disrupt it activity. The U.S. social network said it also notified people who it believed were targeted. In their first coordinated move , the U.S., European Union, Britain and Canada jointly imposed sanctions of Chinese officials over China's alleged human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang. "The evidence, including from the Chinese Government's own documents, satellite imagery, and eyewitness testimony is overwhelming," said a joint statement by the U.S., U.K. and Canada . "We are united in calling for China to end its repressive practices against Uyghur Muslims and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, and to release those arbitrarily detained," they said.
H&M faced backlash on Chinese social media service Weibo over a statement reportedly from last year in which the retailer said it was "deeply concerned" about reports of forced labor in Xinjiang. CNBC searches for "H&M" and "hm" in English on Alibaba's Taobao e-commerce site as well as JD.com yielded no results. Nike also faced backlash after a statement surfaced on Chinese social media in which the sports giant said it was "concerned" about reports of forced labor in Xinjiang. Some Chinese celebrities cut ties with Nike.	GUANGZHOU, China — Swedish clothing retailer H&M disappeared from major Chinese shopping sites and mapping apps after resurfaced comments, reportedly from last year, about its concerns over alleged forced labor in China's western region of Xinjiang. A CNBC search for "H&M" and "hm" in English on Taobao, the e-commerce site run by Alibaba , and JD.com yielded no results. Meanwhile, Alibaba-owned mapping app Amap as well as Baidu Maps did not display any results for the search term "H&M." JD.com declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. Alibaba and Baidu were not immediately available for comment. Xinjiang is home to the Uyghur Muslims, who have been identified by the United Nations, United States,  United Kingdom and others as a repressed ethnic group. In their first coordinated move in response to allegations of forced labor, the U.S., European Union, Britain and Canada jointly imposed sanctions on Chinese officials this week over China's alleged human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang. H&M faced backlash from Chinese users on Twitter-like service Weibo who responded to a resurfaced statement by the retailer. Reuters said the statement was from last year . CNBC could not ascertain when the H&M statement was first published. At the time, H&M said it was "deeply concerned by reports from civil society organisations and media that include accusations of forced labour" in Xinjiang, a cotton producing region, according to Reuters . The company said it did not source products from there. That statement appears to have been removed from the Swedish retailer's website. H&M was not immediately available for comment. A joint statement by the U.S., U.K. and Canada this week said that evidence of human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang, "including from the Chinese Government's own documents, satellite imagery, and eyewitness testimony is overwhelming." The countries cited forced labor as one of the features of "China's extensive program of repression," along with mass detentions and forced sterilizations. China has repeatedly denied allegations of forced labor and other abuses in Xinjiang. The government says that facilities there that the U.S., U.K., Canada and human rights groups have characterized as internment camps are actually vocational training centers. Asked at a press conference on Thursday if the Ministry of Commerce had ordered the e-commerce companies to ban companies like H&M, spokesman Gao Feng said: "Regarding some companies' so-called business position on some false information, Chinese consumers have already responded with real actions." "(We) hope the relevant companies can respect market rules, adjust their wrong actions and avoid the politicization of business," he said at the press event, according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks. Gao added that foreign companies are welcome to conduct "normal operations" in China and invest and do business in Xinjiang. It's unclear why the old H&M statement resurfaced. But on Wednesday, a post by China's Communist Youth League on Weibo showed a screenshot of the statement. The post accused H&M of spreading rumors about Xinjiang. The hashtag "support Xinjiang cotton" was the top trending topic on Weibo on Thursday. H&M was not the only international retailer facing the wrath of Chinese web users. Nike is also facing backlash. The U.S. sportswear giant said in a statement it was "concerned about reports of forced labor in, and connected to" Xinjiang. Nike said it does not source products from the region and "confirmed with our contract suppliers that they are not using textiles or spun yarn from" Xinjiang. It is unclear when Nike's statement was published. Chinese actor Wang Yi Bo cut ties with Nike after the online backlash, according to his management agency. Chinese actress Tan Songyun also cut ties with the company. Nike was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. — CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.
North Korea said via state-run media that its recent weapons launch was new tactical-guided missiles. The United States, Japan and South Korea said Wednesday evening that Pyongyang fired off what appeared to be short-range ballistic missiles. On Thursday, Biden warned that there would be "responses" if North Korea continues to launch ballistic missiles.	WASHINGTON – North Korea said via state-run media that its recent weapons launch was new tactical guided missiles. The newly developed weapons, which can carry a warhead of up to 2.5 tons, flew approximately 300 miles over the East Sea, according to unverified North Korean news reports. The United States, Japan and South Korea said Wednesday evening that Pyongyang fired off what appeared to be short-range ballistic missiles, the first ballistic tests from the hermit kingdom in nearly a year . U.S. Navy Capt. Mike Kafka, a spokesman for U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said the U.S. was monitoring the situation and consulting its allies and partners. "This activity highlights the threat that North Korea's illicit weapons program poses to its neighbors and the international community. The U.S. commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea and Japan remains ironclad," Kafka said. On the heels of the North's ballistic missile test, the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee on North Korea will meet on Friday, a spokesperson confirmed to NBC News. The launch of two short-range ballistic missiles run in violation of UN Security Council resolution 1718. Over the weekend, North Korea tested a cruise missile off the nation's west coast , the first weapons test since President Joe Biden took office. Senior administration officials on a Tuesday evening call with reporters would not elaborate on what type of weapon was launched, the location of the test, nor its success rate. On Thursday, Biden warned that there would be "responses" if North Korea continues to launch ballistic missiles. "We are consulting with our allies and partners and there will be responses if they choose to escalate. We will respond accordingly," Biden said in his first formal press conference. "I am also prepared for some form of diplomacy but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization," he added. The multiple tests come as Pyongyang ignores invitations from Washington to discuss denuclearization and as the U.S. and South Korea resume large, joint military exercises. Last week, a top North Korean official said Pyongyang will not respond to numerous invitations to restart nuke talks until the United States drops its " hostile policies ." "We have already declared our stand that no DPRK-U.S. contact and dialogue of any kind can be possible unless the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy towards the DPRK," said First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Choe Son Hui, according to a statement released by state-run Korean Central News Agency. Under Kim Jong Un, the reclusive state has conducted its most powerful nuclear test, launched its first-ever intercontinental ballistic missile and threatened to send missiles into the waters near the U.S. territory of Guam. Since 2011, Kim has launched more than 100 missiles and conducted four nuclear weapons tests, which is more than what his father, Kim Jong Il, and grandfather, Kim Il Sung, launched over a period of 27 years.
A first-quarter survey by the China Beige Book released Thursday found that borrowing by state-owned enterprises dropped to the lowest in the study's roughly 10-year history. Given ties to the state, the government-linked companies are the "best signal" on authorities' policy intent, China Beige Book Managing Director Shehzad Qazi said in a note. While Qazi noted more quarterly data will be needed to tell whether China has fully in a "deleveraging" mode again, there are other signs that authorities are trying to control debt.	BEIJING — Data for the year so far show signs that China is starting to crack down on debt. A first-quarter survey by the China Beige Book released Thursday found that borrowing by state-owned enterprises dropped to the lowest in the study's roughly 10-year history. Overall borrowing fell to its lowest in three years, while that of large firms hit a five-year low, the report said. Given ties to the state, the government-linked companies are the "best signal" on authorities' policy intent, China Beige Book Managing Director Shehzad Qazi said in a note. The company conducts quarterly surveys of businesses in China. Economists note China's relatively low GDP target of over 6% this year gives policymakers the ability to address problems such as high debt levels, without needing to worry too much about growth. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic last year, China had attempted to curb that debt growth with mixed results. While Qazi noted more quarterly data will be needed to tell whether China has fully gone into "deleveraging" mode again, there are other signs that authorities are trying to control debt. China's debt-to-GDP ratio rose to 285% as of the end of the third quarter of 2020, up from an average of 251% between 2016 to 2019, according to a report Monday from Allianz, citing analysis from its subsidiary Euler Hermes. Although that debt-to-GDP ratio has not declined, it has stabilized, senior economist Francoise Huang said in a phone interview Tuesday. "Stabilizing is already a good sign and probably one of the targets of the deleveraging campaign from Chinese policymakers." She pointed out that a nationwide measure of debt called aggregate financing has slowed its growth since October. On a year-to-date, year-on-year basis, aggregate financing to the real economy grew by 44.39% in October but fell off since then, according to data from Wind Information. The figure showed an increase of 16.19% in February. Chinese regulators have warned in the last several weeks about financial risks, particularly in stocks and the property market. Premier Li Keqiang said earlier this month in an annual report on the economy that China has recovered sufficiently from the coronavirus pandemic and no related bond issuance is planned. One concern of this pullback in support is that banks may not be as eager to lend to smaller, privately-run businesses as they were during the pandemic, when Beijing specifically encouraged such lending. China's major banks are state-owned and prefer to work with state-owned enterprises rather than riskier privately run companies. But the private sector contributes to the majority of jobs and growth in China. "I think policymakers want private and especially (small and medium-sized enterprises) to not be concerned by this deleveraging," Huang said. "But I think in the end it may be something that concerns all types of companies." Moody's expects lending growth "will be more moderate this year," particularly since there are new restrictions on lending in real estate-related industries, said Nicholas Zhu, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's Investor Service. He added that China's emphasis on peak carbon emissions in 2030 will generate more demand from companies to finance renewable energy-related projects. But he said banks will be more cautious about extending loans due to experience in the past with Chinese solar companies, many of which went bankrupt.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced sanctions Friday on U.K. entities in response to similar action by Britain on Monday over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The retaliatory move prohibits four entities and nine individuals in the U.K. from doing business with China, and freezes their assets in the country, the foreign ministry said. Earlier this week, the U.K., EU, U.S. and Canada imposed sanctions on Chinese officials, the first coordinated action by Western nations since U.S. President Joe Biden took office.	BEIJING — China slapped sanctions on U.K. entities on Friday , saying that Britain's sanctions on Chinese individuals over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang were based on "lies and disinformation." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs imposed sanctions on four U.K. entities and nine individuals that will be prohibited from doing business with China. Their assets in the country will also be frozen, the ministry said. That's a step further than previous Chinese sanctions on foreign entities . This week's sanctions on European Union entities and those on American politicians in January were focused on prohibiting travel to China and doing business. The new sanctions on the U.K. primarily target individuals involved with human rights, particularly those of the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. Xinjiang is home to the Uyghur Muslims, an ethnic minority that the United Nations, United States,  United Kingdom and others have identified as a repressed group. The U.S., EU, U.K. and Canada on Monday imposed sanctions on Chinese officials , the first coordinated action by Western nations since U.S. President Joe Biden took office. The countries cited human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region of China — accusations Beijing has repeatedly denied. On Thursday, Swedish clothing retailer H&M disappeared from major online shopping sites in China after backlash on Chinese social media over the brand's previous comments over alleged forced labor in Xinjiang. A similar statement from Nike prompted two Chinese celebrities to cut ties with the U.S. sportswear brand.
The Chinese sanctions target the chair and vice chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, Gayle Manchin and Tony Perkins. Canadian parliamentarian Michael Chong and Canada's House of Commons foreign affairs subcommittee on international human rights were also targeted. The sanctions are the latest escalation in a growing dispute between Western nations and Beijing over the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities in China.	China has imposed sanctions against two U.S. religious rights officials, a Canadian member of parliament and a subcommittee on human rights in Canada's House of Commons, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement released Saturday. The sanctions are the latest escalation in a growing dispute between Western nations and Beijing over the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities in China, particularly the province of Xinjiang. The Chinese sanctions target the chair and vice chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, Gayle Manchin and Tony Perkins. The USCIRF has condemned China's treatment of the Uyghur Muslim population in Xinjiang and endorsed recent U.S. sanctions against Chinese officials. The U.S. condemned the sanctions in a late Saturday statement released by the State Department, calling the measures "baseless." "Beijing's attempts to intimidate and silence those speaking out for human rights and fundamental freedoms only contribute to the growing international scrutiny of the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in the statement. Beijing also targeted Canadian MP Michael Chong, who is vice chair of the House of Common's foreign affairs committee. The foreign affairs subcommittee on international human rights was sanctioned as well. The House of Common's foreign affairs committee released a report earlier this month , based on meetings in the subcommittee, that concluded human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims in China amount to crimes against humanity and genocide. The Chinese sanctions prohibit the officials from entering mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao and bans Chinese citizens and institutions from doing business the officials and conducting exchanges with the human rights subcommittee. The sanctions come in response to punitive measures the U.S. placed on two Chinese officials earlier this week. The Biden administration said it imposed those sanctions in response to human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims. The U.S. sanctions targeted China's Wang Junzheng, secretary of the party committee of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and Chen Mingguo, director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau. The two officials were targeted due to their connection to "arbitrary detention and severe physical abuse, among other serious human rights abuses targeting Uyghurs," the Treasury said in a statement Monday. Canada also imposed sanctions against Chinese officials over the treatment of Uyghurs.
Huawei's revenue for 2020 totaled 891.4 billion yuan ($136.7 billion), a 3.8% year-on-year rise in yuan terms. That was slower than the more than 19% revenue growth Huawei saw in 2019. U.S. sanctions and the economic fallout from the coronavirus weighed on the Chinese technology giant. Over the past two years, Huawei has been blocked from 5G rollouts in some countries and faces uncertainty over future semiconductor supply, as a result of U.S. actions.	GUANGZHOU, China — Huawei's revenue growth slowed dramatically last year as the impact of U.S. sanctions and the economic fallout from the coronavirus weighed on the Chinese technology giant. Revenue for 2020 totaled 891.4 billion yuan ($136.7 billion), a 3.8% year-on-year rise in yuan terms. That was slower than the more than 19% revenue growth Huawei saw in 2019. China was the only region where Huawei operates that saw positive revenue growth. Sales in China totaled 584.9 billion yuan ($89.7 billion), up 15.4% year on year and accounting for over 65% of total revenue. In 2020, China's economy grew as the country managed to broadly contain the coronavirus. Other major economies saw contractions as the pandemic continued to sweep across the world and numerous countries enacted lockdowns of varying degrees. Huawei's net profit for 2020 was 64.6 billion yuan ($9.9 billion), up 3.2% year over year. The U.S. has slapped Huawei with a number of sanctions over the last two years. Washington maintains that the Chinese telecommunications giant is a national security threat, a claim that Huawei has repeatedly denied. In 2019, Huawei was put on a U.S. blacklist called the Entity List . This restricted American companies from exporting certain technologies to Huawei. Google ended up cutting ties with Huawei . That meant the Chinese giant could not use Google's Android operating system on its smartphones. That's not a big deal in China where Google services like search and Gmail are blocked. But it hurt Huawei in international markets where consumers are used to these apps. And last year, the U.S. moved to cut Huawei off from key chip supplies it needs for its smartphones. Both measures have damaged Huawei's smartphone sales. At the time of the Entity List inclusion, Huawei was the second-largest smartphone player by market share. But in the fourth quarter, Huawei fell out of the top five biggest vendors by market share as sales around the world plunged. Huawei said its consumer business recorded revenue of 482.9 billion yuan ($74.1 billion), a 3.3% year-on-year rise. That was slower than the 34% growth seen in 2019. Ken Hu, Huawei's rotating chairman, said the results of the consumer business "fell short" of the company's expectations due to a fall in smartphone revenue. "Because of the unfair sanctions placed on us by the U.S., our mobile phone business saw a revenue decline," he said, according to an official English translation of his Mandarin remarks. However, some of Huawei's other products including tablets, laptops, wearables and smart home devices saw an increase in sales that helped offset the smartphone decline, according to Hu. In 2019, Huawei launched its own operating system called HarmonyOS which is designed to work across devices. The company is looking to roll out the operating system across a number of its products and last month announced the software's arrival on its foldable smartphone, the Mate X2 . Huawei is hoping that may help its consumer business. Besides the smartphone business, the U.S. has also looked to target Huawei's telecommunications unit. Under former President Donald Trump's administration, the U.S. sought to push allied countries to block Huawei from their 5G networks. 5G refers to next-generation mobile networks and Huawei is one of the leading companies making telecommunications equipment to support that. Countries including Australia and the U.K. have blocked Huawei from their 5G networks . That, along with a potential slowdown in mobile network spending on equipment last year, is likely the reason behind Huawei's carrier business eking out growth of just 0.2% in 2020. A bright spot for Huawei was its enterprise business which includes products it sells to companies across various industries. This could include cloud computing, which has been a big focus for the company recently. In 2020, the enterprise business brought in revenue of 100.3 billion yuan ($15.4 billion), up 23% year-on-year, making it the fastest-growing of all of Huawei's divisions.
China outspent the U.S. by nearly 2-to-1 on energy transition-related investment between 2010 and 2020, according to BNEF data cited by Bank of America's ESG Research team. China's spending on research and development climbed 10.3% to 2.44 trillion Chinese yuan ($378 billion) in 2020, outpacing the U.S., according to the nation's National Bureau of Statistics. Harry Broadman, an assistant U.S. trade representative during the Clinton administration, said the G-7 group of major economies will need to evolve R&D and science and technology collaborations to compete with China.	Having long been at loggerheads over trade , technology and capital markets , the world's foremost economic superpowers are turning their attention to climate change as the next path to commercial supremacy. China outspent the U.S. by nearly 2-to-1 on energy transition-related investment between 2010 and 2020, according to BNEF data cited by Bank of America's ESG Research team in a report last month. Pressure points including "supply chain dominance, domestic-focused manufacturing policies, human rights-related laws and carbon-related trade tariffs," BofA analysts said. BofA managing director of research Haim Israel said a "climate war" between Washington and Beijing would follow the tech war and trade war as climate change becomes the dominant economic and political theme of the coming decades. "It's not just about saving the planet. We believe climate strategies offer a route to global supremacy, as much more is at stake here: the economic impact of climate could reach $69 trillion this century, and energy transition investment needing to rise up to $4 trillion per year," Israel said in a research note in February. "Energy independence and supply chain control are also at stake with the geopolitical balance of power also linked to peak oil in 2030." Israel told CNBC that the U.S. would look to ramp up legislation, innovation and capital flows into renewable energies such as wind, solar, batteries and hydrogen. "We also see a ramp-up in electric cars. Remember that today, give or take, 50% of all oil in the world is allocated to the transportation market, and cars is a big part of it. So whoever will control EVs and EV technology will definitely have a big advantage going forward," he added. Tensions between the U.S. and China have continued under President Joe Biden's administration, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken conducting terse discussions with Chinese delegates in Alaska last month. Harry Broadman, managing director and chair of the emerging markets and CFIUS practices at Berkeley Research Group, told CNBC last week that developed countries' ability to create, execute and sell products that advance the climate agenda without negatively affecting the labor market would shape the economic landscape in the coming years. "As long as people believe that there is going to be a market for such technologies and that's going to be dictated by how cheap it is, and whether it destroys jobs or creates jobs — it does not necessarily have to destroy jobs at all — that is going to be the driving imperative, and I think that race is already underway," Broadman said. Ahead of the Group of Seven summit in Cornwall, U.K. in June, Broadman, an assistant U.S. trade representative during the Clinton administration, said the group of major economies will need to drastically evolve their research and development and sovereign-to-sovereign science and technology collaborations in order to compete with China. Broadman is pushing for an "R&D7" to be included on the G-7 agenda, similar to other working groups across members on issues of global importance. Its aim would be to reform the structure underlying the negotiation and execution of international science and technology agreements among G-7 countries. It would also form a stand-alone body tasked with ensuring that these agreements strengthen and recalibrate R&D collaboration within the G-7. "We've done really well among democratic countries collaborating on investment and trade, but we've done an extraordinarily poor job in R&D, and this is where China is frankly a huge competitive and potentially a huge economic and maybe geopolitical, threat," he said. China has pledged net-zero carbon emissions by 2060 . Countries operating net-zero pledges currently account for just under half of all global emissions, with China representing around two-thirds of these, according to a recent equity research report from Goldman Sachs. However, this could be a tall order, since China is by far the planet's biggest polluter. The country accounts for around 30% of the world's CO2 emissions, more than twice that of the U.S., and is rated by Climate Action Tracker as "highly insufficient" under the "fair share" principle in combating climate change. Goldman analysts led by equity business unit leader Michele Della Vigna plotted the country's potential path to net zero by sector and technology, laying out the $16 trillion of clean tech infrastructure investments China will need to embark on by 2060. Collectively, these could create 40 million net new jobs and drive economic growth, they projected, and would be based on three interconnected scalable technologies: electrification, green hydrogen and carbon capture. China's spending on research and development climbed 10.3% to 2.44 trillion Chinese yuan ($378 billion) in 2020, outpacing the U.S., according to the nation's National Bureau of Statistics. Meanwhile, Europe is home to eight of the 10 largest "clean tech" companies in the world, with potential for a fourfold increase globally in clean tech capacity by 2030, BofA analysts projected. Investors have also shown growing interest in companies seen as pioneering the energy transition, from electric vehicles to clean energy. As China finds itself "incrementally boxed out" of access to technologies from the U.S. and the rest of the G-7, Broadman suggested that a decoupling on standards would ensue , creating a "China-centered orbit" and a "G7-centered orbit" that would be unsustainable. "There can be only one sort of standard in the world from a pure economic perspective. The economies of scale are so powerful that if you have two co-existing standards, someone is going to lose money," he said. "That's why I think whoever wins that race is going to be on top. That race has begun and the G-7 have not pursued this through collective action, and that is what they have to do. Climate is just an extraordinarily critical case in point."
China's central bank warned on Thursday of financial risks in the country that have accumulated over the years, as well as shocks from overseas uncertainties. The detailed comments mark the latest warning from high-level officials in China in recent weeks about domestic market risks.	BEIJING — China's central bank warned on Thursday of financial risks in the country that have accumulated over the years, as well as shocks from overseas uncertainties. These risks include "oscillation" in the stock and fixed income markets and potential bond defaults in real estate companies, said Zou Lan, director of the People's Bank of China's financial markets department. The detailed comments mark the latest warning from high-level officials in China in recent weeks about domestic market risks. The Shanghai composite is little changed for the year, while the S&P 500 has climbed more than 5% The coronavirus pandemic and high volatility in international capital flows have also shocked the domestic financial market, Zou told reporters. "The stock, bond and commodities markets face oscillation risks," he said, according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks. "A small number of large-scale enterprise groups are still in a period of risks being exposed, middle and low-quality enterprises still face financing difficulties, and the risk of default is rather high." Zou added that pressure from rising house prices in some "hot" cities is relatively large, and the potential of debt default and other risks among highly leveraged medium-sized and small real estate businesses is worth watching. The Chinese government announced last month it will target GDP growth of over 6% this year. Many economists said the conservative target gives policymakers the ability to address long-term problems such as a buildup of debt. China's debt-to-GDP ratio rose to 285% as of the end of the third quarter of 2020, up from an average of 251% between 2016 to 2019, according to a report from Allianz, citing analysis from its subsidiary Euler Hermes. Among signs that authorities have started to get serious about domestic risks, some state-owned enterprises defaulted on their debt last year — very rare for companies that investors believed had implicit government support. But in the housing market, Beijing has struggled to limit speculation. New home prices rose by their fastest rate in five months in February, according to Reuters. Officials from the People's Bank of China at Thursday's press conference maintained that monetary policy would remain stable and supportive. Zou did not give specific details on how the financial risks he mentioned would be addressed.
As China tries to build up its own technology, it looks difficult for other cities to replicate the success of Shenzhen, home to tech giants such as Tencent and Huawei. For example, the city of Xi'an has many similar ingredients for success but has lagged so far as analysts point to the dominance of the state. Shenzhen also benefits from its proximity to Hong Kong.	BEIJING — As growing pressure from the U.S. pushes Beijing to build up its own technology, local systems are getting in the way. Over the past forty years, experimentation with business-friendly policies in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen helped turn it into the equivalent of Silicon Valley with homegrown tech giants such as Tencent and Huawei. But so far, other cities have yet to repeat Shenzhen's success. Meanwhile, national urgency for self-sufficiency in tech is central to a five-year development plan announced in March, with ambitious goals for research and development in seven "frontier" technologies such as semiconductors. The central directive has local governments striving to do their part. A 4.5-hour flight north from Shenzhen, the city of Xi'an has many of the right elements for tech innovation: research or manufacturing centers for semiconductors, aerospace and other high-tech industries; talent from local universities; and significant foreign investment. Both Samsung and U.S. chipmaker Micron have major operations in Xi'an, which was also the fastest growing major city in China last year. Xi'an Mayor Li Mingyuan said in a statement last month to CNBC that tech innovation is at the top of his list for high quality development under Beijing's five-year plan. He said that by 2025, Xi'an aims to achieve output in advanced manufacturing of more than 1 trillion yuan ($153.85 billion) and support more than 10,000 high-tech businesses, for total GDP of more than 1.4 trillion yuan. That's about 40% growth from Xi'an's GDP in 2020. But analysts say the state is stifling Xi'an's potential. The biggest difference between Shenzhen and Xi'an is that businesses form the major part of Shenzhen, while Xi'an needs to reduce the role of the government, said Qu Jian, vice-director of the Shenzhen-based think tank China Development Institute. While each city has to determine its own path, if Xi'an wants to follow that of Shenzhen, then the market needs to play a bigger role, Qu said. Innovation is also difficult for a country to complete on its own and is more efficient with international cooperation, he added. A rough comparison of the two cities' companies listed on the mainland A share market reflects the disparity in state dominance. About a third of roughly 40 Xi'an-based stocks were privately run, versus about two-thirds for well over 300 Shenzhen-based ones, according to data from Wind Information. When describing Xi'an's push for technological innovation, Mayor Li pointed to contributions from the city's non-state and foreign businesses. He noted how last year a local solar company named Longi Green Energy Technology became the largest publicly listed company in Western China, and claimed it is the world's largest manufacturer of monocrystalline silicon wafers. Li added that Micron has invested a total $1 billion in its Xi'an facility, which accounts for 90% of the company's global production capacity. Micron did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, looking more generally at China's national history, multiple state-led efforts to build up the local semiconductor industry have struggled to take off, McKinsey analysts wrote back in 2014. As an ancient capital of China, Xi'an also faces physical restrictions on urban expansion due to historical structures and artifacts, said Perry Wong, managing director of research at the Milken Institute. He expects the Chengdu-Chongqing urban area in southwestern China has a better chance at becoming a center for tech innovation. Shenzhen is "also enjoying (a) high degree of policy freedom that no other city in China has," Wong said, noting Xi'an would need to think creatively to mimic that kind of growth. "You cannot make a duplication of Shenzhen." One benefit Shenzhen has had is its proximity to Hong Kong , a semi-autonomous region just over the border that has enjoyed greater democratic freedoms and alignment with international business standards than the mainland. As Beijing strengthens its control of the region, an inevitable choice for Hong Kong companies will be to work more with the mainland. Hong Kong's businesses can share their experience and talent to contribute to China's development, said Tu Haiming, a Hong Kong member for a national political advisory body, called the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Tu spoke broadly of greater integration with the mainland in areas such as finance and academia. When it comes to tech, that talent doesn't need to look as far as Xi'an. Chinese semiconductor giant SMIC announced last month it was building a new $2.35 billion factory — in Shenzhen.
Xpeng beat its guidance for first quarter deliveries, while Nio topped a lowered forecast to come within its original projections. Shares of both companies rose more than 1% during Thursday's trading session in New York, but are still lower year-to-date. Still, the start-ups' record quarterly deliveries pale in comparison with BYD, which sold more new energy vehicles in March alone than Nio did in the entire first quarter, according to figures from Citi.	BEIJING — Two of China's U.S.-listed electric car start-ups beat market expectations in their March deliveries, with both companies setting quarterly records. Xpeng said Thursday it delivered 5,102 cars in March, beating implied deliveries of 4,262 cars for that month.  The company delivered a total of 13,340 vehicles in the first quarter, topping its guidance of 12,500 for the period. Nio announced deliveries of 7,257 vehicles in March, marking 20,060 cars for the first three months of the year — the most for any quarter, according to the company. That falls within Nio's original first quarter guidance of 20,000 to 20,500 vehicles. Nio had lowered the forecast last week to 19,500 cars after announcing a five-day factory closure due to a shortage in semiconductors. Shares of both companies rose more than 1% during Thursday's trading session in New York. The stocks remain in negative territory for the year so far, after surging in 2020. Xpeng's March deliveries were roughly split between the company's P7 sedan and G3 SUV. Among Nio's three models — all SUVs — the company said its five-seat ES6 saw the most demand with more than 3,000 deliveries last month. The delivery beat is "a very positive indicator of the China EV market growth trajectory for the rest of the year," Wedbush analysts Dan Ives and Strecker Backe wrote. They also predict March was a good month for Tesla in China, and expect electric vehicle stocks will climb 30% to 40% higher this year. However, the start-ups' record quarterly deliveries still pale in comparison with Chinese electric vehicle and battery manufacturer BYD . For the company's Han model alone — which comes in both hybrid and pure-electric versions — sales topped 10,000 units in March, BYD management told Citi analysts in a call Tuesday. BYD's total sales of new energy vehicles hit 23,000 units last month, according to Citi. BYD expects that in December, it can reach sales of 30,000 cars in just the battery-powered category, Citi said. Another U.S.-listed Chinese electric car start-up, Li Auto , had not released first quarter figures as of Friday morning Beijing time. The company forecast in February it would deliver between 10,500 and 11,500 cars in the first quarter, or fewer than 4,000 vehicles a month. Li Auto's only model on the market is an SUV that comes with a fuel tank for charging the battery. Li Auto shares rose 1% Thursday and are down about 12% year-to-date.
China may hurt its own long-term interests in Myanmar by taking a "laissez-faire" approach toward the coup, said Gareth Price, a senior research fellow at think tank Chatham House. Anti-coup demonstrators, outraged over Beijing's apparent lack of concern for those killed, attacked Chinese-run factories in Myanmar last month, the Associated Press reported. China is a major investor in Myanmar and the coup is becoming "a major test" for the countries' complex relationship, said Kaho Yu, senior Asia analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.	China's "laissez-faire" approach toward Myanmar's military coup could hurt the Asian giant's strategic and economic interests in the Southeast Asian country, said a political risk analyst. In contrast to strong condemnation and sanctions by Western powers — including the U.S. and the European Union — China's response to the Feb. 1 coup and the violence that followed has been more muted. Beijing has been cautious and is emphasizing the importance of stability. "But while China may be happy to deal with whoever wields power in Naypyidaw, it is increasingly clear the chain of events the coup unleashed could threaten its interests," Gareth Price, senior research fellow at the Asia-Pacific program of British think tank Chatham House, said in a March note. Naypyidaw is the capital city of Myanmar and one of the hotspots for anti-coup protests. Security forces have used increasingly violent tactics to suppress the demonstrations, killing more than 550 civilians, reported Reuters. Demonstrators, outraged over Beijing's apparent lack of concern for those killed in protests, attacked Chinese-run factories in Myanmar last month, the Associated Press reported. In response, Beijing urged Myanmar to "ensure the safety of life and property of Chinese businesses and personnel" there. "China's frustration with the risks facing its economic interests indicates that the coup has become a major test for the already complex Myanmar-China relationship," Kaho Yu, senior Asia analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said in a March report. China is a major investor in Myanmar, a frontier Southeast Asian country which shares one of its borders. Myanmar is also an important part of President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road Initiative. "In general, Beijing expects investment in Myanmar to contribute to its energy security, trade and stability in its neighbourhood," said Yu. "China maintains that an economic slowdown in its neighbourhood would result in social instability and security threats, which would in turn threaten the political stability of Chinese border provinces such as Yunnan," the analyst added. The latest available data by Myanmar's Directorate of Investment and Company Administration showed that approved foreign investments from China were around $139.4 million from October 2020 to January this year. Myanmar's financial year starts in October. The approved Chinese investments were exceeded only by Singapore's, which totaled around $378.3 million  in the same period, the data showed. In terms of trade, China is the top destination for Myanmar's exports and the largest source of imports into the Southeast Asian country. But Myanmar's importance to China extends beyond economics, said Price of Chatham House. "The oil and gas pipelines running through Myanmar diversify China's sources of supply and helps avoid using the Malacca Straits, a hotspot for piracy," he said. "And the development of ports and overland connectivity between China and Myanmar also help facilitate a greater Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean." Beijing has in the past cultivated cordial ties with both the Myanmar military, as well as the civilian government of de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, Yu pointed out. In recent years, international pressure on Myanmar due to the Rohingya crisis has pushed the country closer to China , he added. China's top diplomat State Councilor Wang Yi reportedly said last month that "no matter how the situation in Myanmar changes, China's determination to promote China-Myanmar relations will not waver." But any feeling on China's part that it will continue to be Myanmar's major partner regardless of who's in charge may be a "misjudgement," said Price. "If the military is forced to back down, it may result in a more pronounced anti-China tilt, threatening (China's) strategic interests," he said. Instead, Beijing could help end the coup — a move that might threaten its interests in Myanmar in the short term, but will likely advance them in the longer term, Price said. Myanmar's generals have no intention of ceding power but will struggle to hold on to it without China's support, he said. "As its global role expands, China should be learning to differentiate between various types of authoritarian government and judge its response accordingly," said Price. "China needs to be aware that a 'one size fits all' policy of non-interference will not win many friends, and any it does win are likely to be of the less salubrious kind."
The U.S. should be "extremely aggressive" to level the playing field with China in the ongoing competition between the two sides, Kevin O'Leary told CNBC. That could include delisting Chinese stocks and shutting Chinese companies out of the U.S. court system, the chairman of O'Shares ETFs said, admitting he is "a bit of a hawk" on this issue.	Acknowledging that he's a "bit of a hawk" toward China, Kevin O'Leary on Monday called for "extremely aggressive" steps to level the economic playing field between the United States and China. The chairman of O'Shares ETFs told CNBC's Hadley Gamble that the United States should make Chinese companies face barriers in the U.S. market that he said are similar to those U.S. companies deal with in China. That could include delisting Chinese stocks and shutting Chinese companies out of the U.S. court system, O'Leary said, adding that he is a manufacturer in China but faces barriers selling into the Chinese market. "I can't sell my product there, and yet they enjoy those benefits in North America and in Europe," the celebrity investor told CNBC's "Capital Connection" on Monday. Competition around trade and technology has sharpened between the United States and China in recent years. President Joe Biden has said Washington and its allies need to hold China accountable for its "abuses and coercion that undercut the foundations of the international economic system." But O'Leary speculated that European countries will not take a strong stance against China because they're reliant on China. "This idea (that) we're going to form a coalition — not gonna happen," he said. O'Leary said President Donald Trump had the "right policy," because China understands threats. "Maybe … really, at the height of this, delist their stocks off exchanges in America, stop them from getting access to the courts because we don't have access to theirs," he said. A number of Chinese companies have already been removed from the New York Stock Exchange this year. European countries "can't afford the hit" of losing China's business, but the U.S. has latitude because its economy is still the world's largest, O'Leary said.
The 2022 Winter Olympic Games are set to be hosted by Beijing between Feb. 4 to 20. Relations between major Western powers and China have been tense over allegations of severe human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region – home to the Uyghur Muslims, who have been identified by the United Nations, U.S. and UK as a repressed ethnic group. For its part, China has repeatedly denied allegations of forced labor and other abuses in Xinjiang.	Countries and companies outside China face rising pressure to boycott the Winter Olympics in Beijing next year, but China will not sit back idly in response, says political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. "Western governments and firms face mounting pressure from human rights advocates and political critics of China to boycott the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics," according to Eurasia Group analysts. The Games are due to take place between February 4 to 20. "China will punish countries that boycott the Games with political sanctions and commercial retaliation, but with much greater severity in the athletic boycott scenario," they said in a report published Thursday. "Campaigners have focused on Beijing's targeted repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, which some Western governments have called 'genocide,'" the report said. "Calls to shun what activists label the 'Genocide Games' will grow as the opening ceremony approaches, increasing risks for governments, corporates, and investors — whether they decide to boycott or not." Last month, the governments of Canada, the United Kingdom and United States issued a joint statement accusing the Chinese government of inflicting an "extensive program of repression" on the Uyghur people including detention camps, forced labor and forced sterilizations. China has repeatedly denied allegations of forced labor and other abuses in Xinjiang. The foreign ministry last month called such claims "malicious lies" designed to "smear China" and "frustrate China's development." Businesses have also been caught in the crossfire. In late March, H&M faced backlash in China over a statement — reportedly from last year — in which the Swedish retailer said it was "deeply concerned" by reports of forced labor in Xinjiang. Supporters of the Olympic boycott argue that it is "necessary to punish China for its systemic discrimination against ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang, crackdown on political freedoms in Hong Kong, and hostility to self-rule in Taiwan," the Eurasia report said. Eurasia outlined three possible scenarios: a diplomatic boycott, an athletic boycott, or a so-called "outlier scenario." The most likely scenario — with a 60% probability — is for the U.S. to join at least one other major Western country in a so-called diplomatic boycott of the Games. "A diplomatic boycott is defined here as downgrading or not sending government representatives to the Olympics and taking other high-profile steps to deny Beijing the limelight as host," the analysts explained. Eurasia said the likely participants in a diplomatic boycott would be the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, with the possibility of some European countries joining in. In Asia, however, U.S. partners such as Japan, India and South Korea — which have "more complex political dynamics" or deeper economic relations with China — are not expected to join such a boycott. The diplomatic approach is the least drastic scenario, according to Eurasia. In this scenario, which has a 30% probability, one or more Western countries could stop their athletes from participating in the Games, perhaps by applying domestic political pressure. An economic boycott is defined as the banning of U.S. spectators, broadcasters, and sponsors. "Athletic and economic boycotts, which are harder for audiences to ignore, would compel even harsher retaliation from Beijing, possibly involving a diplomatic freeze and more widespread consumer boycotts against Western brands," Eurasia analysts said. This is an outlier scenario where tensions between the West and China ease, and there will be "mild political statements about the Games" but no formal boycott, the analysts said, labeling it as "boycott lite." It's the least likely scenario and only has a 10% chance of happening, they said, adding: "There is currently not much cause for optimism about the trajectory of Sino-Western relations." Here, heads of states might decline to attend the Games and cite scheduling conflicts or other non-political excuses. "Rhetoric would fall far short of an enthusiastic endorsement of Beijing as host, but there would be no declaration of a boycott and no presentation of a united Western position," the report said. A boycott of the Olympics would "diminish any soft power dividend" that Chinese President Xi Jinping had hoped to gain from the event, which gives Beijing "a platform to promote its global status among domestic audiences and project a positive image to billions of foreign viewers around the world," the Eurasia analysts said. "Beijing will almost certainly retaliate against countries involved in boycotts," the analysts said. "Beijing's direct response to a diplomatic boycott would likely be a reciprocal boycott of Western events and sanctions against prominent boycott advocates." Increasingly, consumer businesses based outside China are attempting a balancing act — projecting an image of concern about human rights to consumers outside China on the one hand, while trying to avoid getting shut out of China's massive market on the other. "If a company does not boycott the Games, it risks reputational damage with Western consumers. But if it does, it risks being shut out of the Chinese market," the analysts said. Due to the high international profile of the Games, retaliation in China could be "even worse" than the present removal of H&M's commercial presence on the Chinese internet, they said. Still, the analysts say that most businesses will likely choose to participate in the Olympics as "the potential cost of losing access to the Chinese market will probably outweigh concerns over a Western consumer backlash," which Eurasia predicts will likely be brief. — CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.
BYD, which is backed by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett, disclosed Tuesday that sales of battery-powered passenger cars totaled 16,301 units last month. That's more than double Nio's deliveries in March of 7,257 cars. Rival start-up Xpeng delivered even fewer vehicles, at 5,102 units last month.	BEIJING — Chinese automaker BYD sold more than twice as many battery-powered electric cars as start-up Nio delivered in March. BYD, which is backed by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett , disclosed Tuesday that sales of its battery-powered passenger cars totaled 16,301 units last month. That's more than double Nio's deliveries in March of 7,257 cars. Rival start-up Xpeng delivered even fewer vehicles, at 5,102 units last month. Both companies still beat analysts' expectations with those figures. In the new energy vehicle category, which includes hybrid as well as pure-electric cars, BYD sold more than 23,000 units in March — that brings the total in the first quarter to 53,380 cars. BYD also sold nearly as many oil-fueled vehicles in the first quarter, at 49,394 units. The sales of electric cars come as China's auto market recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, which hit the country the hardest in the first quarter of 2020. New motor vehicle registrations in the first quarter of this year climbed to a record high of 9.66 million, China's Ministry of Public Security said Tuesday. New energy vehicles accounted for 466,000, or just over 6% of newly registered cars, the data showed. The percentage of new energy cars nationwide that are pure electric was 81.5% in the first quarter, about the same as the ratio in 2020, according to public security data. When it comes to the global market, China's electric automakers still have a large gap to close. Electric car market leader Tesla said last week it delivered 184,800 cars worldwide in the first quarter. While the U.S. electric car maker did not break out figures for China, the company noted in a release: "We are encouraged by the strong reception of the Model Y in China and are quickly progressing to full production capacity." Elon Musk 's car company began deliveries of a China-made Model Y in January. The car was the third best-selling new energy vehicle in China in February, according to the China Passenger Car Association . Tesla has installed annual production capacity for 200,000 Model Y units at its factory in Shanghai, according to an investor presentation in late January.
Hong Kong people have become "distressed" and "disillusioned" as the city becomes less free and safe, said Emily Lau, a former Democratic Party member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council. Lau said people fear that "we probably have lost our freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, freedom of demonstration maybe not forever, but for many, many years." Beijing last year bypassed Hong Kong's legislature to implement a national security law and last month approved sweeping changes to Hong Kong's electoral system.	A former pro-democracy lawmaker in Hong Kong says people there have become "distressed" and "disillusioned" as some fear the city has lost important freedoms. Widespread pro-democracy protests that rocked Hong Kong in 2019 have largely subsided, in part due to the outbreak of  Covid-19 and the enactment of a controversial national security law last year. Emily Lau, a former Democratic Party member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, said some Hong Kongers now fear that "we probably have lost our freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, freedom of demonstration maybe not forever, but for many, many years." "And that's how distressed and how disillusioned the Hong Kong people are," Lau told CNBC's Martin Soong on Tuesday. Beijing bypassed Hong Kong's legislature to implement a national security law last year. Last month, China approved sweeping changes to Hong Kong's electoral system that critics said would hold back pro-democracy politicians . Those moves followed months of pro-democracy protests in 2019 that sometimes turned violent. Chinese and Hong Kong authorities have said the changes would safeguard national security and quell anti-China movement in the semi-autonomous region. Hong Kong is a former British colony that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed prior to Hong Kong's return stated that the city would have "a high degree of autonomy," including legislative and independent judicial power. "Rights and freedoms, including those of the person, of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of academic research and of religious belief will be ensured by law in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region," the declaration said. But critics of China — who include pro-democracy activists and governments such as those in the U.S. and the U.K. — have accused China of undermining Hong Kong's autonomy. Dozens of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong have been arrested and charged under the national security law. But Lau said: "I refuse to allow myself to be intimidated into silence." "We want China to keep the promises of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law," she said, adding that she and other activists are not seeking to overthrow the Hong Kong government or the central government in Beijing. The Basic Law is Hong Kong's mini constitution that enshrines the principle of "one country, two systems" used to govern the city. Beijing, on its part, has said that the national security law and electoral changes in Hong Kong are in line with the "one country, two systems" framework .
Venture capitalist, early Facebook investor, and conservative donor Peter Thiel criticized big U.S. technology companies for being too close to China. Thiel criticized Google for its work on artificial intelligence, mainly around the company's artificial intelligence work with Chinese universities. Thiel also said that Apple was unlikely to confront China because of its massive supply chain to manufacture iPhones and other products in the country.	Tech investor Peter Thiel criticized big U.S. technology companies for being too close to China at a Tuesday appearance at a virtual event held by the Richard Nixon Foundation. Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and sits on Facebook 's board after making an early investment, is an outspoken voice in the technology investment world is known for contrarian opinions and conservative leanings. He's backed defense contractors like Palantir and publicly supported former President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign for president. On Wednesday, the Nixon session focused on China, and he was joined by former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien. Thiel criticized Google for its work on artificial intelligence with Chinese universities, partially because of conversations he claimed to have with company insiders, according to a transcript of the event reviewed by CNBC. "Since everything in China is a civilian- military fusion, Google was effectively working with the Chinese military, not with the American military," Thiel said. He also sad that Google "insiders" told him that they worked with the Chinese because "they figured they might as well give the technology out the front door, because if they didn't give it – it would get stolen anyway." A Google spokesperson told CNBC: "These allegations are baseless. We do not work with the Chinese military. We are proud to continue our long history of work with the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense, in many areas including cybersecurity, recruiting and healthcare." Thiel had previously criticized Google in 2019 , saying that the FBI and CIA should investigate Google and ask whether it had been compromised by Chinese spies. Thiel also said that Apple was unlikely to confront China because of its massive supply chain to manufacture iPhones and other products in the country. He noted that other big technology companies like Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft don't have as extensive business interests in the country, in some cases because the Chinese government has restricted what they can do there. He called for the U.S. to put a "lot of pressure" and scrutiny on Apple because of its labor supply chain in the country. " Apple is probably the one that's structurally a real problem, because the whole iPhone supply chain gets made from China," Thiel said. "Apple is one that has real synergies with China." He also appeared to change his position on Bitcoin during the talk. Thiel has invested in Bitcoin companies and previously said he was "long bitcoin" and considers it the "digital equivalent of gold." On Tuesday, Thiel said that Bitcoin threatens the U.S. dollar. "Even though I'm sort of a pro-crypto, pro-Bitcoin maximalist person, I do wonder whether at this point Bitcoin should also be thought in part of as a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S., where it threatens fiat money, but it especially threatens the U.S. dollar, and China wants to do things to weaken it, so China's long Bitcoin," Thiel said.
Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University, said he found it "really curious" that U.S. President Joe Biden has left much of his predecessor's policies on China in place. Roach noted that Biden kept the "seriously flawed" phase one trade deal and the tariffs on China even though he reversed many other policies enacted by former President Donald Trump. Roach, who's a former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, said he's "very concerned" about escalating U.S.-China rhetoric.	Leading economist Stephen Roach said he found it "really curious" that U.S. President Joe Biden has left much of his predecessor's policies on China in place. Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University, said Biden kept the "seriously flawed" U.S.-China phase one trade deal and the tariffs on China — but reversed many other policies enacted by former President Donald Trump . "Why has he singled out the China-Trump policy as one that is worth sustaining, when he has literally tried to wipe the slate clean of every other potential Trump policy that he inherited? That's an important question that needs to be answered," Roach told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Thursday. During Trump's term, the U.S. and China were engaged in a trade war that threatened to derail the global economy after both sides slapped retaliatory tariffs on each other's products. The phase one trade deal put a pause to the trade fight, but did not roll back those elevated tariffs. Economists and businesses have argued that Trump's tariffs on China harm the U.S. economy , and fail to force China to reverse its unfair trade practices. Meanwhile, some observers said the tariffs could give the U.S. leverage over China . Biden has said he disagreed with Trump's approach to China, but is not in a hurry to reverse his predecessor's policies . His administration has also suggested that it's open to using tariffs to fight China's unfair trade practices. U.S.-China relations got off to a rocky start under the Biden administration. Last month, the two countries' first high-level meeting kicked off with an exchange of insults, and the U.S. — along with some of its Western allies — slapped sanctions on Chinese officials and entities for human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region. Beijing retaliated against the U.S. and its allies with its own sanctions. Roach, who's a former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, said he's "very concerned" about escalating U.S.-China rhetoric. "The situation is going from bad to worse and it doesn't have to do that," he said. "We need, I think, a more level-headed approach from the U.S. side as well as from the Chinese side to go back to the areas that we have in common."
The Commerce Department added seven Chinese supercomputing entities to a U.S. economic blacklist citing national security concerns. The seven entities were blacklisted for "building supercomputers used by China's military actors, its destabilizing military modernization efforts, and/or weapons of mass destruction programs." U.S. officials have long complained that Chinese companies are beholden to the People's Republic of China and collect sensitive information on behalf of the People's Liberation Army.	WASHINGTON – The Commerce Department on Thursday added seven Chinese supercomputing entities to a U.S. economic blacklist citing national security concerns. The department added Tianjin Phytium Information Technology, Shanghai High-Performance Integrated Circuit Design Center, Sunway Microelectronics, the National Supercomputing Center Jinan, the National Supercomputing Center Shenzhen, the National Supercomputing Center Wuxi and the National Supercomputing Center Zhengzhou to its blacklist. The seven entities were blacklisted for "building supercomputers used by China's military actors, its destabilizing military modernization efforts, and/or weapons of mass destruction programs." U.S. officials have long complained that Chinese companies are beholden to the People's Republic of China and collect sensitive information on behalf of the People's Liberation Army. The Chinese Communist Party has previously said that it does not engage in industrial espionage. "Supercomputing capabilities are vital for the development of many – perhaps almost all – modern weapons and national security systems, such as nuclear weapons and hypersonic weapons," U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo wrote in a statement. "The Department of Commerce will use the full extent of its authorities to prevent China from leveraging U.S. technologies to support these destabilizing military modernization efforts," she added. The new rules, which restrict U.S. exports to the entities in question, take effect immediately. However, they do not apply to goods from U.S. suppliers that are already en route. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Under former President Donald Trump , the U.S. added a slew of Chinese companies to its economic blacklist, including the country's top smartphone maker, Huawei, top chipmaker SMIC and the largest drone manufacturer, SZ DJI Technology.
Young people today aren't willing to work on factory floors, said Shirley Zhou, IT director at Midea, a home appliance giant based in southern China. To prepare for a future in which an aging population will further limit the labor supply, Midea has embarked on a three-year plan to incorporate more technology into its 34 factories. The challenge for factory efficiency in the future is a problem of education on digital knowledge, not age, said Junsong Peng, vice president and chief digital officer of software company SAP China.	BEIJING — Factories in China are turning to technology to tackle a pending labor shortage. Per official figures, the country's working age population has shrunk by more than 5 million people in the last decade as births have dropped – despite a rollback of the controversial one-child policy. And for the factories that have driven much of modern China's growth, workers are already in short supply , pushing wages up. That's forcing companies to relocate or increase automation, especially as the labor shortage looks like it will only get worse. Young people today aren't willing to work on factory floors, said Shirley Zhou, IT director at Midea , a home appliance giant based in southern China. The company raked in 77.69 billion yuan ($11.95 billion) in operating revenue for the quarter ended September, up more than 15% from a year ago. While Midea can find enough workers for now, the company has embarked on a three-year plan to incorporate more technology into its 34 factories, beginning with seven this year, Zhou said. The goal is to double that number next year, and cover 25 factories in 2023, she said. The company's modeling predicts that automating manufacturing with sensors and robots will increase assembly efficiency across its factories by 15% to 20%. For two factories that have already integrated such tech, efficiency has increased by nearly 30%, Zhou said. Midea's strategy marks just one of many technology upgrades that analysts say factories around the world are increasingly pursuing. Sometimes called "smart" or "intelligent" manufacturing, widespread use of new hardware and software in production is expected to ultimately boost efficiency as much as the Industrial Revolution did in the 18th and 19th centuries. From an economic perspective, technology is now key for growth as countries like China work to keep local production cheap enough for companies to stay. "Every company, or even if it's a third-party manufacturer that has manufacturing facilities in China ... they are under pressure to invest in smart manufacturing," said Rodrigo Cambiaghi, Greater China supply chain and operations leader at EY. He noted such investment reduces China's reliance on labor and increases the country's ability to produce more, and higher-quality, goods. "That is fundamental to keep volumes within China for those labor-intensive products," he said. "This is not something that will be solved in a very short period of time. But the momentum is there and China is focusing a lot of the funds, a lot of the engineering capability of the country, to really drive smart manufacturing capabilities." Attention on factory digitalization has increased since the coronavirus pandemic. In half a year, Chinese industrial internet company Deltaphone completed two rounds of financing to raise of nearly 300 million yuan, according to early investor Yunqi Partners. BMW's joint venture with Brilliance Auto said it uses nearly 4,000 robots across three factories, and plans initial installment of 2,000 robots for new factories opening next year. Overall, artificial intelligence company Megvii, which sells software for automating warehouse operations, expects 2020 was the first year of real application of artificial intelligence to logistics, and this year will see the beginning of significant integration. Part of the reason why the factory digitalization trend is set to pick up is that the cost of sensors for gathering data on how well machines are operating has dropped significantly over the last 10 years, said Leo Li, partner at consulting firm Oliver Wyman and head of automotive, manufacturing and industrial products for Greater China. As a result, a factory can detect production problems more quickly and resolve them — with fewer workers. "Today's factories are completely different from the past," Li said, according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks. "The number of so-called blue-collar (workers) has dropped dramatically — there are more 'knowledge' workers. Efficiency is rising more and more." One of the major areas of application is in automobile manufacturing. German software company SAP began its operations in China by working with Volkswagen's local joint venture in 1995, according to Junsong Peng, vice president and chief digital officer of SAP China. He said corporate analysis of such tech upgrades shows production efficiency and delivery time improves by about 20% to 30%. That's just a start for how much technology can contribute, Peng said. The challenge for factory efficiency in the future is a problem of education on digital tool management, not age, he said, according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks. "If an older employee can learn, a job in the auto industry today is no longer one that requires a lot of physical strength." The effects of factory digitalization also extends to global supply chains. Companies are particularly interested in using technology to track and analyze their worldwide production, to ensure that goods can be delivered to customers, said Jeremy Deutsch, Asia-Pacific president for data center operator Equinix . He said increased digitalization of factories is driving new demand for data centers, whose initial growth came from social media and financial services. China's rapid recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has kept factories in the country — and very busy — as other countries still struggle to control the disease. This boost to China's factories will likely only continue for another year, said Yipin Ng, founding partner of Shanghai-based Yunqi Partners. Businesses will still want to diversify some of their supply chain to other countries in the next five years, he said. Even if technology is a consideration, Ng said there's a long way to go as many factories he's visited in China are still not even connected to the internet, and businesses in other countries can develop similar tech tools. But in China, the pressure to address labor productivity will only increase. "My personal concern is not that we will have excess labor or employment (problems)," said Victor Du, Shanghai-based managing director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal Asia. "As a society, the concern should (be) achieving the same level of manufacturing output, or even higher quality, higher output, with a lower population after twenty, thirty years. If you look at this point, digitalization or upgrading of technology will be very necessary."
"We believe President Biden represents a greater risk for financial firms on the China front than President Trump," Cowen Washington Research Group's D.C.-based analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote in an April 7 note. "(Delisting) is going to happen. Congress enacted legislation last year, and we see no probable scenario in which it repeals this law," Seiberg said, noting it's unlikely Beijing will allow the U.S. to inspect audits. Since taking office in late January, U.S. President Joe Biden has kept a firm stance on China.	BEIJING — As U.S.-China tensions continue to simmer under a new administration, risks for American investors with exposure to China are only going to rise, according to a report from Cowen. "We believe President Biden represents a greater risk for financial firms on the China front than President Trump," Cowen Washington Research Group's D.C.-based analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote in an April 7 note. "We believe Team Biden will be more strategic, more multi-lateral and more effective in how it confronts China than Team Trump." The unrelenting U.S. pressure will likely turn Trump-era policies with initially long grace periods into a reality. That includes delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges, Seiberg said. Tensions between the two countries escalated under former President Donald Trump, initially centering on trade and then spilling over into technology and finance. The Trump administration wanted to curb U.S. investment in Chinese companies and stocks with new regulation, but the policies had relatively less impact than tariffs and sanctions on Chinese companies. Since taking office in late January, U.S. President Joe Biden has kept a firm stance on China. His administration called the country, a more assertive "competitor " and on Thursday added more Chinese technology companies to a U.S. blacklist, citing national security concerns. "(Delisting) is going to happen. Congress enacted legislation last year, and we see no probable scenario in which it repeals this law," Seiberg said, noting it's unlikely Beijing will allow the U.S. to inspect audits. "This will likely force these Chinese firms to trade in Hong Kong." In December, Trump signed a law stating that foreign companies cannot be listed on a U.S. exchange if they do not comply for three straight years with audits from the U.S. Public Accounting Oversight Board. The board's website lists roughly 300 instances of denied inspections , with the overwhelming majority from U.S.-listed Chinese companies such as Alibaba and Baidu . In the last 15 years, some Chinese companies were able to raise billions of U.S. dollars through stock listings before their financial fraud was revealed , causing huge investor losses. Despite the growing political tensions, 30 China-based companies went public in the U.S. last year — raising the most capital since Alibaba's giant IPO in 2014 — and many more have held initial public offerings since. Optimists have said the three-year compliance period would give companies and politicians time to act. Cowen's Seiberg expects the Biden administration will block U.S. investment in Chinese banks and expand a U.S. investment blacklist to include more Chinese companies, especially ones with alleged ties to the Chinese military. Chinese companies will likely face more challenges in acquiring U.S. financial firms, including fintech start-ups, given a continuation of limits on Chinese acquisition of U.S. consumer data, Seiberg said. Some extreme, but very unlikely, measures the Biden administration could take include prohibiting Hong Kong from clearing U.S. dollars, he said. But he doesn't expect the U.S. will go so far as to cancel China's holdings of U.S. Treasurys. "It would destroy global demand for U.S. Treasury securities as foreigners would fear they could become the next target," Seiberg said. China is the world's second-largest holder of Treasurys. The Biden administration would also need to watch out for Beijing's retaliation. China could stop complying with prior commitments and revoke changes that allow foreign firms to gain majority ownership of their operations in China, including in finance, Seiberg said. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.
Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung Electronics control more than 70% of the semiconductor manufacturing market. A global semiconductor shortage and tensions with China have bolstered U.S. scrutiny of the supply chain and created a drive to regain leadership. Under President Joe Biden, the U.S. is looking to bring manufacturing back to American soil and reduce reliance on a handful of chipmakers.	GUANGZHOU, China — If you talk about chipmaking, two companies usually spring to mind — Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung Electronics. The two Asian firms combined control more than 70% of the semiconductor manufacturing market. The U.S., which was once a leader, lags behind in this space after monumental shifts in the business models in the semiconductor industry. But a global semiconductor shortage and geopolitical tensions with China have bolstered Washington's scrutiny of the supply chain, which is concentrated in the hands of a small number of players, and has created a drive to bring manufacturing back to American soil to regain leadership. The U.S. has earmarked billions of dollars and is reportedly looking at alliances with other nations. Semiconductors are critical to everything from cars to the smartphones we use. And they have also been thrust into the center of U.S.-China tensions. "One characteristic of US policy is that it has heavy emphasis on China. This has now become a national imperative to enhance self-sufficiency in semis production, accelerated by the recent chip shortages and the 'tech war' against China," Bank of America said in a note published Wednesday. The key to understanding the geopolitics of semiconductors, which countries dominate and why the U.S. is trying to boost its domestic industry, lies in coming to grips with the supply chain and business models. Companies like Intel are integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), which design and manufacture their own chips. Then there are the fabless semiconductor firms, which design chips but outsource manufacturing to so-called foundries. The two biggest foundries are TSMC in Taiwan and Samsung Electronics in South Korea. Over the last 15 years or so, companies began shifting to this fabless model. TSMC and Samsung took advantage as they began to invest heavily in leading-edge manufacturing technology. Now if a company like Apple wants to get the latest chip for their iPhone produced, they have to turn to TSMC to do it. TSMC has 55% foundry market share and Samsung has 18%, according to data from Trendforce. Taiwan and South Korea collectively have 81% of the global market in foundries, highlighting the dominance and reliance on these two countries as well as on TSMC and Samsung. "In 2001, 30 companies manufactured at the leading edge however as semi manufacturing grew in cost and difficulty, this number has fallen to just 3 firms" — TSMC, Intel and Samsung, according to a note from Bank of America published in December. However, Intel's manufacturing process is still behind that of TSMC and Samsung. "Taiwan and South Korea have become leaders in wafer fabrication which requires massive capital investment; and part of their success over the last 20 years is due to supportive government policies and access to skilled labour forces," Neil Campling, head of technology, media and telecoms research at Mirabaud Securities, told CNBC by email. While TSMC and Samsung are the dominant manufacturers of semiconductors, they still rely heavily on equipment and machinery from the U.S., Europe and Japan. The companies that make these tools required by foundries are known as semiconductor capital equipment vendors or "semicap" for short. The top five semicap equipment vendors make up nearly 70% of the market, according to Bank of America, citing Gartner data. Three of the five are U.S. companies, one is European and one is Japanese. Netherlands-based ASML is the only company in the world that can make so-called extreme ultraviolet (EUV), which is required to make the most advanced chips such as those manufactured by TSMC and Samsung. So, the U.S. is not necessarily falling behind in the semiconductor industry as a whole. Some of its firms are integral to the supply chain. But one area it has lagged in is manufacturing. Under President Joe Biden, the U.S. is looking to regain leadership in manufacturing and secure supply chains. In February, Biden signed an executive order which involves a review of the semiconductor supply chain to identify risks. As part of a $2 trillion economic stimulus package, $50 billion was earmarked for semiconductor manufacturing and research . A bill known as the CHIPS for America Act is also working its way through the legislative process and aims to provide incentives to enable advanced research and development and secure the supply chain. Meanwhile, U.S. firm Intel last month announced plans to spend $20 billion to build two new chip factories and said it will act as a foundry . This could offer a domestic alternative to the likes of TSMC and Samsung. Part of that scrutiny on the supply chain has been prompted by a global chip shortage that's hit the automotive industry . The coronavirus pandemic accelerated demand for personal electronics like laptops and games consoles just as industrials and automakers wound down production. But a rebound in production plus heightened demand for chips in various sectors has triggered a shortage. The concentration of production in the hands of TSMC and Samsung has worsened the problem. The semiconductor supply shortage "has probably made the U.S. administration realise they aren't in control of their own destiny," according to Mirabaud Securities' Campling. But there are also geopolitical factors at play, informing U.S. policy. "Over the longer-term, the Biden administration wants to continue to encourage both foreign and U.S. semiconductor manufacturers to expand capacity in the U.S., to reduce dependence on manufacturing in geopolitically sensitive areas such as Taiwan, and create high paying engineering jobs in the U.S.," Paul Triolo, head of the geo-technology practice at Eurasia Group, told CNBC by email. Part of the U.S. policy in the semiconductor space involves forming alliances. Earlier this month, the Nikkei reported that the U.S. and Japan will cooperate on supply chains for critical components like semiconductors. The two sides will aim for a system where production is not concentrated on specific regions like Taiwan, the Nikkei said. "The U.S. is trying to cut China out of the equation," Abishur Prakash, a geopolitical specialist at the Center for Innovating the Future, a Toronto-based consulting firm, told CNBC via email. "It is trying to redesign how the world's chip industry works in the face of a rising China. This is not necessarily about self-sufficiency, although Washington would welcome this. Instead, it is about building up critical sectors — from AI to chips — that are insulated from geopolitics. And, because several nations share U.S. concerns about China, the U.S. is taking a chunk of the world with it." China meanwhile is trying to push self-sufficiency amid U.S. moves to cut it off from key supplies. Over the past few years, China has tried to boost its semiconductor industry through huge investments and incentives like tax breaks. But China remains well behind everywhere else and that goes back to the supply chain. SMIC is China's largest foundry, a competitor to the likes of TSMC and Samsung. But SMIC's technology is several years behind that of its Taiwan and South Korean rivals. And even if it wanted to advance, it's extremely difficult due to U.S. sanctions and actions. Washington put SMIC on a blacklist known as the Entity List last year . That restricts American companies from exporting certain technology to SMIC, holding back the chipmaker due to the key role U.S. firms play in the semiconductor supply chain. Roughly 80% or more of SMIC equipment comes from U.S. vendors, according to Bank of America. Last year, Reuters reported that the U.S. pressured the Netherlands government to stop the sale of an ASML machine to SMIC. The Dutch firm is the only company that makes the so-called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machine that is needed to make the most cutting-edge chips. That machine has still not been shipped to China. "If China wants to manufacture leading edge chips, it is virtually impossible without equipment from the US or allies," Bank of America said in its December note. "We remain skeptical about a meaningful progress in China's progress due to US restrictions as it is materially behind in IP (intellectual property) and has limited access to IP given the US restrictions," Bank of America said in a separate note last week. "Our team expects a delay of around 5+ years before it makes a more significant progress."
Alibaba was fined 18.23 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) by Chinese regulators as a result of an anti-monopoly investigation. Alibaba shares rose 6% in premarket trading in the U.S. following a 6.5% rally in Hong Kong. Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said he does not expect a material impact on the company from the change of this exclusivity arrangement.	GUANGZHOU, China — Alibaba shares rose 6% in premarket trading in the U.S. after the company was fined 18.23 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) by Chinese regulators as a result of an anti-monopoly investigation. Alibaba 's Hong Kong-listed shares closed 6.5% higher on Monday. "Despite the record fine amount, we think this should lift a major overhang on BABA and shift the market's focus back to fundamentals," Morgan Stanley wrote in a note on Sunday, a day after the fine was issued. Chinese regulators opened an anti-monopoly probe into Alibaba in December. The main focus was around a practice that forces merchants to list their products on one of two e-commerce platforms, rather than choosing both. China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said on a Saturday that this practice stifles competition in China's online retail market and "infringes on the businesses of merchants on the platforms and the legitimate rights and interests of consumers." Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said he does not expect a material impact on the company from the change of this exclusivity arrangement. Zhang also said Alibaba will introduce new measures to lower the entry barriers and costs for businesses and merchants on the platform. The company will also continue to expand to smaller Chinese cities and rural areas, the CEO added. China's technology companies have grown, largely unencumbered, into giants. But Beijing is becoming increasingly concerned by the power of these firms . Regulatory scrutiny has focused on Alibaba founder Jack Ma's empire after the billionaire made some comments in October that appeared critical of China's financial regulator . Not long after, regulators pulled the plug on what would have been a record-setting initial public offering of Ant Group, the financial technology giant Ma founded. Joe Tsai, the executive vice chairman of Alibaba, said on Monday he is not aware of any more investigations regarding the anti-monopoly law. "We are pleased that we are able to put this matter behind us," Tsai said. But Tsai said that Alibaba and its peers are subject to inquiries from regulators on mergers, acquisitions and strategic investments as part of a review process. In addition to the fine, which amounts to about 4% of the company's 2019 revenue, regulators said Alibaba will have to file self-examination and compliance reports to the SAMR for three years. — CNBC's Christine Wang contributed to this report.
The global chip shortage is a highly-complex issue involving multiple components. But despite a slew of factors behind the issue, Huawei's rotating chairman Eric Xu tried to lay the blame on the U.S. on Monday. Huawei also announced that it is planning to invest $1 billion into self-driving and electric car research and development as it looks to compete with the likes of Tesla, Apple, Nio and Xiaomi.	The global chip shortage is a highly-complex and multifaceted issue, but Chinese tech company Huawei attempted to blame the U.S. for it on Monday. Eric Xu, Huawei's rotating chairman, said the sanctions imposed on the firm over the last two years are, "hurting the global semiconductor industry" because they have "disrupted the trusted relationship in the semiconductor industry." Demand for chips has soared during the coronavirus pandemic as people snapped up games consoles, laptops and TVs to help get through lockdowns. Insatiable demand for electronics isn't the only reason why semiconductors are in short supply; shifting business models in the industry has also created a bottleneck at outsourced chip factories. The relatively small number of chip manufacturing plants and the lack of competition is another huge issue. But despite all these factors, Huawei tried to lay the bulk of the blame on U.S. sanctions on Monday. Speaking to analysts in Shenzhen at Huawei's Analyst Summit, Xu said: "The U.S. sanctions is the main reason why we are seeing panic stockpiling of major companies around the world." He added: "Some of them never stockpiled anything, but because of the sanctions they are now having three months or six months of stockpiles." Huawei itself has built up a stockpile of chips to try to ensure its business — focused on telecoms equipment and consumer electronics — can continue as normal. Some companies in other industries, such as the automotive sector, have been forced to temporarily shut down operations as a result of the chip shortage. U.S. auto executives and tech leaders were scheduled to meet remotely with President Joe Biden on Monday. The U.S. imposed sanctions on Huawei after accusing it of building backdoors into its equipment that could be exploited by the Chinese Communist Party for espionage purposes. In 2019, Huawei was put on a U.S. blacklist called the Entity List . This restricted American companies from exporting certain technologies to Huawei. Google ended up cutting ties with Huawei , meaning the Chinese giant could not use Google's Android operating system on its smartphones. Last year, the U.S. moved to cut Huawei off from key chip supplies it needs for its smartphones. Huawei strongly denies the U.S. allegations. Huawei is pursuing new avenues after the sanctions imposed by the Trump administration left its once-leading smartphone business in tatters, while also hindering progress in its semiconductor and 5G businesses. Xu said he doesn't expect the Biden administration to change the rules any time soon and the company is investing in new areas like health care, farming, and electric cars to try to mitigate the impact of being blacklisted by the U.S. "We believe, we'll continue to live and work under the entity listing for a long period of time," he said. "The overall strategy as well as the specific initiatives for Huawei are all designed and developed in a way that the company would be able to survive and develop while staying on the entity list for a long time." Huawei said Monday it plans to invest $1 billion into self-driving and electric car research and development as it looks to compete with the likes of Tesla , Apple , Nio and Xiaomi . Xu claimed that Huawei's self-driving technology already surpasses Tesla's as it allows cars to cruise for more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) without human intervention. Tesla's vehicles can't do more than 800 kilometers and drivers are meant to keep their hands on the wheel for safety purposes. Huawei will initially partner with three automakers on self-driving cars including BAIC Group, Chongqing Changan Automobile Co and Guangzhou Automobile Group. A new "HI" (Huawei Inside) logo will be put on cars in the same way that Intel's logo is put on some computers. "Once self-driving is achieved, we're able to disrupt all of the related industries, and we think that in the foreseeable future, namely in the next decade, the biggest opportunity and breakthrough will be from the automobile industry," Xu said. Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Huawei's Eric Xu is one of three rotating chairmen.
Alibaba affiliate Ant Group was ordered to revamp its business by Chinese regulators. That, along with a 18.23 billion yuan ($2.78 billion) fine Alibaba received as a result of an anti-monopoly investigation by regulators, removed a source of uncertainty for investors. Alibaba's Hong Kong shares rose in Tuesday trade, after its U.S.-listed shares rallied more than 9% overnight.	GUANGZHOU, China — Alibaba shares in Hong Kong closed 0.43% higher on Tuesday after regulators ordered the e-commerce giant's financial technology affiliate Ant Group to revamp its business. That, along with a 18.23 billion yuan ($2.78 billion) fine Alibaba received as a result of an anti-monopoly investigation by regulators, removed a source of uncertainty for investors. "Following the decision and penalties levied by SAMR's (State Administration for Market Regulation) anti-monopoly investigation of BABA, we think the street has more color about the latest updates on Ant Group," Jefferies said in a note published Monday. Hong Kong-listed shares of Alibaba jumped about 4% at the open but pared those gains throughout the day. Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares closed over 9% higher on Monday but were about 1.6% lower in pre-market trade. Alibaba, owns a roughly 33% stake in Ant Group, the company that runs the massively popular mobile payments app Alipay in China. In November, regulators forced Ant Group to suspend what would have been a record-setting $34.5 billion initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong and Shanghai . At the time, changes in the financial technology regulatory environment were blamed for the suspension of the listing. That came just days after Jack Ma, the founder of Ant Group and Alibaba, made some comments that appeared critical of China's financial regulator . In December, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) ordered Ant Group to rectify its business . And on Monday, the Chinese central bank outlined concrete details on what the company needs to do . The PBOC asked Ant Group to restructure into a financial holding company. Ant Group must also create more separation between its payment app Alipay and its credit products. Yu'e Bao, Ant Group's money market fund, which was once the world's largest, must also be reduced in size, the PBOC said. Both Alibaba's massive anti-trust fine and the Ant Group restructuring plan are part of a broader push by China to get a tighter grip on the country's technology companies, which turned into giants largely unencumbered. Their activities often span across sectors from gaming to financial technology as well as cloud computing. While so far Beijing's eyes have been focused on Jack Ma's empire , there are signs that the crackdown could broaden to more companies and other areas such as data protection .
The country's customs agency said Tuesday that in dollar terms, exports rose 30.6% in March from a year ago, missing expectations for growth of 35.5%. Looking ahead to the next three months, customs spokesperson Li Kuiwen told reporters that last year's high base poses challenges for trade in the second quarter. China's early emergence from the pandemic and stimulus overseas have driven purchases of products made by Chinese factories, two factors that will fade away later this year, said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie.	BEIJING — China's economy was buoyed by strong exports last year, but that boost is waning. The country's customs agency said Tuesday that in dollar terms, exports rose 30.6% in March from a year ago, missing expectations for growth of 35.5%. Looking ahead to the next three months, customs spokesperson Li Kuiwen told reporters that last year's high base poses challenges for trade in the second quarter. In addition, Li said the resurgence of Covid-19 cases and overseas uncertainties — such as the Suez Canal blockage — mean China still has a long way to go in achieving stable growth in trade. Chinese authorities would like to shift the economy's reliance to private consumption for growth, and away from manufacturing of goods for export. But the category still plays a significant role in the overall economy. Last year, Chinese factories were able to resume production far earlier that those in other countries still struggling with the pandemic. National exports rose 3.6% last year, while the country's GDP grew 2.3% as the only major economy to expand amid the pandemic. Much of the exports growth last year came from a surge in demand for face masks and other protective gear. China's early emergence from the pandemic and stimulus overseas have driven purchases of products made by Chinese factories, noted Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie. "These two factors (will) both fade away in the rest of this year as other countries reopen and consumers are able to spend more on services," he said in an email Tuesday. "Therefore, I don't think the current pace could sustain." March's 30.6% increase in exports comes off a low base. China's exports fell by 13.6% in the first quarter of last year amid a GDP contraction of 6.8%, according to data accessed through Wind Information. Nomura analysts expect export growth to decline to 10% to 15% in April, with a more significant slowdown in the second half of the year. In another sign of limits to trade's ability to contribute to national growth, cross-border e-commerce between China and other countries showed muted performance in the first quarter. The new, internet-driven trend contributed 419.5 billion yuan ($64.5 billion) to trade in the first three months of the year. That marked just under 5% of China's trade during that time — little changed from the ratio of nearly 5.3% for all of last year. While the first quarter figures marked 46.5% growth from a subdued base a year ago, the value of cross-border e-commerce trade in the first three months of the year was below last year's quarterly average of 422.5 billion yuan. "The proportion of cross-border e-commerce remains low, (showing) the limits it has on contributing to imports and exports and the economy as a whole," said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance. That's according to a CNBC translation of his Chinese-language statement. He expects Chinese authorities will focus on expanding domestic demand and the local market, as a way to hedge against potential fluctuations in foreign trade. Imports rose a greater-than-expected 38.1% in March. China is set to release first-quarter GDP figures on Friday. Data for January and February are typically distorted by the Spring Festival, the country's biggest holiday of the year.
"A lot of investors think the short term play is the U.S., where the stimulus is ramping up, versus China, where there are signals a more prudent take will be taken, especially in the second half of the year," said Cameron Brandt, director of research at EPFR Global. Chinese stock funds saw net positive cumulative flows for much of last year that exceeded U.S. levels — until December, EPFR data showed. Net cumulative investment in U.S. stock funds since the beginning of 2020 reached $170 billion in the week ended April 7, versus $29.78 billion for Chinese stock funds, according to EPFR.	BEIJING — Investors are putting billions of dollars more into U.S. stock funds than Chinese ones, according to data from fund research firm EPFR Global. "The baton seems to be getting handed over," said Cameron Brandt, director of research at EPFR, in an interview Friday. "A lot of investors think the short term play is the U.S., where the stimulus is ramping up, versus China, where there are signals a more prudent take will be taken, especially in the second half of the year." U.S. stocks plunged in March 2020 as worries about the coronavirus pandemic's impact on economic growth gripped the markets. By that time, China was on its way to controlling the domestic spread of the virus and the economy returned to growth in the second quarter. Now, roughly a year out, global investors are reassessing their outlook on both countries. Since U.S. President Joe Biden took office in late January, the White House has launched additional stimulus of $1.9 trillion and announced a $2 trillion infrastructure spending plan. The Biden administration has also maintained a tough stance on China, which creates a political overhang for U.S. investment in Chinese assets. But in a global context, U.S. and China stock funds are the two regions that have attracted the most inflows from international investors over the past two quarters, Brandt said. "Both fund groups have seen a significant jump in interest since the middle of last year," he said. "China funds got the initial jump but U.S. came roaring back." Net cumulative flows to U.S. stock funds since the beginning of 2020 were negative until November, according to EPFR data. The flows turned positive in the weeks following the U.S. presidential election, and reached $170 billion in the week ended April 7. In contrast, Chinese stock funds saw net positive cumulative flows for much of last year that exceeded U.S. levels — until December. Net cumulative flows to Chinese stock funds as of the week ended April 7 were just $29.78 billion, according to EPFR. The data company is a subsidiary of Informa Financial Intelligence and claims to tracks over 100,100 investment funds worldwide with more than $34 trillion in total assets. While U.S. stocks have climbed to fresh records this year, the Shanghai composite is little changed since December. Millions of new investors piled into the mainland stock market last year amid a surge in local stocks, stirring concerns of excessive speculation. In the last several weeks, Chinese authorities have warned repeatedly of financial market risks. Analysts have said Beijing's 6% GDP growth target for the year and other economic indicators signal that rather than focusing on high-speed growth, policymakers are intent on cracking down on long-term problems such as high reliance on debt. "We have seen flows to China funds tail off recently," Brandt said. "It seems there's a certain amount of skepticism even though headline growth numbers seem pretty impressive compared to everywhere else, China is still seen as vulnerable (if) monetary conditions tighten before the end of the year." Still, he expects funds will continue buying Chinese assets given strong demand from retail investors since the middle of last year. History indicates it would take an extreme event to dent that retail interest. Brandt said the last time there was such a surge in retail buying, it didn't end until the mainland Chinese stock market crashed in 2015. The Chinese government would also like to boost investor participation in the local stock market by making it easier for companies to go public, and encouraging foreign institutions to invest. — CNBC's Yen Nee Lee contributed to this report.
ByteDance, Meituan and ten other major Chinese technology companies pledged Wednesday to comply with anti-monopoly rules, according to the State Administration for Market Regulation. A day earlier, the regulator warned 34 Chinese "internet platforms" in a meeting to learn from the crackdown on Alibaba and submit a plan for compliance with anti-monopoly practices within a month. Wednesday's announcements are the first in a series of such pledges set to come over the next three days, the regulator said.	BEIJING — ByteDance, Meituan and ten other major Chinese technology companies pledged Wednesday to comply with anti-monopoly rules, according to statements shared by the national market regulator. Following the announcement, Chinese tech companies rose in Hong Kong trading Wednesday, recovering from a sell-off the prior day on news of heightened regulatory scrutiny. Meituan shares rose 4%, Baidu gained 3% and JD.com climbed 2%. Tencent rose 1.8%, while Alibaba rose about 1.5%. The stock moves come as Chinese authorities have ramped up their pressure on the country's fast-growing tech giants. Regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion over the weekend for stifling competition in online retail, then met with affiliate Ant on Monday and ordered it to restructure as a financial holding company . Then on Tuesday, the State Administration for Market Regulation warned 34 Chinese "internet platforms" in a meeting to learn from the crackdown on Alibaba and submit a plan for compliance with anti-monopoly practices within a month. Chinese regulators have focused their attention in recent months on Jack Ma's e-commerce giant and its fintech affiliate Ant Group, whose giant IPO was abruptly suspended in November. Authorities had begun investigating Alibaba in December, primarily for a practice of forcing merchants to choose one of two platforms , rather than allowing them to work with both. The details of the 12 corporate pledges released Wednesday varied by line of business, and generally discussed efforts to support fair competition and protection of consumer data. The companies listed included Baidu, JD.com, Meituan, antivirus software company Qihoo 360, Twitter-like social media platform Sina Weibo, TikTok parent ByteDance, group buying e-commerce site Pinduoduo , electronics retailer Suning and e-commerce company Vipshop . The announcements are the first in a series of such pledges set to come over the next three days, the regulator said. Other U.S. or Hong Kong-traded names mentioned in Tuesday's list of 34 internet platforms that were not included in Wednesday's initial round included iQiyi , Bilibili, Kuaishou, Mogu and 58.com. — CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.
U.S. President Joe Biden will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Friday, China's rise on the global stage will feature highly on the two leaders' meeting agenda, political analysts say. One possible outcome of the summit is a U.S.-Japan infrastructure plan focusing on high-quality projects that will rival China's Belt and Road Initiative, Nikkei Asia reported last week.	U.S. President Joe Biden will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Friday — and political analysts say China's growing influence will likely be high on the agenda. The two leaders will gather in Washington in what will be the U.S. president's first in-person summit with a foreign leader since his January inauguration. The meeting comes as the U.S. seeks to challenge China on issues ranging from human rights to unfair trade practices. "Rebuilding US alliances and competing with China are the core of Biden's foreign policy. The in-person meeting with Suga signals that Japan is a linchpin of both efforts," Jonathan Wood, director and lead U.S. analyst at consultancy Control Risks, told CNBC in an email. Biden and Suga are expected to discuss U.S.-Japan security partnership and other potential areas of cooperation during their meeting. That could include climate change, the Covid-19 pandemic and stability in the Taiwan Strait, said analysts. One possible outcome of the summit is an infrastructure plan focusing on high-quality projects such as high-speed 5G internet and clean energy, Nikkei Asia reported last week. Such a U.S.-Japan infrastructure cooperation could rival China's massive Belt and Road Initiative , the report said. The Belt and Road Initiative is  China's ambitious program to build physical and digital infrastructure that connects hundreds of countries from Asia to the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Many critics consider it Chinese President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy to expand his country's global influence. "Establishing an alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative is important to Biden's overall foreign policy agenda in the Indo-Pacific," Neil Thomas, an analyst at risk consultancy Eurasia Group, told CNBC via email. "That's because the best way for Washington to compete with Beijing's economic influence in the Indo-Pacific is to offer a more attractive development option to countries in the region," he added. Even before he was elected as president, Biden had criticized China for financing dirty fossil fuel projects through the Belt and Road Initiative. He brought up the possibility of working with allies to offer alternative sources of financing for lower-carbon energy projects. Japan is an important U.S. ally in Asia, where Chinese influence has grown over the last few years. The Biden administration has prioritized Japan in its diplomatic activities in Asia-Pacific. Last month, Biden met virtually with leaders of the so-called Quad alliance , of which Japan is a member. Some analysts said the informal strategic alliance — which includes the U.S., Australia and India — could be a way to counter China's influence. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin also visited Tokyo to meet with their Japanese counterparts last month. But  Japan treads a fine line between the U.S. — its main security partner, and China — its largest economic partner. And the potential for the U.S. and Japan to become closer is not lost on Beijing. Last week, China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi in a phone call that "Japan should view China's development with a more positive mentality." Prior to Wang's remarks, Beijing criticized the U.S.-Japan joint statement issued during Blinken and Austin's visit to Tokyo. The statement raised concerns about Chinese behavior in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and the South China Sea that was "inconsistent with the existing international order." Beijing shot back, saying the statement "maliciously attacks" China's foreign policy and "flagrantly interferes" with its domestic affairs. For Japan, "balancing between the US and China right now requires a precise understanding of the intention and scope of US measures," said Wood of Control Risks. Eurasia Group's Thomas said Japan would stop short of supporting U.S. position on human rights issues and policies to selectively "decouple" from the Chinese economy.
The People's Bank of China released a working paper late Wednesday that discussed how the country's aging population problems are worse than that of other nations. The central bank paper also compared China's situation to that of India and the United States. Authors of the report suggested China allow three or more children per household.	BEIJING — China may be one step nearer to abandoning its controversial policy of restricting childbirth. The central bank released a paper late Wednesday suggesting the country remove limits on how many children people can have, suggesting that China should "fully liberalize and encourage childbirth." As China's population began aging, Chinese authorities began several years ago to roll back the decades-old "one-child policy" and allow people to have two children. But births continued to fall, dropping 15% in 2020 in a fourth-straight year of decline. "In order to achieve the long-term goals in 2035, China should fully liberalize and encourage childbirth, and sweep off difficulties (women face) during pregnancy, childbirth, and kindergarten and school enrollment by all means (possible)," four central bank researchers wrote in the English-language abstract to a working paper. The 22-page document was dated March 26 and shared publicly on Wednesday. The paper stated the authors' views do not represent that of the central bank. However, the call to drop restrictions on births marks the latest high-level discussion of how to address China's aging population problems. One of China's main concerns is the impact these demographic changes could have on economic development. In two dedicated sections of the paper, researchers from the People's Bank of China laid out how these demographic issues put China at an economic disadvantage to the U.S. and India. "If my country has narrowed the gap with the U.S. over the past 40 years by relying on cheap labor and the bonus of a huge population, what can it rely on in the next 30 years? This is worth thinking over," the authors wrote in Chinese, according to a CNBC translation. They noted how the U.S. benefits from immigration even as China's population ages. Meanwhile, India's population and workforce will soon surpass that of China, they said. From 2019 to 2050, China's population will decline by 2.2% while that of the U.S. will increase by 15%, the paper said, citing UN estimates. The authors added that the percentage of China's work force is dwindling and it will lose its edge over that of the U.S. in the next few decades. In 2019, China's workforce as a proportion of the total population was 5.4 percentage points higher than the U.S. However, by 2050, China's workforce proportion will be 1.3 percentage points smaller than the U.S., the paper said. In a plan released in March for economic development for the next five years and beyond, Beijing said countering the effects of the aging population is one of its priorities. However, they stopped short of removing a ban on Chinese families from having more than two children. Educational and technological advances are insufficient to counter the decline in population, and China should remove restrictions on births, the authors wrote. "If there's slight hesitation, (we) will miss the precious window of opportunity for birth policy to respond to the demographic transition, and repeat the mistake of developed countries." The paper discussed generally how China's aging population problem is more severe than that of developed countries. In particular, the authors noted that developed countries with an aging population problem tend to be wealthier with a per capita GDP of at least $2,000, while China's is half that at $1,000. And once the older segment of the population begins to sell property, stocks and bonds to finance their retirement, the ratio will be close to that of a labor force that is buying those assets, which could result in increased pressure on prices, the paper said. Chinese authorities are set to release results from a once-a-decade census later this month.
From the GameStop stock trading frenzy earlier this year to digital currency exchange Coinbase's listing Wednesday, individuals are increasingly interested in playing capital markets, which are now easily accessible through a variety of mobile apps. Two Chinese-run stock trading apps plan to tap new users in Singapore and the U.S.	BEIJING — Chinese-run stock trading apps are riding a surge of global interest in day trading, as competition grows for Robinhood. Futu and Tiger Brokers , both listed in the U.S., launched a few years ago as apps allowing Chinese users to trade U.S. or Hong Kong stocks. Now both are forecasting hundreds of thousands of new users this year — mostly from outside China. From the GameStop stock trading frenzy earlier this year to digital currency exchange Coinbase's  listing Wednesday , individuals are increasingly interested in playing capital markets, which are now easily accessible through a variety of mobile apps. Here's how much analysts expect the Chinese players in this industry to climb.
GDP soared 18.3% in the first three months of the year from a year ago, China's National Bureau of Statistics said Friday. That's slightly below expectations of a 19% increase. The surge in growth comes off a contraction in the first quarter of last year, when the economy shrank by 6.8% during the height of the domestic outbreak of Covid-19. First-quarter GDP grew 0.6% from the fourth quarter, a slowdown from a 2.6% quarterly increase in the last three months of 2020.	BEIJING — China reported first-quarter gross domestic product a touch below expectations as industrial production disappointed but retail sales beat. GDP soared 18.3% in the first three months of the year from a year ago, China's National Bureau of Statistics said Friday. That's slightly below expectations of a 19% increase, according to analysts polled by Reuters. The surge in growth comes off a contraction in the first quarter of last year, when the economy shrank by 6.8% during the height of the domestic outbreak of Covid-19. China was the first country to deal with the disease, and the economy returned to growth by the second quarter of last year. GDP expanded 10.3% in the first quarter when compared with the same period in 2019, the statistics bureau said. China also said retail sales rose 34.2% in March, topping expectations of 28% growth. Industrial production rose 14.1% in March, missing Reuters' prediction of 17.2% growth. The slower growth in industrial production came despite more workers staying put during the Spring Festival and not traveling home for what can be a month-long holiday. The statistics bureau cautioned in an English-language statement that the spread of Covid-19 globally and the "international landscape is complicated with high uncertainties and instabilities." "The foundation for domestic recovery is yet to be consolidated and long-standing structural problems remain prominent with new situations and issues arising from development," the bureau said. The urban surveyed unemployment rate ticked lower in March to 5.3%, but that of China's youngest workers aged 16 to 24 remained a high 13.6%, the data showed. "Young people's employment problem still needs a period of time to be absorbed," said Liu Aihua, spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics, according to a CNBC translation of her Mandarin-language remarks. "The total pressure in this aspect does exist." She added that other surveys have found a shortage in general workers and high-skilled talent. Liu said the bureau recently found in a survey of more than 90,000 industrial businesses that a historically high ratio of 44% said hiring was their biggest problem. Friday's data release pointed to steady but slower growth for China's economy as it moves beyond the initial burst of growth following the pandemic. First quarter GDP grew 0.6% from the fourth quarter, a slowdown from a 2.6% quarterly increase in the last three months of 2020. "We do not expect China's policymakers to rush into any meaningful tightening, considering that the recovery is still facing headwinds and uncertainties ahead (e.g., domestic demand still quite subdued, consumption recovery remains gradual, and exports that saw extraordinary growth rates at the beginning of this year may later face competition from other re-opening economies)," Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance, said in a statement. Investment in manufacturing fell 2% on an annualized basis over the last two years, which the statistics bureau spokesperson on Friday attributed to persistent business difficulties and lack of investment confidence.
Hong Kong businesses are facing a "compounded new normal" as the city confronts challenges on multiple fronts, according to the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. The ongoing Covid-19 crisis, along with the recent passing of the national security law and the troubled U.S.-China trade relations, are among the list of top concerns for companies based in the city, says Tara Joseph.	Hong Kong businesses are facing a "compounded new normal" as the city confronts challenges on multiple fronts, according to the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. The ongoing Covid-19 crisis, along with the recent passing of the national security law and troubled U.S.-China trade relations, are among the list of top concerns for companies based in the Asian financial hub, Tara Joseph told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Thursday. "Hong Kong over the last two years has had a compounded new normal. We're dealing with Covid. We've got lots of change in the terms of Hong Kong being at an inflection point politically," she said, referring to the new national security law China passed for Hong Kong last year  and the overhaul to its electoral system last month. The changes could further curtail the city's freedoms, critics say . Joseph added these factors were further complicated by the China-U.S. friction — in terms of trade and politics. "All of those items are at the top of the list for businesses here," she said. The world's two largest economies signed a phase one trade agreement in January , bringing some reprieve to the tensions of the last two years. While the Biden administration has vowed to use "all available tools" to counter China's unfair trade practices , it has yet to make clear its position on how it will handle tariffs with China that have hurt businesses in both countries. "Let's take sanctions, for example, tit-for-tat between the U.S. and China. Those add to risks of being here," noted Joseph. She said companies in Hong Kong are "rethinking, potentially also re-rating and measuring risk here now." While Hong Kong has been able to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, Joseph argued the city's restrictive travel and strict quarantine measures have caused businesses to re-evaluate their presence in the city for the long-term. "The Covid issue and the quarantines bring it down to a personal level," she said. Those living in Hong Kong have not been able to visit their families and "that starts to become a personal concern." "That's where we're seeing people start to question how long they can stay here. And whether being here is going to be effective for them long term," Joseph said. And that could hurt Hong Kong's reputation as a global financial hub. "Hong Kong is also viewed as a place where you connect to travel, where you're able to have freedom of movement. And if we're not able to do that, it's going to affect the competitiveness of the city. So that is a growing concern," noted Joseph. 
In the deepening ties between China and Russia, President Joe Biden faces a nightmare scenario that could prove to be the most significant and underrecognized test of his leadership yet. The scale and intensity of the latest military moves by China and Russia in Taiwan and Ukraine, respectively, demand immediate attention.	President Joe Biden faces a nightmare scenario of global consequence: stepped up Chinese-Russian strategic cooperation aimed at undermining U.S. influence and at upending Biden's efforts to rally democratic allies. It is the most significant and underrecognized test of Biden's leadership yet: It could be the defining challenge of his presidency. This past week, Russia and China simultaneously escalated their separate military activities and threats to the sovereignty of Ukraine and Taiwan respectively — countries whose vibrant independence is an affront to Moscow and Beijing but lies at the heart of U.S. and allies' interests in their regions. Even if Moscow's and Beijing's actions do not result in a military invasion of either country, and most experts still believe that is unlikely, the scale and intensity of the military moves demand immediate attention. U.S. and allied officials dare not dismiss the certainty that Russia and China are sharing intelligence or the growing likelihood that they increasingly are coordinating actions and strategies. "That [Russian] buildup has reached the point that it could provide the basis for a limited military incursion," William J. Burns, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, told the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee this week. "It is something not only the United States but our allies have to take very seriously." On China, the annual U.S. Threat Assessment of the intelligence community said: "China is attempting to exploit doubts about U.S. commitment to the region, undermine Taiwan's democracy, and extend Beijing's influence." Lost in media coverage of the report was a warning about "Russia's growing strategic cooperation with China — to achieve its objectives." Seen independently, the Chinese and Russia challenges would be a handful for any U.S. president. Should China and Russia act more cohesively and coherently, and you've got a narrative more consequential than any Tom Clancy novel's plot. It's a scenario for which the U.S. and its allies lack a strategy or even a common understanding. For any who doubt Sino-Russian ambitions, one of my favorite places to read Chinese tea leaves is the Global Times, often a mouthpiece for Beijing's leadership. In an editorial late last month, under the headline "China-Russia ties deepen while U.S. and allies flail," it wrote : "The most influential bilateral relationship in Eurasia is the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era." In an only thinly veiled warning to Japan and South Korea, it wrote: "China and Russia understand the weight of their ties … To be honest, no country in the region can stand alone against either China or Russia, let alone fight against the powers at the same time. It would be disastrous for any country which tends to confront China and Russia through forging an alliance with the U.S." Asked last October about the possibility of a formal military alliance with China, Russian leader Vladimir Putin said , "Theoretically it is quite possible." In any case, there's nothing theoretical about the military escalations around Ukraine and Taiwan. Over the past week, Russia has amassed the largest concentration of troops along Ukraine's border since the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Ukrainian government officials say Russian President Vladimir Putin has brought more than 40,000 troops near Ukraine's eastern border for "combat training exercises" over a period of two weeks. At the same time, China has ramped up its military overflight incursions into Taiwan's air defense zone to unprecedented levels, having flown more than 250 sorties near the island this year. Last Monday, the Chinese military sent 25 warplanes Taiwan's way, a record high since Taiwan began disclosing figures last year. The Biden administration this week responded to Putin with the carrot of a summit meeting and the stick of new sanctions. On Tuesday, Biden called Putin, signaling he is not looking to escalate tensions with the leader he agreed was a "killer" only a month ago. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stood beside NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg as they condemned Russia's military buildup. The Biden administration's strongest rebuke came Thursday when it announced new economic sanctions against 38 Russian entities accused of election interference and cyberattacks, expelled ten diplomats, and introduced measures banning U.S. financial institutions from trading newly issued Russian state debt and bonds. China's incursions over Taiwan came shortly after the State Department issued guidelines loosening the rules for U.S. government officials engaging with Taiwan. Blinken has said the administration is concerned by China's "increasingly aggressive actions" and is committed to ensuring that Taiwan "has the ability to defend itself." The United States further demonstrated its support to Taiwan on Wednesday by sending an unofficial delegation consisting of a former U.S. senator and two former U.S. deputy secretaries of state to Taiwan. This unfolding great power drama couldn't come at a worse time for the Biden administration, whose officials won't even clock their 100 day in office until April 30. Yet that is probably the point for Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, as they look to gain advantage before Biden can secure surer footing through policy reviews and by staffing up key leadership positions. These real-world events also complicate the Biden administration's carefully laid plans to methodically sequence its actions, arguing reasonably that U.S. renewal is a prerequisite for effective global leadership. Biden's aim is to quell Covid-19 through accelerated vaccine distribution, to gin up economic momentum and competitiveness through $4 trillion of stimulus and infrastructure spending, and to restore relations with key allies, a goal reflected in Biden's meeting this week with Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide . The Biden administration also confronts a number of other foreign policy challenges simultaneously, ranging from the president's announcement this week that he would withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11 and efforts to restart nuclear talks with Iran despite last Sunday's attack on Tehran's Natanz nuclear enrichment facility . That's a lot for any new president to handle. However, how deftly Biden addresses the combined, growing challenge from Russia and China will shape our era.

Morgan Stanley released on April 13 an analysis of Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. and Hong Kong that have seen the greatest increase in short interest versus last month. Short selling refers to a trading strategy that allows investors to profit if a stock price drops. Two Chinese electric car start-ups topped the list.	Investors are stepping up their bets that two of China's high-flying electric car companies will see share prices drop. That's according to Morgan Stanley's analysis of the top Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. and Hong Kong that have seen the greatest increase in short interest versus last month. Short selling refers to a trading strategy that allows investors to profit if a stock price drops. The process involves borrowing shares, selling them and then buying them back later at a lower price. If the share price does not fall, the short seller will try to minimize losses by buying back shares, which now cost more. The April 13 report listed 10 names. Here are the top five, in descending order of greatest increase in short interest:
China's CanSino Biologics will start clinical trials for a Covid-19 vaccine administered through inhalation next week, the company's co-founder and Chief Executive Xuefeng Yu said on Sunday. Efficacy rates for China's Covid vaccines have been found to be lower than those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Such a vaccine could be more effective than those injected given that the coronavirus enters the human body through the airways, Yu told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal at the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan.	China's CanSino Biologics will be starting clinical trials for a Covid-19 vaccine that is administered through inhalation next week, the company's co-founder and Chief Executive Xuefeng Yu told CNBC on Sunday. Efficacy rates for China's Covid vaccines have been found to be lower than those developed by Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna . Earlier this month, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control publicly acknowledged that Chinese vaccines "don’t have very high protection rates" and that they were considering giving people different Covid shots to boost vaccine efficacy. Yu told CNBC that an inhaled vaccine could be more effective than those injected given that the coronavirus enters the human body through the airways. CanSinoBIO is jointly developing the inhalation vaccine with the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology. To be clear, the company's Adenovirus Type 5 Vector vaccine — or Ad5-nCoV — administered by injection was already approved for use in China and several other countries. Speaking to CNBC's Arjun Kharpal at the Boao Forum for Asia in the Chinese province of Hainan, Yu explained that theoretically, an inhaled vaccine could provide additional protection by activating antibodies or T cells — white blood cells that are vital to the immune system — in the airways. If that protection layer fails and the virus travels deeper into the body, other parts of the immune system could still fight the Covid virus, added Yu. "So you add more layers — makes sense, right? So that's why we're going through the mucosal route," he said. The CEO said the company has used the same concept to develop an inhalation vaccine for tuberculosis or TB. Trials conducted in Canada showed that the inhaled dosage for the TB vaccine needed to provide protection is "much, much less than the actual injection," he said. CanSinoBIO's single-dose injected Covid vaccine has been approved for use in several countries including China, Pakistan, Mexico and Hungary. The company said interim data from phase three clinical trials overseas showed its vaccine was 68.83% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 disease two weeks after one injection, while the rate fell to 65.28% after four weeks, reported Reuters. In comparison, updated data showed the Pfizer-BioNTech shot was 91% effective at preventing infection , while Moderna said its vaccine was more than 90% effective six months after the second shot. Yu said CanSinoBIO has studied adding a booster shot six months after the first injection, which managed to improve the immune response to the coronavirus. "That's also indicating that our vaccine could be boosted — whether it's being mixed with others or do it our own, I think that needs truly a scientific study. We need to actually have data to demonstrate which way could be better," said the CEO. Reuters reported on Monday that Chinese researchers are testing mixing Covid vaccines developed by CanSinoBIO and a unit of Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products. The trial, under way in the eastern city of Nanjing, is expected to involve 120 participants, said the report. China was the first country to report cases of Covid-19 in late 2019 and appears to have largely contained the outbreak. The country has said it aims to vaccinate 40% of its population by June.
President Biden has invited 40 world leaders to participate in this week's climate summit and is hoping to reach deals with some of the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters. The U.S. and China, the world's two biggest carbon polluters, have agreed to cooperate on climate change ahead of the two-day summit, though it's unclear if Chinese President Xi Jinping will participate. Biden is expected to unveil a new emissions reduction target for the Paris climate accord before or during the summit and pledge money to help less wealthy countries combat climate change.	President Joe Biden will host a closely watched global leaders climate summit on Thursday and Friday, during which the U.S. is expected to unveil an updated carbon emission reduction target and urge cooperation with other nations to combat the climate crisis. The president has invited 40 world leaders to the virtual summit and is hoping to reach deals with some of the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters. John Kerry, Biden's climate envoy, has been meeting with officials in China and elsewhere to garner support for the summit. The summit is an opportunity for the U.S. to rejoin global efforts to address climate change after the Trump administration pulled the country from the Paris climate accord and dismantled environmental regulations. The U.S. is the world's second-biggest carbon emitter, behind China. One of the expected actions from the White House is a new emissions reduction target for the Paris climate accord, the landmark agreement among 200 nations to reduce their emissions. Biden is expected to unveil the new target before or during the summit and pledge money to help less-wealthy countries combat climate change. Environmental groups and businesses have urged the president to set an emissions reduction target of at least 50% by 2030, which would double the country's previous commitment and help limit global temperature rise to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius below pre-industrial levels. The Obama administration made a goal to cut emissions 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025, but former President Donald Trump halted federal efforts to meet that target, pulled the U.S. from the Paris accord and implemented policies favoring fossil fuel producers. The Natural Resources Defense Council said in March that a 50% reduction target would "help pull the country out of the pandemic-induced recession by putting millions of Americans to work every year, avoid tens of thousands of premature deaths, and inspire more ambitious global climate action." And more than 300 executives last week urged Biden to nearly double U.S. targets to reduce emissions ahead of the summit, a push signaling the private sector's goals align with the administration's climate policies. Biden's climate agenda includes a major infrastructure package that invests in a clean energy transition, one of the country's largest federal efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions that would be paid for largely by raising corporate tax rates. The president has also vowed new regulations on fossil fuel producers and executive orders to reverse Trump's climate policy rollbacks on issues like clean water, air, chemicals and protection of land and wildlife. Still, a 50% reduction target would fall behind commitments by the U.K. and European Union, which have pledged to reduce emissions by 68% and 55% by 2030 . The U.S. and China, the world's two biggest carbon polluters, have agreed to cooperate on climate change but remain rivals on issues like trade, human rights, intellectual property and technology. Biden has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to the summit, though it's unclear if Xi leader will join in. Kerry and his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, said in a joint statement recently that the countries "are committed to cooperating with each other and with other countries to tackle the climate crisis, which must be addressed with the seriousness and urgency that it demands." Kerry also told CNBC earlier this month that the U.S., China and Europe, which account for about half of global emissions, must work together with other countries to deeply reduce emissions. "I think that this is a huge economic opportunity, not just for the United States, for people all around the world," Kerry said. China announced last year a commitment to reach peak emissions by 2030 and be carbon neutral by 2060. Biden has pledged to put the U.S. on a track to reach a zero-emissions electricity sector by 2035 and a net-zero economy by 2050. "This is not about China, this is not a counter to China," Kerry said. "This is about China, the United States, India, Russia, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Australia, a bunch of countries that are emitting a pretty sizable amount, the United States and China the most." The April summit comes before the next major U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, in November, where countries in the Paris agreement will provide updated emissions targets for the next decade.
Chinese President Xi Jinping will give a speech Thursday via video conference at a global leaders climate summit organized by U.S. President Joe Biden, state media said Wednesday. Reducing carbon emissions is one of the few areas China and the U.S. have said they could cooperate on, and aligns with Xi's announcement last year that the Asian nation aims to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030. Over the weekend, the U.S. and China jointly issued a broad statement on how the two countries would work together on tackling the "climate crisis, which must be addressed with the seriousness and urgency that it demands."	BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping will give a speech Thursday via video conference at a global leaders climate summit organized by U.S. President Joe Biden , state media said Wednesday. Many expected the leaders of the world's two largest economies — and the largest carbon polluters — to have their first meeting on the sidelines of the summit as tensions between the two countries simmer. Since taking office in January, Biden has called China the "most serious competitor" to the U.S. as he maintains former President Donald Trump's tough stance on Beijing. Xi and Biden spoke by phone in February, just ahead of China's Spring Festival. Reducing carbon emissions is one of the few areas China and the U.S. have said they could cooperate on, and aligns with Xi's announcement last year that the Asian nation aims to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030. Over the weekend, the U.S. and China jointly issued a broad statement on how the two countries would work together to "tackle the climate crisis." The statement followed two days of talks in Shanghai between U.S. special envoy for climate John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua. On Tuesday, Xi said at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia that China would support "green" development , particularly regarding the Belt and Road Initiative. Critics say the infrastructure development program is part of Beijing's attempt to increase its influence among less developed countries in the region. Xi did not mention the U.S. by name in his speech, but said big countries should behave responsibly and that China would not seek hegemony or "a sphere of influence." The announcement Wednesday that Xi would attend the climate summit comes more than three weeks since Biden invited 40 world leaders to attend the two-day meeting set for Thursday and Friday.
Goldman Sachs analysts predict that in four years, new government policies mean electric cars will account for a greater share of auto sales in Europe and the U.S., versus China, although it is the largest market. U.S.-listed Nio has said it would enter Europe in the second half of this year. And on Monday, co-founder and president Lihong Qin said the company expects to make an official announcement about such an expansion within a month. "It's no secret now that most of the China EV startups have global ambitions," said Tu Le, founder of Beijing-based advisory firm Sino Auto Insights. "That'll continue as these companies chase growth and value and see opportunity due to the lack of viable EVs products in the region."	SHANGHAI — After the last year of growth in the world's largest auto market, China's electric car start-ups are stepping up plans to take on Europe. Chinese authorities only began peeling back restrictions on full foreign ownership of local automobile production in the last few years. But more than a decade ago, Beijing began spending the equivalent of billions of dollars on developing its own electric vehicles. That's helped local players gain an edge in producing battery-powered cars, which they're now aiming to sell overseas. Goldman Sachs analysts predict that in four years, new government policies mean electric cars will account for a greater share of auto sales in Europe and the U.S. , versus China, although it is the largest market. U.S.-listed Nio has said it would enter Europe in the second half of this year. And on Monday, co-founder and president Lihong Qin said the company expects to make an official announcement about such an expansion within a month. He did not name a specific country, while stating that after Europe, Nio still intends to enter the U.S. market. Amid tensions with the U.S. and attempts to seal an investment deal with Europe, China exported 63,500 pure battery-powered electric vehicles during the first eleven months of last year, according to a January report from the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products. While Saudi Arabia and Egypt were the top destinations for Chinese cars overall last year, the report noted significant growth in vehicle exports to the U.K., Belgium and Germany. U.S.-listed Xpeng is already testing the waters in Norway, where the start-up delivered 100 units of its G3 electric SUV in December. Later this year, Xpeng hopes to see how customers in northern Europe respond to its P7 electric sedan, said He Xiaopeng, chairman and CEO. He is recruiting new staff and plans to set up a company in the region, before looking at western and eastern Europe. Another Chinese electric car start-up, Aiways, said it exported more than 1,000 vehicles to Israel and Europe in the first three months of this year. "It's no secret now that most of the China EV startups have global ambitions," said Tu Le, founder of Beijing-based advisory firm Sino Auto Insights. "That'll continue as these companies chase growth and value and see opportunity due to the lack of viable EVs products in the region." He said with enough local research, some of the Chinese companies could succeed in Europe. However, any growth in Chinese electric car sales to Europe remains a tiny fraction of the market. China accounted for less than 2% of the EU's passenger car imports in 2019 and the 865 million euros in value marks 79% growth from the prior year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association . In contrast, EU-owned automobile manufacturers made almost 6 million passenger cars in China in 2018, for almost a quarter of total Chinese car production, the association said. The Chinese start-ups' venture overseas comes as the market heats up at home. Nio's Qin said the entry of tech companies like Apple and Huawei into the industry are creating fierce competition for the car maker. On the automobile front, Tesla leads the market and is ramping up local production. Its Model 3 was the best-selling electric car in China last year, according to the China Passenger Car Association. Excluding two mini-electric cars, the association said the next best-selling vehicle in the category was the S model from Aion, a new energy brand spun-off from Chinese state-owned automaker GAC. A more expensive model from Nio ranked ninth, while Xpeng didn't make the top ten list. "Chinese consumers understand new energy vehicles more and more," said Aion's planning department director Qiu Liangping, according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks. In addition to ease of battery charging, he said Chinese buyers are looking for a better driving experience than that of fossil fuel-powered cars and internet-powered features. The brand also has its eye on the international market, Qiu said. Before the spin-off, Aion and GAC's Trumpchi brand were already selling cars in Israel, the Middle East and South America. As the automobile industry moves further into electric power, traditional U.S. and German car companies are launching their own electric vehicles — many in the Chinese market first. For example, General Motors' Cadillac brand unveiled its Lyriq electric car at the Shanghai auto show, with pre-orders in China beginning later this year, according to the company. Ford also used the show to reveal its locally made version of the Mustang Mach-e electric car, as well as a largely China-developed Evos SUV that will only be available in the country. Volkswagen revealed in Shanghai a third electric car for China, the ID.6. The German automaker aims that by 2030, at least 70% of its cars sold in Europe in electric, and at least 50% for cars sold in North America and China.
At the auto show in Shanghai this week, Chinese electric car start-up Xpeng revealed its second prototype for a flying vehicle the company claims has already undergone eight years of development. Hangzhou, China-based Geely, which owns Volvo, also showed off an "air taxi" developed by its joint venture partner Volocopter. BYD, backed by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett, plans to focus on road transportation right now.	SHANGHAI – Flying cars may have made headlines at this year's Shanghai Auto Show, but China's BYD — which is backed by Warren Buffett — is sticking to ground vehicles for now. This week, Chinese electric car start-up Xpeng debuted its second prototype for a flying vehicle the company claims has already undergone eight years of development. The new model resembles a flying car more than the initial version revealed in Beijing in September, which looked more like a human-carrying drone. Xpeng isn't the only one looking to the skies. Companies including Hyundai, German start-up Lilium, and China-based Ehang are developing flying vehicles that can carry individuals. Hangzhou, China-based Geely, which owns Volvo, showed off in Shanghai an "air taxi" developed by its joint venture partner Volocopter. One of the companies' selling points for flying vehicles is the country's growing urban street traffic. However, while the level of consumer demand remains unclear, regulation has prevented wider use of flying cars. But there are many ways to fix the problem of street congestion, said Li Yunfei, a spokesperson for BYD, in comments that CNBC translated from Mandarin. "Right now," he said, "we're more focused on road transportation." Li said the flying models aren't all that different from helicopters. Backed by investing guru Buffett, BYD sold more than 100,000 cars in the first quarter, more than half of which were new energy vehicles, a category which includes pure electric and hybrid cars. The company announced at the auto show a new version of its electric car operating system that comes with its internally developed "Blade" battery. BYD plans to sell this battery system to third-party automakers and already counts state-owned high-end Chinese car maker Hongqi as customer for the Blade battery, Li said. Last summer, BYD's luxury Han sedan became the company's first car to use the Blade battery. The vehicle has become one of the most popular in the new energy category, ranking third in sales nationwide during the first quarter. Only the Hongguang Mini EV and Tesla 's Model 3 outsold it, according to the China Passenger Car Association's sales rankings. Li said 70% of Han vehicles sold are pure-electric battery-powered models. Beginning this month, BYD said it plans to use the "Blade" battery in all of its pure-electric cars.
Called the Hongguang Mini EV Cabrio, the convertible will begin mass production next year, according to a release. The car is the latest from the popular Hongguang Mini EV line developed by General Motors' joint venture with Wuling Motors and state-owned SAIC Motor. The initial Hongguang Mini EV model soared in popularity after launching in July and has sold more cars than Tesla's Model 3 in the first quarter, according to the China Passenger Car Association.	SHANGHAI – General Motors ' joint venture in China is launching a miniature electric convertible under a low-cost brand that has soared in popularity in the last year. Called the Hongguang Mini EV Cabrio, the convertible will begin mass production next year, according to a release. Details on pricing and availability weren't available at the time of the vehicle's unveiling at the Shanghai auto show this week. The car is the latest from the popular Hongguang Mini EV line developed by General Motors ' joint venture with Wuling Motors and state-owned SAIC Motor . GM China has a 44% stake , while SAIC holds 50.1%, according to GM's website. The initial Hongguang Mini EV launched in July with a starting price of just a couple thousand U.S. dollars. It has sold more than 270,000 units over 270 days, according to the company. That Mini EV was second only to Tesla's Model 3 by the number of new energy cars sold in China last year and climbed past it into first place during the first quarter, according to figures from the China Passenger Car Association. Another new model from Hongguang Mini EV, the Macaron, has received more than 45,000 orders in just 10 days, according to a release. General Motors and its joint ventures delivered more than 780,000 vehicles in China in the first quarter of 2021, with the Hongguang Mini EV accounting for about 9%, according to GM.
A woman who claimed to be a Tesla customer protested an alleged brake failure in her car at the company's booth at the Shanghai auto show. Tesla claimed the woman had a collision due to a speeding incident and has been negotiating with her since February. Chinese state media branded the company's response as "arrogant" and regulators are increasing their scrutiny of the company.	GUANGZHOU, China — Tesla faces mounting pressure in China as state media and regulators criticize the electric car maker following a woman's protest at a major auto show this week. Tesla could be facing one of its worst public relations crises in China, a market investors see as critical for its growth. On Monday, a woman who claimed to be a Tesla customer stood atop one of the company's cars at the Shanghai auto show with a T-shirt that read "brakes don't work." She was protesting an alleged brake failure in her car — an issue other Chinese social media users claiming to be Tesla drivers have complained about in the last several months. A video of the incident went viral on Chinese social networks and was picked up by state media . On Tuesday, Shanghai police identified the protester by her surname Zhang and said she was sentenced to five days detention for disturbing public order. Tesla alleged the woman was involved in a collision in February due to "speeding violations" and that in their two months of negotiations, she would not allow a third-party inspection but insisted on a refund for the car. Tesla's vice president for China, Tao Lin, claimed in an interview Monday with Chinese financial news publication Caijing that the woman hoped for a high level of compensation, and the company doesn't have any reason to give it to her. In a post on Twitter-like service Weibo, Tesla said it would not compromise with "unreasonable demands." State media and a government agencies were quick to reprimand Tesla. State-run news outlets published a string of editorials, while the Chinese government's central disciplinary commission issued a warning statement. One state media article titled "Three lessons Tesla ought to learn" advised the U.S.-based electric auto maker to respect the Chinese consumer market, according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese-language text. "The arrogant and overbearing stance the company exhibited in front of the public is repugnant and unacceptable, which could inflict serious damage on its reputation and customer base in the Chinese market," the state-backed tabloid Global Times said in a separate opinion piece published Wednesday. Tesla apologized in a statement for not solving the car owner's problems in a timely manner. In Weibo posts on Monday and Tuesday, Tesla said it's willing to cooperate with authorities. The company said it will carry out "self-examination and self-correction" to "rectify" problems with its customer service process. On Thursday, Tesla said it handed over raw vehicle data to Zhang from 30 minutes before the crash in question took place. The company has also been in communication with two market regulators. Tesla has been a poster child for Beijing's efforts to demonstrate that China is letting more foreign businesses into its relatively closed market. Tesla has stepped up its focus on China in the last two years. With the support of the government, Tesla broke ground on a major Shanghai factory in 2019 and last year began delivering Model 3 vehicles made at that site to customers in China. Tesla's China sales more than doubled in 2020 , and the Model 3 was the best-selling electric car in the country . CEO Elon Musk even met with Premier Li Keqiang in 2019. But with success comes scrutiny, especially as China's homegrown companies look for a larger slice of the growing electric vehicle market. China's favorable policies toward electric cars have spurred the creation of a number of start-ups hoping to compete with Tesla such as Nio and Xpeng Motors , although their sales are still far behind Tesla's. "Letting the market leader in was very much in China's interest, but letting the market leader dominate the market is not in China's interest," said Bill Russo, founder and CEO of consulting and investment firm Automobility Limited. Russo noted that companies including Volkswagen and Daimler's Mercedes unit have gone through similar periods of scrutiny in the past. Negative press about Tesla in China has increased in recent months. Earlier this year, a Tesla Model 3 reportedly exploded in a Shanghai parking garage , while a state media article said there were at least 10 reports in 2020 of Tesla drivers in the country losing control of their cars. China has also reportedly restricted the use of Tesla cars among state and military personnel over concerns that the vehicle's sensors could record images of their surrounding locations. Musk said his company would be shut down if its cars could be used to spy . China's market regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation, met with Tesla's local subsidiaries in February over increased consumer reports of vehicle problems. On Wednesday, the regulator issued a statement saying it places high importance on the Shanghai auto show incident. The authority said it has instructed local regulators to protect consumer interests. Musk has looked to fend off the scrutiny. In March, he gave an interview to state broadcaster CCTV saying that the future of China is "going to be great" and that the country will be Tesla's "biggest market." — Evelyn Cheng contributed from Beijing; CNBC's Yin Hon contributed to this report.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission announced last Friday a series of updated guidelines for companies seeking to list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange's STAR market. One of the guidelines was that financial technology companies were banned from listing on the Nasdaq-like exchange. According to EY Asia-Pacific IPO Leader Ringo Choi, few firms in the financial technology sector have successfully managed to list on the mainland.	Months after the sudden suspension of Ant Group's highly-anticipated dual listing , China's financial technology companies are facing difficulties trying to go public in the mainland, analysts told CNBC. According to EY's Asia-Pacific IPO leader, Ringo Choi, few firms in the fintech sector have managed to list on mainland exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen. "For financial technology, you can see that ... some of the largest one(s), if they're competing with the bank or insurance company, they will have a hard time," Choi told CNBC. Last Friday, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced a series of updated guidelines for companies seeking to list on the Shanghai's STAR market — the Nasdaq-style tech board officially known as the Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board. One of the guidelines was that financial technology companies were banned from listing on the STAR board. "Real estate and firms mainly engaged in financial services and investment businesses are prohibited from listing on the Science and Technology Innovation Board," the CSRC said in the release. The latest development presents yet another obstacle for Chinese fintech companies looking to list on the mainland. It comes weeks after Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com withdrew the planned listing of its financial technology arm on the STAR market. The current IPO climate is a stark contrast to the situation less than six months ago , when a slew of Chinese start-ups were planning to list domestically. One such listing was the highly-anticipated public debut of Alibaba-affiliate Ant Group — poised at that time to become the world's largest IPO. Ant's planned listing — set to take place in both Shanghai and Hong Kong — was abruptly shelved days before the debut after top executives including its founder and controller, Jack Ma, were summoned by Chinese regulators for questioning. The unexpected suspension largely marked a turning point in Beijing's stance toward its domestic technology giants including fintech firms, which had enjoyed largely unencumbered growth for years. "The sentiment for this sector face(s) some questions," Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance Securities (Hong Kong), told CNBC. He said firms in the financial technology sector are now looking toward Ant's "rectifications" of its business as an "example" for others that are looking to list on the mainland. Earlier in April, Chinese regulators ordered Ant — which runs the massively popular mobile payments app Alipay in China — to revamp its business. Reuters reported over the weekend that the fintech powerhouse is exploring options for its founder Ma to divest his stake and give up control — but Ant swiftly denied those claims as "untrue and baseless" in a post from its official Twitter account. Financial technology firms that are currently facing a "closed door" trying to raise capital on the STAR board may seek listings elsewhere, said Pang. The U.S. and Hong Kong are still viable options for Chinese financial technology firms looking for alternative destinations to go public, according to the analysts. One example of a Chinese fintech firm that has successfully listed outside the mainland is Lufax , which had a U.S. IPO in late 2020 . The Securities and Exchange Commission will likely "give a pass" to Chinese firms wanting to list in the U.S. as long as the companies are able to meet the requirements of full disclosure, said EY's Choi. As for Hong Kong, the process may be "more stringent," but they still have a chance to go public too if the requirements are met. Still, potential delisting concerns for Chinese firms stateside may weigh on investor sentiment. Under a new law passed by the administration of Donald Trump , the SEC can stop the trading of securities that fail to meet its auditing requirements. — CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.
President Xi Jinping's China is negotiating trade and investment agreements around the world, but both Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. have grown allergic to such deals. A lack of a coherent U.S. policy challenging China might undermine early international wins by President Joe Biden's administration. While the Biden administration has put its trade agenda on hold, China marches forward — closing the deals and setting the standards that will shape the future.	The biggest hole in the Biden administration's otherwise encouraging efforts to better compete with China — a void that could undermine all the other pieces — is the lack of an international trade strategy. While President Xi Jinping's China accelerates his efforts to negotiate multilateral and bilateral trade and investment agreements around the world, both Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. have grown allergic to such arrangements. "The Chinese believe deeply in the significance of the correlation of forces, and they believe that correlation at the moment is in their favor," says Stephen Hadley, former national security advisor to President George W. Bush. If the U.S. fails to alter that Chinese conviction, it won't regain the leverage needed to deal with Beijing. "The most important missing element in changing that Chinese calculus is a trade strategy," Hadley says, one that could rally global allies, provide American jobs and growth, and counter escalating Chinese efforts to organize the world economy around itself. Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright once called the U.S. the world's "indispensable country," but Xi is now positioning China as the world's " indispensable economy ." By 2018, 90 countries in the world traded twice as much with China as with the U.S. By 2019, China surpassed the U.S. as the largest global recipient of foreign direct investment. The underlying message now is that China's market is so large, its liquidity so deep and its post-Covid-19 rebound so dramatic (up 18% in the first quarter ), that no reasonable country can resist its embrace. "In this age of economic globalization, openness and integration is an unstoppable historical trend," President Xi said this week to the Boao Forum for Asia. Without mentioning Washington by name, he said that "attempts to 'erect walls' or 'decouple' run counter to the law of economics and market principles. They would hurt others' interests without benefiting oneself." It is far too easy to punch holes in Xi's statement: China remains rife with market protections, and state intervention at home and abroad is growing. Intellectual property theft and cybercrimes continue. Yet without a modern, forward-looking trade strategy, the U.S. enters this global punch-up with one arm tied behind its back. "The U.S. and China are engaged in a strategic competition that will determine the shape of global politics this century," wrote Hank Paulson Jr., the former U.S. treasury secretary, in The Wall Street Journal. "But when it comes to trade, a critical dimension of that competition, America is ceding the field." That undermines early wins in the emerging Biden approach to China. First, Biden has profited from a bipartisan consensus, rare these days in Congress, about the urgency of rising to the Chinese challenge. Second, Biden has begun to rally friends and allies in Asia and Europe, who share his concerns about China. Biden in March convened the first-ever leaders meeting of "the Quad," including the U.S., India, Australia and Japan, constructed to balance China in the region. To address China's vast vaccine diplomacy, the countries agreed to distribute a billion doses of vaccines by 2022. Last week, Biden welcomed Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga as the first head of government to visit Washington. Their joint statement didn't mention China, but it did pledge "that free and democratic nations, working together" could act to resist "challenges to the free and open rules-based international order." They also spoke of ensuring peace across the Taiwan Strait, which is the first mention of Taiwan by a Japanese prime minister in a joint statement with a U.S. president since 1969. And for the first time ever, the EU on March 22 imposed economic sanctions on China over human rights violations in the autonomous region of Xinjiang, acting alongside the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. Third, the Biden administration's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus plan and pending $2.3 trillion in infrastructure-related investment will improve U.S. competitiveness through investments in human capital, physical infrastructure and advanced technology. The problem is that the same bipartisan consensus in Congress regarding the Chinese challenge is matched by a bipartisan allergy to the sorts of multilateral and bilateral trade and investment deals required to address Beijing's momentum. Last November, China was one of 15 Asia-Pacific countries, accounting for 30% of global GDP, that signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP. It was the first free-trade agreement of China with U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, creating history's largest trading bloc. China has also expressed interest in joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, CPTPP. That was the trade agreement signed by 11 countries after the Trump administration withdrew from the effort as one of its first acts of government. Should the RCEP agreement go into force, which is likely before January 2022, and if China is able to join the CPTPP, the international trade deal game in Asia would be largely over, and China will have won. At the same time, China is moving ahead on other fronts. In January, it closed the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investments (CAI), much to the consternation of incoming Biden administration officials. (Completion of that agreement has stalled in the European Parliament due to new Chinese sanctions on the EU.) But whatever happens in Brussels, most European countries are eager to close trade and investment agreements with China, which last year for the first time became the EU's largest trading partner. The real problem lies with Washington's lack of alternatives — driven by the mistaken narrative within both parties that globalization has worked against American interests and jobs. As the Republican Party morphed into the Trump party, it abandoned the type of free-trade policies that President Ronald Reagan embraced as "one of the key factors behind our nation's great prosperity." While President Barack Obama negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership during his presidency, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 opposed the agreement after having called it the "gold standard" only three years earlier. "Both Democrats and Republicans are now advocating 'a trade policy for the middle class,'" writes the Peterson Institute's Adam Posen in a compelling foreign affairs narrative debunking this approach. "In practice, this seems to mean tariffs and 'Buy American' programs aimed at saving jobs from unfair foreign competition." Instead, he writes, "Washington should enter into agreements that increase competition in the United States and raise taxation, labor and environmental standards. It is the self-deluding withdrawal from the international economy over the last 20 years that has failed American workers, not globalization itself." Instead, while the Biden administration has put its trade agenda on hold, China marches forward — closing the deals and setting the standards that will shape the future.

Huawei is boosting its efforts in areas such as cloud computing and smart cars hoping software becomes a larger part of its revenue mix in the future. The pivot to software comes after U.S. sanctions on Huawei have caused smartphone sales to plunge. Behind Huawei's push into software is also an attempt to insulate itself from potential geopolitics and any further actions from the U.S.	GUANGZHOU, China — Huawei is boosting its efforts in software areas like cloud computing and smart cars as U.S. sanctions hurt its hardware business. Last week, Arcfox, a brand under automaker BAIC Group, launched a car with Huawei's vehicle technology. It included a cockpit kitted out with HarmonyOS, the operating system Huawei launched in 2019 , as well as autonomous driving capabilities. Huawei will not be making cars and will instead focus on the technology that powers them. And on Sunday, Huawei launched some new cloud computing products as it looks to challenge China's market leader, Alibaba. Huawei said in a press release on Sunday that it hopes the focus on cloud will "eventually increase the proportion our software and service business has in our total revenue mix." The pivot to software comes after U.S. sanctions on Huawei have caused smartphone sales to plunge . The Chinese giant was put on a blacklist known as the Entity List in 2019 which restricted its access to some American technology. And last year, Washington moved to cut Huawei off form key semiconductor supplies . "Huawei is doubling down on pivoting to a software/cloud and services company," Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research, said. As a result of Washington's sanctions, Shah said the Chinese company is "unable to procure critical semiconductor components and related tech" from the U.S. "Huawei with this effort is becoming like Google," he said. Google makes the Android mobile operating system used by the majority of the world's smartphones. The tech giant is also working on in-car software and has a fast-growing cloud computing business . Huawei has also touted its HarmonyOS as being able to work across different devices from smartphones to TVs and cars. "The smartphone business is facing challenges, they have another mobile platform which is the car for them to utilize HarmonyOS. The car could be a big mobile platform to apply and use HarmonyOS," Will Wong, research manager at IDC said. In its pursuit of areas such as vehicles and cloud, Huawei will look to challenge some of China's biggest technology companies. Alibaba is the market leader in China for cloud computing. And in the vehicle space, a slew of companies are vying for a slice of the pie from established players like Baidu to new entrants such as Xiaomi . Behind Huawei's push into software is also an attempt to insulate itself from potential geopolitics and any further actions from the U.S. While Washington successfully hindered Huawei's access to chips, it could be a bigger challenge to hurt the software business. "It will be more protected when talking about geopolitics from the U.S.," IDC's Wong said. He noted that the chipsets required for vehicles require a less advanced manufacturing process too than smartphones.
Despite political tensions between the U.S. and China, Chinese start-ups remain intent on listing in New York. About 60 Chinese companies are planning to go public in the U.S. this year, said Vera Yang, chief China representative for the New York Stock Exchange. However, cautious investors are piling into just a few of the same companies, while post-IPO stock slumps are raising questions about whether valuations are fair.	BEIJING — Chinese companies are rushing to go public in the red-hot IPO market in the U.S. — before it loses steam. The first three months of the year marked the busiest quarter for overall U.S. initial public offerings since 2000, according to consulting firm EY. Despite the coronavirus pandemic and tensions between the U.S. and China, half of 36 foreign public listings in the U.S. during that time came from companies based in Greater China, EY said. More are coming. About 60 Chinese companies plan to go public in the U.S. this year, Vera Yang, chief China representative for the New York Stock Exchange, said Tuesday. "From our interaction with companies, our sense is they would like to lose no time (in listing)," Yang said in a Mandarin-language interview, translated by CNBC. She pointed to uncertainties such as those brought by the pandemic, and a likely tightening of monetary policy in the longer term that would reduce the availability of capital. Money has steadily entered the market since the pandemic, allowing 30 China-based companies last year to raise the most capital in U.S. IPOs since 2014, according to Renaissance Capital. The S&P 500 climbed to fresh record highs this year, while U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that monetary policy will remain loose in the near term. For Chinese start-ups, investors and businesses are looking to cash in. They're also looking past legislation passed under the Trump administration that would force U.S. exchanges to delist foreign companies that don't comply with three years of U.S. audits. Delisting concerns have calmed down since President Joe Biden took office in January, and market participants expect a compromise, said Blueshirt managing director Gary Dvorchak, who advises Chinese companies interested in listing in the U.S. "It's a tidal wave," he said of the Chinese IPO pipeline. "Our phone is ringing off the hook. We're trying to hire more people. We haven't seen anything like this since the Nasdaq bubble in '99," he said. "Makes me worried." In the late 1990s, a surge of speculation in new technology companies ranging from Pets.com to Cisco fed a U.S. stock market bubble that began to burst in 2000, in what came to be known as the "dotcom bubble." This year, investor caution about viable business ventures caused capital to pile into just a few of the same companies, rather than spreading out their bets. The trend holds in China, home to many of the world's so-called unicorns — or start-ups valued at $1 billion or more. Hongye Wang, China-based partner at venture capital firm Antler, said that anecdotally, more people are asking him for shares in unicorns than in earlier-stage start-ups. "A lot of companies cannot raise a lot of money, or their valuation(s) are decreasing. But if you look at the unicorns, especially the pre-IPO unicorns, their valuation is still crazy," he said. Just take popular Chinese soda water company Genki Forest, which earlier this month reportedly secured another capital injection — of $500 million — bringing its valuation to $6 billion. In contrast, one of the biggest fundraising rounds in yuan that week was a much smaller 600 million yuan ($92.3 million) series B injection into Abogen Biosciences, according to Crunchbase. In a sign that some valuations may be too high, many Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. and Hong Kong have slumped after their initial public offerings this year. For example, in February Chinese short-video app Kuaishou soared 160% to $300 a share in the biggest internet company IPO since Uber, and the largest Hong Kong debut since the pandemic. But its stock has struggled to build on those gains, and closed at $274 a share on Tuesday. "The after-IPO pricing trend is not as good as last year," said Ringo Choi, Asia-Pacific IPO leader at EY. He expects a slowdown in public offerings beginning in the third quarter of this year, especially if the macroeconomic environment takes a turn for the worse. For now, a few of China's largest start-ups are still in the IPO pipeline, although the timing is unclear. Beijing-based ByteDance, owner of popular short-video app TikTok, is the biggest unicorn in the world, while Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing ranks fourth, according to CB Insights. Investors are "supportive, but more selective" of Chinese companies that might be able to sustain high valuations, Yang said, citing conversations with various investment funds. She said that among China-based businesses listing in the U.S. this year, the first area of interest is a category known as technology, media and telecommunications. That's followed by consumer brands and business services, Yang said.
Starbucks said quarterly same-store sales growth of 91% in China — up from a contraction last year — missed expectations. Less than four months into 2021, Beijing-based business data company Qimingpian counts 14 fundraising deals in China's tea and coffee market. That's the same number as the country saw for all of 2019 and just shy of last year's total of 19, the data showed. "Entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in China" was one of the business risks Starbucks listed in its annual report filed in November.	BEIJING — Investors in China are stepping up their bets that locals will buy more beverages that aren't from Starbucks . The American coffee giant counts China as its fastest growing market and largest outside the U.S. While a quarterly earnings report Tuesday showed steady expansion, Starbucks said same-store sales growth of 91% in China — up from a contraction last year — missed expectations. The company attributed the miss to unexpected pandemic-related travel restrictions. But the market is heating up as investors have their eye on another trend: home-grown beverages. Less than four months into 2021, Beijing-based business data company Qimingpian counts 14 fundraising deals in China's tea and coffee market. That's the same number as the country saw for all of 2019 and just shy of last year's total of 19, the data showed. These deals include investments in Hey Tea and Nayuki, tea-based beverage companies that have each reportedly reached valuations of about $2 billion or more in the last several months. Foreign brands illycaffe and Tim Hortons are also raising money for their local ventures. Precise investment figures for the industry were difficult to pin down given the private nature of many of the deals, but different data sources all pointed to significant growth. In December, Chinese business news site 36kr reported that Shanghai-based Manner Coffee received another round of investment that valued it at more than $1 billion. The boutique coffee brand focuses on selling drinks out of small, take-out venues in business districts. "Entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in China" was one of the business risks Starbucks listed in its annual report filed in November . The company has full ownership of its stores in China, giving it a greater share of the profits — and risks — from the massive market. Guangzhou and Shenzhen have each seen thousands of coffee shops pop up in the last five years, according to data from Meituan, which runs a food delivery business and operates Dianping, China's version of Yelp. Shanghai remains the largest coffee market, with nearly 3 shops per 10,000 people versus a ratio of about 2 for Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Beijing, according to Meituan. Source: Meituan, with design by Shanghai Observer Starbucks retains the lead in China's specialist coffee and tea shop market with 36.4% of the market, according to Euromonitor figures for 2020. But the market for tea drinks was twice as large as that of coffee in China and that gap is expected to expand this year, Meituan said citing industry data. The company said the number of milk tea and fruit juice storefronts is about four times that of coffee shops. Hey Tea is second to Starbucks in China's specialist coffee and tea shop market, with an 8.8% share, according to Euromonitor. The Shenzhen-based company is best known for tea that comes with a cheese-like foamy layer of cream on top. Hey Tea is also climbing into the global market, with a 1.1% share of the category worldwide, according to Euromonitor.
Huawei said its revenues fell 16.5% year-on-year to 152.2 billion Chinese yuan ($23.5 billion) in the three months ending March 31. This was largely down to pain in Huawei's consumer business, which includes smartphones and other devices. Eric Xu, Huawei's rotating chairman, warned 2021 would be "another challenging year for us."	LONDON — Chinese tech giant Huawei said Wednesday that its revenues dropped sharply in the first quarter as U.S. sanctions took a toll on its business. Huawei's revenues fell 16.5% year-on-year to 152.2 billion Chinese yuan ($23.5 billion) in the three months ending March 31, according to unaudited financial results revealed by the company on Wednesday. It marks the second consecutive quarter in which Huawei's revenues declined. This was largely down to pain in Huawei's consumer business, which includes smartphones and other devices. Huawei hasn't been able to ship its phones with Google's licensed Android operating system since the companies parted ways in 2019. Huawei's smartphone shipments plunged 41% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The company sold its Honor budget smartphone brand to a consortium of investors last year. In 2019, Huawei was added to a U.S. trade blacklist called the Entity List which restricts American firms from exporting technologies to certain foreign entities. And in 2020, the U.S. moved to cut Huawei off from key chip supplies it needs for its smartphones. "2021 will be another challenging year for us, but it's also the year that our future development strategy will begin to take shape," Eric Xu, Huawei's rotating chairman, said in a statement. "We thank our customers and partners for their ongoing trust. No matter what challenges come our way, we will continue to maintain our business resilience. Not just to survive, but do so sustainably." Huawei said it actually managed to increase its profit margin by about 3.8 percentage points year-on-year to 11.1%. This was in part down to the $600 million Huawei received in patent royalties in the quarter. In March, Huawei said it would begin charging smartphone makers a royalty to use its patented 5G technology. Huawei has thousands of declared 5G patent families, and the company is hoping this part of its business can provide it with a new revenue stream as other parts of its business falter. Huawei said Wednesday that it would ramp up investment in software going forward to incorporate software and services in its revenue mix. The company has been boosting its efforts in software , including areas like cloud computing and smart cars, as U.S. sanctions hurt its hardware unit. - CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.
In his first 100 days as president, Joe Biden has made one thing clear — he wants to make sure the U.S. outcompetes China on a number of fronts, with technology being front and center. Biden has called for billions of dollars of investments in key technology areas from semiconductors to artificial intelligence. While maintaining Trump-era sanctions on Chinese companies, Biden has looked to form strategic alliances on technology with allied nations.	GUANGZHOU, China — In his first 100 days as president, Joe Biden has made one thing clear — he wants to make sure the U.S. outcompetes China on a number of fronts, with technology being front and center. His policies continue the Trump-era hardline on export controls to Chinese technology companies but adds some new elements — collaboration with allies in areas seen as critical, such as semiconductors and a focus on beefing up domestic capabilities. "The priority is on domestic innovation and forging technology alliances to coordinate confrontation against China in the tech domain," Paul Triolo, head of the geo-technology practice at Eurasia Group, said. The Biden administration has kept some Trump-era export bans on Chinese companies. Under Trump, telecommunication equipment maker Huawei and China's largest chipmaker SMIC were put on the so-called "entity list," which restricts American firms from exporting technology to companies on this blacklist. Last year, the Trump administration introduced a rule that effectively cut Huawei off from critical semiconductor supplies, a move which has hurt the technology giant's smartphone business . The U.S. maintains Huawei is a national security threat, a claim the Chinese firm has repeatedly denied. For Trump, ensuring U.S. technology did not make it into the hands of Chinese companies was key, especially in critical areas like chips. While Biden has kept these rules in place, he has also announced policies aimed at boosting American innovation. "Where the Trump administration tended to focus on defensive measures (e.g., restrictions on Chinese military companies), early messaging about Biden's approach suggests that it pairs those with more offensive, or proactive ones — investments, for example, in alternatives to China," said Emily de La Bruyere, co-founder of consultancy Horizon Advisory. In his American Jobs Plan, Biden calls on Congress to make a $180 billion investment in advancing "U.S. leadership in critical technologies and upgrade America's research infrastructure." There is also a call to invest $50 billion in manufacturing and research, via the bipartisan CHIPS Act. Earlier this month, a number of Democrat and Republican lawmakers reintroduced the Endless Frontier Act to the legislative process. This proposes changing the name of the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) to the National Science and Technology Foundation (NSTF). This is an independent agency of the U.S. government aimed at advancing scientific research. A technology directorate would be set up under the newly-named NSTF and would be given $100 billion over five years to "reinvigorate American leadership in the discovery and application of key technologies that will define global competitiveness." The directorate would fund research in 10 key areas including artificial intelligence, semiconductors, robotics, materials sciences, advanced communications technologies, among others. The focus on domestic investment but also maintaining export controls is "primarily driven by the perceived need to protect the U.S. company technology leadership in key areas such as semiconductor manufacturing," Triolo said. But "raising new barriers around U.S. technologies and essentially weaponizing key supply chains as part of an effort to contain China's rise are (also) part of the Biden strategy," he added. While Biden's announcements so far have been wide-ranging, there has been an area at the top of his administration's mind — semiconductors. These components are critical for powering so many of the devices we use. The focus is partly to address the global chip shortage which has impacted carmakers and other industries too. In doing so, Biden hopes to secure supply chains to ensure that the semiconductor requirements of the U.S. are met. But the longer term goal is to boost the U.S.'s own ability to manufacture semiconductors, a part of the supply chain that has heavily shifted to Asia and in particular Taiwan and South Korea . In February, Biden signed an executive order which involves a review of the semiconductor supply chain to identify risks. As part of a broader push to onshore manufacturing, U.S. firm Intel last month announced plans to spend $20 billion to build two new chip factories and said it will act as a foundry . Another difference between Biden's approach to China and technology and Trump's is the focus on "multilateralism," according to Bruyere. Earlier this month, Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide, said the U.S. and Japan would work together on research and development in areas such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology. The two nations also said they will partner on "supply chains, including on semi-conductors, promoting and protecting the critical technologies that are essential to our security and prosperity." Biden will also meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in in Washington next month. Semiconductors and tech issues are expected to be part of their conversation. Both Japan and South Korea are key parts of the semiconductor supply chain and are growing players in other critical areas of technology, including robots and next-generation 5G mobile networks. "The competition between the U.S. and China is an ideological one. China is trying to shape a new global order; it's up to Washington to lead the development of a better alternative," Bruyere said. "For that alternative actually to be better — and convincingly so — it has to be multilateral. It has to incorporate the interests and voices of global stakeholders." Biden's focus on technology in his first 100 days of presidency is in part a response to China's growing technological ambition. In its five-year development plan, Beijing said it would make "science and technology self-reliance and self-improvement a strategic pillar for national development." The plan looks to boost research into "frontier technology," seven areas from quantum computing and semiconductors, that China sees as being key. For the past few years, China has been trying to catch up with the U.S. and other nations in the area of semiconductors, though it remains far behind . Meanwhile, China is also pushing to play a greater role in the development of global standards that underpin the development of future technologies. Horizon Advisory's Bruyere said questions still remain over Biden's approach to China's moves so far including whether the administration will focus on broad technology areas or "lower-value add areas like machine tools and fundamental, primary raw materials like lithium" which China currently dominates. Another question is whether the U.S. can compete with China "for scaled, global applications of the technological capabilities it's building at home." Technology standards is one area. "The biggest question right now is whether the U.S. is able to adopt the comprehensive strategic framing necessary effectively to compete with China's approach," Bruyere said.
U.S. President Joe Biden called Thursday for America to work together against competition from China. Chinese President Xi Jinping is "deadly earnest on becoming the most significant, consequential nation in the world," Biden said in unscripted remarks as part of his first speech to a joint session of Congress. Biden said that Xi "and other autocrats think that democracy can't compete in the 21st century with autocracies, because it takes too long to get consensus."	BEIJING — U.S. President Joe Biden called for America to work together against competition from China, as tensions between the two nations simmer. Chinese President Xi Jinping is "deadly earnest on becoming the most significant, consequential nation in the world," Biden said in off-the-cuff remarks as part of his first speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night in Washington . He cited more than 24 hours of private conversation and travel with Xi, whom Biden met as vice president during the Obama administration. Biden said that Xi "and other autocrats think that democracy can't compete in the 21st century with autocracies, because it takes too long to get consensus." Taking a tough stance on China, rather than engagement, has become one point of agreement between Democrats and Republicans in an increasingly politically divided country. Tensions between the U.S. and China escalated under former President Donald Trump, who used tariffs and sanctions to try to address longstanding complaints about China's unfair practices. These included requiring companies to transfer technology in order to do business locally. While Biden has sought to work more with traditional U.S. allies in putting pressure on China, he has stuck to Trump's firm position on Beijing, including retaining tariffs and sanctions. "We are in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century," Biden said. "We are at a great inflection point in history. We have to do more than just build back better. … We have to compete more strenuously." He talked about how, in a time of rapid technological advancement, U.S. spending on research and development has dropped, and how China and other countries are "closing in fast." "We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future ," Biden said, naming electric car batteries, biotechnology, computer chips and clean energy. He also emphasized these policies would create more jobs in the U.S.: "There's simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can't be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason. None." However, Biden said competition with China — or a strong U.S. military presence in the Indo-Pacific — does not mean the U.S. is looking for conflict. Xi was the first foreign national leader to speak last week at a U.S.-led climate summit. "There is a greater possibility under Biden than under Trump that the desire to 'work with' China to fight climate change derails other policies that push back against Beijing," said Isaac Stone Fish, founder of Strategy Risks, a New York-based firm which examines businesses' exposure to China. But he expects the overall relationship between the two countries will remain tense, and noted that companies and investors, not politics, have played a greater role in moving U.S. manufacturing jobs to China.
The auto industry generally expects the chip shortage will reach a turning point in the third quarter, Nio Chairman William Li said on an earnings call Friday. For now, the start-up forecast second-quarter deliveries will grow mildly by 5% to 10% from the first three months of the year. Vehicle margin, a measure of profitability, rose to 21.2% in the first quarter, due mostly to consumers buying Nio's driving assistance software and upgrading to a more expensive battery subscription plan, management said.	BEIJING — Chinese electric car start-up Nio said Friday it expects a global chip shortage will drag down vehicle deliveries in the second quarter. A fire in March at a Japanese chip factory owned by Renesas has exacerbated an existing shortfall in semiconductors that has forced major automakers to cut production. Without naming the factory, Nio's Chairman William Li said during an earnings conference call he expects the negative impact of the fire to hit the auto supply chain in mid-May. The industry generally expects the shortage will reach a turning point in the third quarter, Li said. For now, Nio had to halt production for five working days around the end of March, which will affect vehicle deliveries for April, Li said. The start-up forecast second-quarter deliveries of between 21,000 and 22,000 vehicles, for growth of 5% to 10% from the first three months of the year. That's a significant quarter-on-quarter slowdown from growth of 16% in the first quarter, and 42% in the fourth quarter. Despite challenges from the supply chain and technological development, Li said the company's first sedan, the ET7 , remains on track for its scheduled launch to customers in the first quarter of 2022. Nio delivered 20,060 vehicles in the first quarter , the most among its U.S.-listed electric car start-up peers in China. On Friday, Nio said vehicle sales for the period were 7.41 billion yuan ($1.13 billion). However, Elon Musk's Tesla has been steadily ramping up production in China, which brought in sales of $3 billion in the first quarter for the automaker . China's share of Tesla's global sales rose to 29% in the first three months of this year, up from 21% for all of 2020 . Tesla shares are down 4% so far this year. Nio's have declined 20%. Founded in 2014, Nio reported a smaller-than-expected loss per share in the first quarter of 0.23 yuan (4 cents) versus FactSet estimates of a 0.68 yuan loss a share. Vehicle margin, a measure of profitability, rose to 21.2% in the first quarter, up from 17.2% the prior quarter. The increase was due mostly to consumers buying Nio's driving assistance software and upgrading to a more expensive battery subscription plan, management said. The 100 kilowatt-hour battery power plan costs 1,480 yuan ($228) a month, versus 980 yuan for the 70 kilowatt-hour plan. Nearly 60% of all Nio users have chosen the battery-as-a-service plan since its launch in August , company president Lihong Qin told CNBC on the sidelines of the Shanghai auto show last week. Nio has also chosen a location in Oslo, Norway, for its first venture overseas, management said Friday. The start-up plans to release more details on May 6.
China is ready to push back against real and imagined slights from the United States and its allies, even as they escalate warnings and military activities around Taiwan. Between the lines, Chinese President Xi Jinping is saying that human rights violations and democratic failings are internal matters beyond debate. Going beyond that, Chinese officials are ready to publicly attack the U.S. record on racism and democracy, as did Beijing's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in an unprecedented 16-minute diatribe. Beijing is wagering that President Biden's bark will be worse than his bite. If convinced of that, count on even more Chinese bravado and assertiveness over the next four years.	Top U.S. government officials are studying China's increased diplomatic bravado and growing military assertiveness with all the intensity of elite athletes poring over game films of their most resourceful rival. From the CIA to the White House, and from the Pentagon to Foggy Bottom, what these officials are reporting is a far greater willingness by China to go on the offensive in the first 100 days of the Biden administration. The Chinese are readier to push back against real and imagined slights from the United States and its allies, even as they escalate warnings and military activities around Taiwan. The new messaging from Beijing has been consistent: the Biden administration, in trying to undermine China's rise, is promoting a false and dangerous narrative of competition between democratic and autocratic systems. Thus, countries around the world must decide whether to follow the divisive but declining United States or embrace a rising, unifying, and nonjudgmental China. Between the lines, Chinese President Xi Jinping is saying that human rights violations and democratic failings are internal matters beyond debate. Going beyond that, Chinese officials are ready to publicly attack the U.S. record on racism and democracy, as did Beijing's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in an unprecedented 16-minute diatribe to open the first high-level U.S.-Chinese talks of the Biden administration on March 18 in Anchorage, Alaska. "Recently, there has been this tendency to compare China and the United States to 'democracy versus authoritarianism,' seek(ing) to …  pin labels on countries," said Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, building on the Alaska message last week at the Council on Foreign Relations. "But democracy is not Coca-Cola which, with the syrup produced by the United States, tastes the same across the world." Said Wang, "using democracy and human rights to conduct value-oriented diplomacy, meddle in other countries' internal affairs or stoke confrontation will only lead to turmoil or even disaster." His use of the term "disaster" caught his listeners' attention, and he made clear what he meant by that. "The Taiwan question is the most important and sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations," he said, arguing that it should also be in the U.S. interest to oppose Taiwan independence and separatist instincts. "Playing the 'Taiwan card' is a dangerous move, like playing with fire." Such rhetorical and potentially strategic shifts do not happen by accident in (yes) authoritarian China. So, it's both urgent and necessary to understand their meaning and respond appropriately. That will not be easy, given the contradictory mix of hubris and insecurity in the latest Chinese moves and measures. On the one hand, President Xi Jinping is projecting a growing national confidence that this is China's historic moment. Xi hopes to build on what he sees as game-changing momentum in this centennial anniversary year of the Chinese Communist Party, having emerged from the pandemic and having declared the end of absolute poverty in the country. At the same time, Xi is responding to new challenges from the Biden administration, which itself is escaping rapidly from Covid-19 through impressive vaccine distribution and by pumping $4 trillion and counting of stimulus and infrastructure development into the economy. U.S. growth could match or be greater than that of China this year at a remarkable 6.5% . Where the two countries' leaders appear to agree is on the fact that "we are at an inflection point in history," as President Biden told a joint session of Congress this week. "We're in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21 st century." President Xi framed it differently earlier this year, speaking to a Communist Party school session: "The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, but time and the situation are in our favor. This is where our determination and confidence are coming from." In Biden, however, Xi sees a more methodical and coherent leader than was his predecessor, one more willing to work within institutions and alongside allies. Biden on March 12 convened the first leader-level summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, bringing together Japanese, Australian, and Indian leaders. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga then on April 16 was the first foreign leader to visit the White House since Biden took office, and the two leaders issued the first joint statement in support of Taiwan since 1969. Chinese leaders also were caught off guard on March 22 when the United States, the European Union, Britain, and Canada imposed sanctions on Chinese officials for human rights abuses against the Uighur minority in Xinjiang. Beijing's response was immediate, and seemingly counterproductive, slapping punitive measures against EU individuals that were broader. The price of its tough message is that the European Parliament has put on ice the recently announced Chinese-EU investment agreement. There seem to be three immediate targets for China's current approach: the domestic audience, U.S. partners and allies, and the developing world. Any authoritarian leader's priority is political survival. President Xi's appears to have strengthened his hand within the Chinese Community Party, and weakened potential rivals, through nationalist rallying around Hong Kong and Taiwan and through portraying the United States as a power determined to reverse China's rise. The second target for Chinese bravado is a pre-emptive effort to reach U.S. allies and partners before the Biden administration has had sufficient time to galvanize greater common cause. Wherever necessary, it wants to demonstrate there will be a steep price for those who embrace Washington at Beijing's expense. One U.S. official quotes a Chinese saying to explain this strategy: "kill a chicken to scare the monkey." President Xi's third target is the developing world, where Chinese inroads have been greatest. The aim here is to portray China as a more reliable and consistent partner for their development, with its own inspiring track record of modernization and commitment to stay out of other countries' internal affairs (and, indeed, supply fellow authoritarians with the surveillance tools to remain in power). At the same time, of course, China is also testing the Biden administration. The aim is not to win over Washington, where the consensus about the Chinese challenge has been growing. Rather, it is to test the willingness of the Biden administration to act on any number of issues—ranging from technology controls to human rights—but most significantly regarding Taiwan. Beijing is wagering, from previous experience, that President Biden's bark will be worse than his bite. If convinced of that, count on even more Chinese bravado and assertiveness over the next four years.

Fifteen regions in the northern half of China, including Beijing and Inner Mongolia, accounted for 63.4% of the number of national bond defaults last year, up from 51.5% in 2019, according to Nomura's estimates published in an April 27 report. "The new environmental campaign has the potential to hit North China — where a majority of steel, aluminum, and other raw materials are produced and processed — especially hard," the Nomura analysts wrote. "The north/south divide could become an important factor for credit differentiation in the years ahead," the report said.	BEIJING — China's bond defaults are increasingly concentrated in a part of the country whose growth could face greater pressure from tough new restrictions on carbon emissions, according to analysis from Nomura. Fifteen regions in the northern half of China, including Beijing and Inner Mongolia, accounted for 63.4% of the number of national bond defaults last year, up from 51.5% in 2019, according to Nomura's estimates published in an April 27 report. It's the latest sign of growing economic disparity within the country, where GDP and population growth in the north already lags that of the south. Now, China's pledge to to reduce carbon emissions by 2030 means production restrictions are coming for the northern region's economy. "The new environmental campaign has the potential to hit North China — where a majority of steel, aluminum, and other raw materials are produced and processed — especially hard," the Nomura analysts wrote. "Since most of those steel and aluminum plants are in low-tier (less developed) cities, the public financials of these cities will likely be disproportionately impacted, adding to credit default risks," they said. North China is home to many state-owned enterprises and heavy industries. That meant the region was disproportionately affected beginning in the late 1980s, when China began to reduce the role of state-owned enterprises in the economy , causing many workers to lose their jobs. Meanwhile, South China has more export hubs like the provinces of Guangdong and Jiangsu. The region counts Shanghai and Shenzhen among its major cities, and was an early beneficiary of China's move to allow more foreign and privately-run businesses into the relatively closed domestic market. Historical factors, as well as overcapacity built up following the 2008 financial crisis, have contributed to further weakness in the north, the Nomura analysts said. They estimate North China contributed to just 35.2% of national nominal GDP last year, with per capita GDP just about three-fourths of that in South China. The north also relies more on debt. Outstanding corporate bonds as a percentage of GDP in North China rose to 52% in 2020, versus 30% for South China, according to Nomura. "The north/south divide could become an important factor for credit differentiation in the years ahead," the report said. "Indeed, we have already observed some deterioration in the capacity of the North China provinces to obtain funding from bond markets." The north accounted for 10% of national corporate bond issuance in the first quarter, down from 42% for all of last year, the analysts said. Increased pressure on the north comes as defaults are ticking up in China overall, particularly among state-owned enterprises that investors used to assume had implicit government support. While the level of defaults is still quite low relative to the overall market, the trend will prompt investors to differentiate among different bond issuers, said Ivan Chung, head of Moody's greater China credit research and analysis team. Chung said issuers have canceled bond issuance in the last month or so for two different reasons. One is that the issuer was too weak to attract enough investor appetite, he said. The other is that, despite good quality, the market sentiment has driven up the cost of the bonds, making them too expensive. In some signs of growing concern, in April investors worried that state-owned bad debt manager Huarong would not be able to make its payments. Separately, 24 companies backed by the provincial government of Henan plan to set up a 30 billion yuan ($4.6 billion) fund to support local businesses in the event of debt risks, Chinese financial media site Caixin reported , citing a government official. Henan is part of Nomura's designation of "North China." As China looks to balance growth with reducing carbon emissions , tapering pressure on carbon-heavy projects may not be enough. Privately-run businesses in renewable energy can find it difficult to get financing from a system in which the largest banks are state-owned and prefer to lend to similarly state-backed enterprises. One option for financing renewable energy projects can be issuing "green" bonds, of which $15.7 billion dollars' worth was sold in China in the first quarter, according to Reuters, citing data from Refinitiv. That volume was almost four times what it was a year ago, the report said. Foreign investment bodies like the World Bank Group-affiliated International Finance Corporation have gotten increasingly involved as well. Some of the project plans IFC lists on its website for China include wastewater treatment and solar power. The scale of IFC's financing in China has grown from $500 million annually 15 years ago, to $1 billion a year more recently, with about 60% related to climate, said Randall Riopelle, acting regional director for East Asia and the Pacific and country manager for China for IFC.

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wang Wenbin in a Tuesday statement urged the Philippines for "basic manners" and cautioned against "megaphone diplomacy." Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Teodoro Locsin Jr. tweeted that China should "get the f--- out" as the two countries engaged in a war of words over the South China Sea. In several tweets since, Locsin apologized to Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and said he was "provoked by the latest grossest territorial violation."	China called for "basic manners" and cautioned against "megaphone diplomacy" after Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Teodoro Locsin Jr. lashed out at Beijing in an offensive tweet . On Monday, Locsin told China in a tweet to "get the f--- out" as the two countries engaged in a war of words over the South China Sea. The secretary has been a vocal China critic in President Rodrigo Duterte's government and is known for his occasional blunt remarks. In several tweets over the subsequent days, Locsin apologized to Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and said he was "provoked by the latest grossest territorial violation." Meanwhile, Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque reportedly said the Philippine president has reminded officials that profanity has no place in diplomacy . Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wang Wenbin responded to Locsin's outburst in a Tuesday statement , saying that "facts have proven time and time again that megaphone diplomacy can only undermine mutual trust rather than change reality." But Beijing also has a track record of firing insults at other countries. Such aggressive tactics by Chinese diplomats have in recent years increasingly played out on social media platforms such as Twitter, which is blocked on the mainland. Observers dubbed those tactics "wolf warrior diplomacy," taking after a series of hugely popular movies where Chinese fighters defeat adversaries globally. China and the Philippines have for years contested overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea, a resource-rich waterway with a total area of about 1.4 million square miles where trillions in dollars of global trade pass. Beijing has in the past year appeared more assertive in the disputed waters , leading Manila to protest on several occasions the presence of Chinese vessels in parts of the sea that are internationally recognized as belonging to the Philippines. Beijing on Tuesday reiterated that Bajo de Masinloc — which it calls Huangyan Island — and its surrounding waters fall under China's jurisdiction. Bajo de Masinloc, also known as Scarborough Shoal, is a chain of reefs in the South China Sea that lies around 120 nautical miles from the nearest Philippine coast and 470 nautical miles from the nearest coast of China. China claims most of the South China Sea, based on what it says are nine dashes that delineate Chinese territory in historic maps. An international tribunal in 2016 dismissed the so-called nine-dash line as legally baseless — a ruling ignored by Beijing.
Bookings during the May 1 to 5 holiday more than tripled from the same period a year ago, with Shanghai Disney Resort among the top 10 destinations, according to Chinese travel booking site Trip.com. China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism said a record 230 million trips were taken in the country during the holiday, while total spending of 113.23 billion yuan ($17.48 billion) fell short of 2019 levels. The surge in domestic bookings comes as the coronavirus pandemic keeps Chinese from venturing overseas.	BEIJING — Millions of Chinese rushed to travel during the five-day Labor Day holiday, in yet another sign of gradual recovery in domestic consumption. May 1 to 5 marked the "hottest" public holiday for leisure travel since the coronavirus pandemic, Chinese travel booking site Trip.com said in a statement Wednesday translated by CNBC. The reemergence of Covid-19 on the outskirts of Beijing earlier this year prompted local authorities to restrict travel during the Spring Festival in February. Labor Day holiday bookings for hotels, car rentals and other travel more than tripled from the same period a year ago, and rose more than 30% from 2019, Trip.com said, without disclosing dollar amounts. Shanghai Disney Resort was among the top 10 destinations, including for those 21 years old and younger, according to Trip.com. Chinese consumers also spent 1.67 billion yuan ($260 million) at the movies during the holiday, primarily on domestic films, according to ticketing site Maoyan. Overall, a record 230 million trips were taken within the country during that period, an increase of nearly 18% from 2019 levels, according to figures from China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism. However, total spending of 113.23 billion yuan ($17.48 billion) fell short of 2019's expenditure by about 4 billion yuan, the data showed. At that level, spending per capita during the holiday was about 75% of what it was in 2019, said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. "Overall the economic trend continues to improve, but part of the service sector (is) not yet back to the pre-Covid level." Spending by individual consumers has lagged the recovery in China's economy since Covid-19 temporarily forced more than half the country to shut down in early 2020. Retail sales fell last year despite overall GDP growth, before surging in the first quarter of 2021. The rush to travel domestically comes as quarantine requirements and travel bans keep most Chinese from venturing overseas. Chinese international travel plunged 87% last year and will not likely return to pre-pandemic levels until the second quarter of 2023, consultancy Oliver Wyman said in a report last week. That means billions of dollars not spent overseas can potentially be spent at home or saved for future purchases, the report said, pointing out that Chinese consumers spent $245 billion abroad in 2019. The analysis found that nearly 60% of those travelers are turning to the southern tropical island province of Hainan, which has expanded its duty-free shopping centers in the last few years. Duty-free sales in Hainan topped 700 million yuan from May 1 to 4, according to state media, citing the latest available figures from the local customs agency. For comparison, an eight-day holiday in October recorded 1.04 billion yuan in Hainan's duty-free sales. "May is seen as the first (moment when) you can really see the true potential of Hainan, without any travel restrictions," Oliver Wyman partner Imke Wouters said in a phone interview Thursday. However, she pointed out that right now brands need to work with duty-free centers in Hainan. As a result, profitability could be up to 50% less than it would be through their own stores on the mainland. "For high-end luxury brands, Hainan will become much more attractive to them if in the future they can open their own stores instead of through a duty-free operator," Wouters said, noting government policy is moving toward individual store ownership.
Chinese electric car start-up Nio announced it plans to begin deliveries in Norway in September, for the company's first entry into a market outside China. More than half of new cars sold in Norway last year were battery-powered electric vehicles, according to the Norwegian Road Federation. Another Chinese electric car start-up, Xpeng, delivered 100 units of its G3 electric SUV in December.	BEIJING — Chinese electric car start-up Nio announced Thursday it plans to begin deliveries in Norway in September, for the company's first entry into a market outside China. Nio plans to first launch its ES8 SUV to the new market this year, followed by its ET7 sedan in 2022. The company anticipates expanding its local staff of 15 people to 50 by the end of the year. The Norway venture will begin with a flagship "Nio House" store in Oslo that's slated to open in the third quarter. Four smaller showrooms are set to open in other parts of Norway next year. More than half the new cars sold in Norway last year were battery-powered electric vehicles, according to the Norwegian Road Federation. The 54.3% proportion marked a rapid increase from 42% the prior year. Electric vehicles have dominated new passenger car sales in Norway for the last three years, with Volkswagen 's Audi e-tron leading last year, Tesla 's Model 3 in 2019 and Nissan 's Leaf in 2018, according to the federation. Other Chinese electric car makers are already selling to Norway. U.S.-listed Xpeng delivered 100 units of its G3 electric SUV in December. Later this year, Xpeng hopes to see how customers in northern Europe respond to its P7 electric sedan, Chairman and CEO He Xiaopeng said on the sidelines of the the Shanghai auto show last month. He is recruiting new staff and plans to set up a company in the region, before looking at western and eastern Europe.
U.S. dollar-denominated exports rose 32.3% in April from a year ago, China's customs agency said Friday. That beat an estimate of 24.1% growth from analysts polled by Reuters. Imports rose 43.1% in U.S. dollar terms, also topping expectations of 42.5% growth, based on a Reuters poll. Exports were boosted by demand for electronics and high-tech products, while China bought more integrated circuits amid U.S. sanctions and a global chip shortage.	BEIJING — China's exports surged more than expected in April as global demand for Chinese goods remained elevated amid countries' varying stages of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. dollar-denominated exports rose 32.3% in April from a year ago, China's customs agency said Friday. That beat an estimate of 24.1% growth from analysts polled by Reuters. Imports rose 43.1% in U.S. dollar terms, also topping expectations of 42.5% growth, based on a Reuters poll. Exports were boosted by demand for electronics and high-tech products, while China bought more integrated circuits amid U.S. sanctions and a global chip shortage. "The outlook for Chinese exports is positive," Joseph Capurso, head of international economics at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a note Friday. He expects that Europe and Japan will follow the U.S. economic recovery once vaccination rates pick up. Chinese trade with major partners grew despite political tensions. During U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, China and the U.S. levied tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods. Tensions between China and Australia took a turn for the worse Thursday after Beijing suspended a high-level economic dialogue between the two countries. In April, exports to the U.S. rose 31% from a year ago to $42.05 billion. Imports from the U.S. rose 52% to $13.94 billion. Capurso attributed improvement in U.S.-China trade to large U.S. fiscal stimulus under President Joe Biden. "The recovery in US‑China trade has reversed much of the trade war slump, even though few restrictions on trade have been removed," he said. He noted that China has also bought Australian products despite restrictions, mostly on farm goods. "While product details are not available, we speculate the surge in commodity prices is behind both the expansion in China's imports from Australia and China trade deficit with Australia," Capurso said. Chinese imports from Australia rose 49% in April to $14.87 billion, while exports rose 20% to $5.25 billion. Exports to the EU rose 24% to $39.92 billion, while imports climbed 43% to $26.79 billion.
Relations between China and Australia are unlikely to get back on track anytime soon after Beijing on Thursday moved to  "indefinitely" suspend all high-level economic dialogue with Canberra, according to a political expert. James Laurenceson, director of the Australia-China relations institute at the University of Technology Sydney, called China's decision to halt all activities under the framework of the  China-Australia Strategic Economic Dialogue, as more than just a symbolic move.	China-Australia ties won't be getting back on track anytime soon — after Beijing's decision to to indefinitely suspend high-level economic talks with Canberra, according to one political expert. James Laurenceson, director of the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney, described the strained relations between Canberra and Beijing as "complicated." "I see no prospects on the horizon for this relationship to get back on track," he told CNBC on Friday, adding both sides are blaming each other for the breakdown in dialogue. The National Development and Reform Commission, China's economic planning agency, announced Thursday that it will "indefinitely suspend all activities under the framework of the China-Australia Strategic Economic Dialogue." The move comes after some officials in Australia launched unspecified measures "out of a Cold War mindset" to disrupt cooperation with China, the NDRC statement said . China's decision to halt all activities under the framework is more than just a symbolic move, said Laurenceson. "I think saying it's just symbolism and it doesn't amount to anything meaningful is wrong. Symbolism matters in international relations — particularly when it's on the negative side," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Friday. He called Beijing's latest move a "tit-for-tat" retaliation to show its displeasure after Australia scrapped two Belt and Road deals last month. "We know tit-for-tat is baked in China's foreign policy moves, so after Canberra tore up that agreement a couple of weeks ago, there was always the prospect," he said. Australian Minister for Trade Tourism and Investment Dan Tehan on Thursday expressed his disappointment at the suspension of talks. "The Strategic Economic Dialogue, which was last held in 2017, is an important forum for Australia and China to work through issues relevant to our economic partnership," he said in a statement. "We remain open to holding the dialogue and engaging at the ministerial level." Relations between the two countries have been strained since Australia blocked Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei from its 5G network in 2018. It worsened last year when Canberra called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak, triggering trade sanctions from Beijing on Australian wine, coal and barley in retaliation. "At the moment, what we're seeing is a doubling down on hardening stances in Beijing (and) in Canberra," Laurenceson told CNBC. "In Australia, at the moment, there is no domestic political pressure for the Morrison government to change tack. In fact, public support in Australia has rallied around him."
In the last year, the People's Bank of China has distributed several million dollars' worth of a digital yuan through an app that is connected with the six major, state-owned banks. MYbank, an online-only bank in which Ant has a 30% stake, is now allowing some users to link their accounts with China's digital currency app, state-backed China Securities Journal said Monday. Ant did not confirm the exact nature of its participation in the digital currency project, but said that along with MYbank, the group would be involved with trials and research around the digital yuan.	BEIJING — Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba , is becoming one of the first major privately run businesses to work with China's digital currency trials. MYbank — an online-only bank in which Ant has a 30% stake — is allowing some users to link their accounts with China's digital yuan app, state-backed China Securities Journal said Monday . The new feature is accessible to some users through Ant's Alipay app, another report from the journal said . Alipay is one of the two primary mobile pay apps in China, where using smartphones for daily payment transactions is the norm. In the last year, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has distributed several million dollars' worth of a digital yuan through an app that is connected with the six major, state-owned banks. These tests have allowed selected users to buy products from participating brick-and-mortar stores and JD.com 's e-commerce app. Ant did not confirm the exact nature of its participation in the digital currency project, but said that along with MYbank, the group would be involved with trials and research around the digital yuan — also called e-CNY — according to a statement. "As one of the participants in the trial of the e-CNY, Ant Group's associate MYbank will steadily advance the trial pursuant to the overall arrangement of the People's Bank of China," the company said. "Ant Group, together with MYbank, will also continue to support the research, development and trial of PBOC's e-CNY." MYbank said it had more than 35 million small business and individual clients as of the end of last year, marking growth of 68% from the year before. It was not immediately clear to what extent MYbank users could transact in the digital yuan. The news comes as Chinese authorities seek to encourage spending through shopping festivals this month in Shanghai and other cities, where state media said some merchants are accepting the digital yuan. Reuters reported in late February that MYbank and WeBank, an internet bank backed by Tencent , were joining the central bank's digital currency pilot. Chinese media noted on Monday that WeBank accounts were not yet activated for use with the digital yuan app. A representative for WeBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ant's increased involvement with the digital yuan comes despite increased scrutiny from Chinese regulators. Authorities abruptly suspended Ant's massive IPO in November and last month, regulators said Ant would restructure as a financial holding company. Unlike internationally popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin , China's digital currency is controlled by a single authority — the central bank.
The average annual growth rate was 0.53% over the past 10 years, according to the results of the seventh national census released on Tuesday. The population survey, which was conducted late last year, was originally expected to be released in April.	BEIJING — China's once-a-decade census showed the population of the mainland was 1.41 billion people as of Nov. 1, 2020, marking the slowest growth rate since the 1950s. The average annual growth rate was 0.53% over the past 10 years, according to the results of the seventh national census, released Tuesday. That's down from an average annual growth rate of 0.57% between 2000 and 2010. Ning Jizhe, National Bureau of Statistics commissioner, attributed the decline primarily to a continued drop in the number of women of childbearing age, a delay in giving birth and rising costs of raising children. Several years ago, Chinese authorities began to roll back a decades-old "one-child policy" and allow people to have two children. But births continued to fall, dropping 15% in 2020 in a fourth straight year of decline. The population survey, which was conducted late last year, was originally expected to be released in April. In 2019, mainland China's population rose by 4.67 million to just over 1.4 billion people, according to official figures by the National Bureau of Statistics. The aging of the population has significant implications for China's economic development. The proportion of China's working age population, or those between 15 and 59 years old, fell by 6.79 percentage points in 2020 versus 2010, the data showed. In contrast, the ratio of people aged 60 and up rose by 5.44 percentage points. The rate at which China's population is aging is faster than that of southeast Asian nations, which could give those countries an opportunity to draw some labor-intensive manufacturing away from China, said Yue Su, principal economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit. But she noted that China's rate of aging is still slower than developed Asian economies such as South Korea. Su said since it takes about 15 to 20 years for policy changes to affect the labor supply, there is an urgency for authorities to relax restrictions on births. Earlier this year, researchers with the People's Bank of China published a paper calling for the full removal of restrictions on childbirth . The paper also gave other suggestions for encouraging more births, while describing how China's aging population puts the country at an economic disadvantage to the U.S. and India. The census also showed that more Chinese were moving away from the poorer northeastern part of the country, to the wealthier eastern and southern regions. In fact, three provinces in northeastern China saw their population decline in the last decade. The migrant population increased by 69.73%, or about 154 million people, the census found. However, more people chose to stay within the same province. "Overall this movement is positive to China's economy overall," Su said. "It basically reflects the resources are concentrated around cities and regions that have higher economic efficiency." The number of people living in urban areas rose to 63.89%, up from about 49% a decade earlier.
Goldman Sachs analysts have put together a basket of foreign stocks that generate about a fifth or more of their sales in China. The country's relatively early struggle with the coronavirus pandemic versus other major countries means hundreds of millions of locals are now ready to spend more.	Just-in quarterly earnings reveal how China strategies can pay off for some companies — an investment idea Goldman Sachs analysts are betting on. In portfolio strategy research published May 6, the analysts laid out stocks that generate about a fifth or more of their sales in China. The country's relatively early struggle with the coronavirus pandemic versus other major countries means hundreds of millions of locals are now ready to spend more. As the five-day Labor Day holiday this month shows, Chinese stuck within national borders didn't hold back on travel as Trip.com says bookings more than tripled from a year ago . Goldman's selection focuses on European brands, which avoid the potential overhang from Beijing's tensions with the U.S. Here are some of the analysts' top picks, broken down by industry category:
More than 40% of respondents surveyed by the American Chamber of Commerce are considering or planning to leave Hong Kong. Of those planning to leave, around 62.3% cited discomfort with the national security law as a reason, the survey showed. Those intending to remain in Hong Kong cited factors such as a good quality of life and excellent business environment.	A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong found that 42% of respondents are considering or planning to leave Hong Kong, with more than half citing their discomfort with the controversial national security law imposed by China. Various media outlets have reported anecdotes of people or businesses leaving Hong Kong following the clampdown by Beijing. And the Amcham survey offers a glimpse of the sentiment among the expatriate community in Hong Kong. Last year, China bypassed Hong Kong's legislature to impose the national security law. Implementation of the law came after widespread pro-democracy protests rocked the financial hub in 2019 and took a toll on its economy. Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The chamber collected 325 anonymous responses for the survey, or 24% of its membership, between May 5 and May 9. About 78% of respondents were expatriates who live in Hong Kong for work but do not hail from there. Among those planning to move out of the city: Around 62.3% of those considering leaving cited the national security law (NSL) as a reason. "Previously, I never had a worry about what I said or wrote when I was in Hong Kong," said an anonymous respondent to the Amcham survey. "With the NSL, that has changed. The red lines are vague and seem to be arbitrary. I don't want to continue to fear saying or writing something that could unknowingly cause me to be arrested," the person said. Hong Kong is ruled under a special framework that promises the city limited autonomy, including legislative and independent judicial power. The Hong Kong government said last year the law is aimed at "an extremely small minority of criminals who threaten national security." It maintained that the legislation "will not affect the legitimate rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents." Some critics disagreed. Former pro-democracy lawmaker Emily Lau told CNBC last month that people in Hong Kong have become "distressed" and "disillusioned" as some fear the city has lost important freedoms. Still, a slight majority of respondents — about 58% — in the Amcham survey said they're not planning to leave Hong Kong. Around 76.8% of them cited a good quality of life in the city, while some 55.1% said the business environment is excellent. "Whilst we plan to stay for now, we are not sure about the long term in light of the political changes that have been taking place recently which make HK a less attractive place to be," a respondent said.
The U.S.-based electric car company sold 27% fewer made-in-China cars in April versus March, according to figures released Tuesday by the China Passenger Car Association. Tesla's sales decline came amid an overall 12% month-on-month drop in April for new energy passenger cars in China, and increased scrutiny from regulators in the last several months on Elon Musk's automaker. The report showed Guangdong-based BYD, which is backed by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett, came close behind Tesla in terms of new energy car sales in April, which rose from March.	BEIJING — One gauge of Tesla's success in China pointed to a sharp drop in sales in April. The U.S.-based electric car company sold 25,845 made-in-China vehicles last month, down 27% from 35,478 in March, according to figures released Tuesday by the China Passenger Car Association. The report noted that in April, Tesla exported 14,174 cars from its Shanghai factory. The association did not disclose Tesla's export figures for March. Tesla's sales decline came amid an overall 12% month-on-month drop in April for new energy passenger cars in China, according to the association. The category includes pure-electric and hybrid cars. Guangdong-based BYD , which is backed by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett, came close behind Tesla in April. The passenger car association said  BYD sold 25,450 new energy vehicles in April, up 6.5% from 23,906 in March. The figures are close to those disclosed by BYD itself, which said earlier this month it sold 25,034 new energy passenger cars in April. Some in China's electric car industry have cast doubt on the accuracy of the association's figures. Tesla does not disclose monthly deliveries by country. The company delivered 184,800 cars worldwide during the first quarter. Publicly disclosed figures indicate China is becoming a more and more important market for Tesla. The company made $3 billion in sales in the country during the first quarter, accounting for 29% of global sales for the period. That's up from up from 21% for all of 2020 . Meanwhile, negative press has increased for Tesla in China. In the last few months, local reports of Tesla brake failures, crashes and explosions have mounted and drawn scrutiny from regulators. Separately on Tuesday, Reuters reported, citing sources, that Tesla has halted plans to buy land and expand its Shanghai factory . Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report, or the association's figures. Shares fell about 1.9% overnight and are down roughly 12% for the year so far. Looking ahead, the passenger car association pointed out the capital city of Beijing is releasing 60,000 new license plates for new energy vehicles this month, which should help sales for recent market launches such as Tesla's Model Y and Aion Y, produced by a new energy brand spun-off from Chinese state-owned automaker GAC.
In January, the administration under former President Donald Trump designated Xiaomi as one of several "Communist Chinese military companies" or CCMC. That restricting American investors from buying shares or related securities of any companies given this designation. On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Defense agreed to remove the designation from Xiaomi.	GUANGZHOU, China — The U.S. has agreed to remove Xiaomi from a blacklist that would have barred Americans from investing in the Chinese smartphone maker. Shares of Chinese tech giant Xiaomi rallied as much as 6.5% after the news, before paring some gains. In January, the administration under former President Donald Trump designated Xiaomi as one of several "Communist Chinese military companies " or CCMC. This meant the world's third-largest smartphone maker was subject to a November executive order restricting American investors from buying shares or related securities of any companies given this designation by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). Xiaomi brought a legal challenge against the U.S. Department of Defense. In March, a U.S. court granted Xiaomi a preliminary injunction against the Trump-era order, saying the company would "suffer irreparable harm in the form of serious reputational and unrecoverable economic injuries." And on Tuesday, the DOD agreed that a "final order vacating" Xiaomi's designation as a CCMC "would be appropriate," according to a court filing. Xiaomi and the DOD will "negotiate over the specific terms of the order" and provide the court with a "joint proposed order" on or before May 20.
Meituan has seen around $38.96 billion wiped off its value in the last few days as Beijing turns its regulatory scrutiny on the Chinese food delivery giant. Chinese opened an antitrust probe into Meituan in April not long after fining Alibaba $2.8 billion in a similar investigation. But pressure has been added to Meituan as working conditions of its drivers come under the spotlight and a poem posted by the company's CEO caused some controversy.	GUANGZHOU, China — Meituan has seen around $38.96 billion wiped off its value in the past two weeks as Beijing turns its regulatory scrutiny on the Chinese food delivery giant. On April 26, China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) opened an investigation into "suspected monopolistic practices" of Meituan. It's only the second antitrust investigation into a domestic technology firm. Alibaba was the first to fall into the crosshairs and ended up being fined 18.23 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) as a result . The market regulator is looking at an alleged practice where Meituan forces merchants to choose its platform over rivals or face penalties for listing on both. Since closing at 305 Hong Kong dollars on April 26, Meituan shares have plunged about 16%. On Wednesday, the stock gained about 2.5% closing at 255.20 Hong Kong dollars, breaking 10 days of selling. Still, since April 26, around $38.96 billion of value has been wiped off the company. The Meituan probe highlights a broadening drive to regulate China's technology sector which has largely grown unencumbered over the past few years. In February, China issued revised antitrust rules for so-called "platform economy" companies, which is a broad-brush term for internet firms operating a variety of services from e-commerce to food delivery. In response to the SAMR probe, Meituan said it will "actively cooperate with the regulators on the investigation, take steps to improve its businesses' compliance management, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of its users and all relevant parties, promote the healthy and long-term development of the industry, and strive to fulfill its social responsibilities." While the SAMR investigation — which could result in a multi-billion yuan fine — is certainly the most serious issue for Meituan, a number of incidents since then have piled more pressure on the delivery giant. Last month, Wang Lin, an official at the Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, went undercover as a Meituan driver, earning 41 yuan ($6.37) during a 12 hour shift. He was exploring the working conditions of Meituan drivers. Meituan said it has held 22 meetings with delivery workers to learn about their ideas to improve their working process. The company said it has initiated plans in terms of drivers' career development and protection of their rights and interests. "We know this is far from enough, but we will keep working to improve delivery workers' working experience," Meituan said in a statement in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. Further scrutiny on the company was spurred by an unlikely source — a poem posted online by Meituan CEO Wang Xing on May 6. He founded China's first Twitter-like service called Fanfou in the late 2000s. While Weibo is the most dominant microblogging platform in China now, Fanfou still has a niche audience. And Wang has a devoted following on the service where he posts several times a day. The poem told a story of an ancient emperor who burned books to silence intellectuals. But he was eventually overthrown by two uneducated people. It was interpreted as a veiled criticism of Xi Jinping's government. Wang deleted the post and issued a clarification on May 9. He noted the emperor was overthrown by two people who didn't have much of an education and used it to express a business lesson. "This reminds me that the most dangerous rivals are usually not those you expect. Alibaba has been watching JD.com for a long time. In the end, it was Pinduoduo who came from nowhere and competed with Taobao," Wang said in Mandarin, according to a CNBC translation. Taobao is one of the e-commerce products owned by Alibaba. Pinduoduo is a fast-growing rival. "Similarly, it looks like Ele.me is Meituan's biggest rival. But what could overthrow food delivery business could probably be companies or business models that we haven't paid attention to," he added. Ele.me is Alibaba's food delivery app. The latest bit of pressure on Meituan came from the Shanghai Consumer Council, a consumer rights group. On Monday, it criticized Meituan for some of its business practices around fees it charges to merchants among other complaints. The Shanghai Consumer Council is not a regulator. Meituan declined to comment on the poem and the Shanghai Consumer Council's post when contacted by CNBC. — CNBC's Iris Wang contributed to this report.
China's once-a-decade census released on Tuesday showed the population of the mainland grew to 1.41 billion people as of Nov. 1, 2020. That was the slowest growth rate since the 1950s. "The trend of the old age dependency is going to rise … This is a warning not only for China, but also across the whole world, as China is the core of the supply chain," Raymond Yeung, Greater China chief economist at ANZ, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia." He added that another possible impact would be on the world's financial markets, as China's high savings rate has been supporting global markets.	SINGAPORE — An ANZ economist warned on Wednesday that China's aging population will have a big impact on the world as the global supply chain is highly reliant on the world's second-largest economy. China's once-a-decade census released on Tuesday showed the population of the mainland grew to 1.41 billion people as of Nov. 1, 2020. That was the slowest growth rate since the 1950s. "The trend of the old age dependency is going to rise … This is a warning not only for China, but also across the whole world, as China is the core of the supply chain," Raymond Yeung, Greater China chief economist at ANZ, told CNBC's " Squawk Box Asia ." "Over the next few years, China will be losing 70 million (of its) workforce … so this is a big shock to the global supply chain." He added that another possible impact would be on financial markets, as China's high savings rate has been supporting global markets. China has one of the world's highest savings rates among individuals, and many retail investors are investing their extra cash, or the money is being held in pension funds. The census also showed that births continued to fall, dropping 15% in 2020 — a fourth straight year of decline. Experts have said that China's aging problem goes beyond its one-child policy and that other changes are needed to boost growth as births fall and its population ages. Similar to other major economies, high housing and educational costs in China have deterred people from having children in recent years. Yeung told CNBC that the country needs to boost its labor productivity instead. He said that the country's falling birth rate is unlikely to reverse, even if it relaxes its one-child policy. "More importantly, China (should) continue to sustain growth through technological development, go for high tech, go for high value-add, go for transformation of the whole supply chain, in order to support the economic growth on a sustainable basis," he said, adding that this is a "more realistic" approach than focusing on its population numbers. China's economy has relied heavily on industries such as manufacturing that require large amounts of cheap labor. But rising wages are making Chinese factories less attractive, while workers will need higher skills to help the country become more innovative. "I think this is a very pressing issue, that China really needs to tame this grey rhino, as everybody knows the problem is there, everybody knows they need to do something," he said. The term "grey rhino" refers to highly obvious, yet ignored threats. — CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.
The challenges to market access remain despite increased pressure on Beijing under the administration of former President Donald Trump. Industries in which U.S. companies operate at a disadvantage in China include health care, movies and cloud computing, the American Chamber of Commerce in China said Tuesday. "AmCham China's members face longstanding structural challenges in the China market that conspire to tilt the playing field against (foreign-invested enterprises) and foreign investors," the report said. However, members of the business organization did say China is improving its protection of intellectual property rights.	BEIJING — Many U.S. companies in China are still finding it harder to operate in the country compared with their Chinese counterparts in the U.S., the American Chamber of Commerce in China said in a report released Tuesday. "AmCham China's members face longstanding structural challenges in the China market that conspire to tilt the playing field against (foreign-invested enterprises) and foreign investors," the report said. "Two-thirds of members say they would consider increasing their investments in China if markets were open on a par with those in the US, a slight increase on last year," the authors wrote. Foreign businesses in China must often work with a local partner and face many limits on local investment, while Chinese companies can operate in the U.S. with far fewer restrictions. The market access challenges remain despite increased pressure on Beijing under former President Donald Trump's administration. Trump used tariffs and sanctions to address long-standing complaints about China's business practices — including lack of intellectual property protection and requiring companies to transfer technology. The following are some industries in which American companies operate at a disadvantage in China, according to the report: The central Chinese government has taken steps in the last few years to improve the operating environment for foreign businesses. A new foreign investment law took effect last year, while Beijing has peeled back ownership restrictions in finance and other industries. "Chinese courts have improved in terms of disputes in intellectual property rights," AmCham Policy Committee Head Lester Ross told reporters in a call Tuesday. Citing his perspective as a lawyer, he said that "China's courts have become somewhat fairer." AmCham also found that over the past year, 47% of its members said enforcement of intellectual property rights has improved overall. However, political tensions between the U.S. and China have become the primary challenge for AmCham members operating in the Asian country, the report said. On the call with reporters Tuesday, Chairman Greg Gilligan said the political environment has made it even harder for central government policies supporting foreign business to be implemented at a city level. "We feel that local officials are reacting to the level of tensions in the relationship, and just taking the safer path, which is to offer preference to domestic industry," he said. Gilligan expects tensions between the two countries to persist for at least the next two years, due to domestic politics that require each leader to maintain a firm stance on the other country. Since taking office in January, U.S. President Joe Biden has kept Trump-era tariffs and sanctions in place, while seeking to work with traditional U.S. allies in putting pressure on China. As the world's second-largest economy, China is a "priority market" for more than two-thirds of AmCham's members, the report said. The business organization said its surveys indicate nearly 85% of members are not planning to move manufacturing or sourcing away from China in the near term.
Index giant MSCI announced Wednesday that effective after the close on May 27, its global indexes will track the Chinese e-commerce company's shares listed in Hong Kong, rather than New York. These indexes include the benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index that many institutional investors use to determine how they should invest outside of the U.S., Europe and Japan. A representative for Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	BEIJING — Stock index giant MSCI said Wednesday it is removing the U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba from its global indexes, and replacing them with Alibaba's Hong Kong-traded shares . The move, set to take effect after the close on May 27, could see trillions of U.S. dollars tracking those indexes leave the U.S. Trading volume for Alibaba's Hong Kong shares, which is a fraction of those listed in the New York, could also surge. The affected indexes include the benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index that many institutional investors use to determine how they should invest outside of the U.S., Europe and Japan. A representative for Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When the tech giant founded by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma listed in New York in 2014, it marked the biggest initial public offering at that time. Chinese start-ups have since rushed to list in the U.S. despite political tensions. But as concerns about potential de-listing of Chinese stocks from U.S. exchanges grow, major companies like Alibaba and JD.com have launched dual listings in Hong Kong in the last two years.
"What we've seen is that this tight situation will continue for the next quarter or so," said Brian Gu, vice chairman and president of Xpeng. Xpeng's U.S.-listed shares fell nearly 4.9% in Thursday's trading session despite the start-up reporting greater-than-expected revenue in the first quarter. The company noted first-quarter results were helped by customer demand for its assisted driving software.	BEIJING — Chinese electric car start-up Xpeng expects the global chip shortage will persist for at least another three months. Automakers around the world have had to cut production due to a shortfall in semiconductors, or chips . High demand for electronics, U.S.-China trade tensions and a major factory fire have affected the highly specialized industry's ability to manufacture enough chips. "What we've seen is that this tight situation will continue for the next quarter or so," Brian Gu, vice chairman and president of Xpeng, said Friday on CNBC's " Squawk Box Asia ." The challenge is "the visibility of chip supplies is by the minute," Gu said. "We are paying very, very close attention to the situation. Right now, the impact is limited and it's reflected in our guidance." Xpeng's U.S.-listed shares fell nearly 4.9% in Thursday's trading session despite the start-up reporting greater-than-expected revenue of 2.95 billion yuan ($456.7 million) for the first quarter. The stock is now down nearly 45% for the year so far, but still holds gains of more than 50% from its IPO in August. Xpeng expects to deliver between 15,500 and 16,000 vehicles in the second quarter. The company said it delivered 13,340 cars in the first three months of the year, topping its forecast for 12,500 cars. While car sales account for the majority of Xpeng's revenue, the company noted first-quarter results were helped by customer demand for its assisted driving software. The start-up said it recorded revenue from the software for the first time after a rollout of an upgrade to paying customers in the first quarter. Gu said on CNBC that more than 25% of customers have paid for the assisted driving software in the last month, up from 20% last quarter. He expects greater use of Xpeng's software and lower vehicle production costs will increase the company's margin in the near future. Later this year, Xpeng plans to launch a second electric sedan, the P5, which includes support for the latest version of the start-up's assisted driving software. Vehicle margin, a measure of profitability, rose to 10.1% in the first quarter, up from 6.8% in the prior quarter. The company did report a year-on-year increase in net losses, of 786.6 million yuan in the first quarter, versus 649.8 million yuan during the same period last year. Research and development expenses rose 72.2% from a year ago to 535.1 million yuan. Xpeng pressed ahead with its European expansion plans in the first quarter by delivering more than 300 units of its G3 SUV to Norway, according to the company. The start-up had sent 100 of the cars to the market in December. Xpeng expects to begin delivering its P7 sedan to Norway in the second half of the year. Competition in that overseas market is set to pick up with rival Chinese electric car maker Nio's plans to open a showroom and begin deliveries in Norway later this year. Nio's shares fell 7.3% Thursday and are down nearly 36% for the year so far.
The People's Bank of China — and economists parsing its statements — are not as worried about inflation, or expecting much monetary policy change as the country faces more pressing risks. "Residents' consumption is still constrained and investment growth is insufficient," the central bank said in monetary policy report, according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese text. "If we have prices rising in China, it's not demand overheating domestically, which could warrant change of monetary policy to slow that," said Francoise Huang, senior economist at Euler Hermes.	BEIJING — While investors around the world fret over inflation, China's central bank has more problems than rising prices to worry about. Central banks worldwide have kept monetary policies easy and interest rates lower in a bid to support growth in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic last year, and China is no exception. Now as consumer and producer prices climb, investors are on edge as they try to discern if central banks will be raising interest rates. But the People's Bank of China — and economists parsing its statements — are not as worried about inflation, or expecting much monetary policy change as the country faces more pressing risks. In its report on first quarter monetary policy released late Tuesday, the central bank focused on how the foundation for China's economic recovery is not solid . "Residents' consumption is still constrained and investment growth is insufficient," the report said, according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese text. The PBOC added that smaller, privately run businesses still face difficulties, and ensuring employment remains a great challenge. The report talked at length about an increase in inflation globally, and forecast China's producer prices would rise later this year as commodity prices climb worldwide. The central bank also noted that rising inflation in major economies has increased the pressure of currency depreciation and capital flows for some emerging economies. Data out this week showed U.S. consumer prices posted their fastest increase since September 2008, at 4.2% in April, and producer prices rose 6.2% in their fastest increase in the PPI's roughly one-decade history. The S&P 500 has fallen more than 2% this week, while the 10-year Treasury briefly hit a one-month high of nearly 1.69%. It's not clear if the latest rise in U.S. inflation will be a negative for stocks in the long term. The Chinese 10-year government bond yield has held above 3.1%, while the Shanghai Composite has climbed 2% this week. China said Tuesday its producer prices rose in April by their fastest rate in more than three years — up 6.8%. But consumer prices edged up just 0.9% as pork prices fell. "If we have prices rising in China, it's not demand overheating domestically, which could warrant change of monetary policy to slow that," said Francoise Huang, senior economist at Euler Hermes, a subsidiary of Allianz, in a phone interview Wednesday. "I continue to think the policy rates will not be changed this year." The Chinese central bank has kept its benchmark lending rate, the loan prime rate, unchanged for a year. The next monthly announcement on the rate is due May 20. In its quarterly report this week, the central bank added that "prudent" monetary policy would be flexible, targeted and appropriate. Zong Liang, chief researcher at the Bank of China, doesn't expect China's monetary policy to change until the second half of the year, at the earliest. He noted the central bank kept policy relatively tighter in the last two years versus that of other countries. Although he expects Chinese consumers will pick up their spending in the second quarter, especially as China steps up local vaccinations, he said consumption is still in a period of recovery. In a sign of Beijing's caution on the economy, authorities said at a meeting Wednesday that pressure to support employment remains high. The central government decided at the meeting to extend pandemic-era support for unemployment until the end of this year. However, the level of support was scaled back from what it was last year. China's economy grew 18.3% in the first quarter, from a contraction last year amid the height of the pandemic. Separately, data out Wednesday showed loan growth slowed more than expected in April , which some economists said reflected credit tightening. "We think monetary conditions have likely tightened, but overall credit policy remains supportive for a more balanced recovery of the real economy, considering the relatively robust medium-term and long-term loan growth," said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance. "The sharper-than-expected slowdown in short-term loan issuance in April may also (be) due in part to regulators' increased scrutiny on the illegal use of business and consumption loans for property financing," he said. Real estate is one of the primary areas of investment — and speculation — in China. In an attempt to keep price gains from getting out of hand, authorities have tried to act cautiously. The People's Bank of China said in its first quarter monetary policy report that house prices must be kept stable, and emphasized that houses are for living, not speculation. Although markets appear to believe China will accelerate its exit from policies implemented in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, there isn't a strong case right now for the central bank to do so, said Li-Gang Liu, chief China economist at Citi Research. "Financial fragility has increased, represented by the enlarged property bubble, elevated debt level, and enhanced default risk," Liu said. "We think a hasty withdrawal of stimulus policies will also bring about new financial risks."
Retail sales rose 17.7% last month from a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday. That missed expectations of 24.9% growth in April, according to analysts polled by Reuters. Official commentary has noted for the last several months that the foundation for China's economic recovery is not yet solid.	BEIJING — In the latest sign of a sluggish recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, China said Monday that consumer spending grew at a slower-than-expected pace in April. Retail sales rose 17.7% last month from a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday. That missed expectations of 24.9% growth in April, according to analysts polled by Reuters. April's retail sales figure also marked a slowdown from 34.2% year-on-year growth in March. "China is still seeing an unbalanced recovery, as employment, household income, consumption, manufacturing investment, (the) service sector and private firms have yet to come back to (the) pre-Pandemic level," Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance, said in a statement. Catering sales, which includes restaurant dining, grew 46.4% year-on-year in April, down from 91.6% in March. Online sales of consumer goods rose 23.1% during the first four months of the year from a year ago, a slower pace than the 25.8% growth rate of the first three months of the year. The statistics bureau did not release single-month growth rates. In a quarterly monetary policy report released last week, the People's Bank of China noted that the foundation for economic recovery is not yet solid and consumer spending remains constrained. On Monday, the Statistics Bureau reiterated that the foundation for the economic recovery is not yet solid. The urban unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in April, down from 5.3% in March, but the average number of hours worked a week declined to 46.4 hours last month, from 46.9 hours in March. The unemployment rate for those aged 16 to 24 remained a high 13.6%, the data showed. Consumption has lagged China's overall economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Retail sales contracted last year despite expansion in China's GDP — the only major economy to grow last year. "Sectors related to travel, leisure and entertainment employ a lot of people," Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note. "The Covid uncertainty still holds these sectors back. "Economic growth likely peaked in Q1 on a quarter-on-quarter basis," he said, noting he expects growth to slow in coming months and that the probability of a central bank rate hike has declined. In another sign of persistent weakness in consumption, Chinese tourist trips during the May 1 to 5 Labor Day holiday surged to a record, but spending still fell short of 2019's levels. Other figures for April showed steady growth in non-consumer sectors. Industrial output rose 9.8% in April, matching Reuters' expectations. Fixed asset investment for the first four months of the year rose 19.9%, slightly above the 19% figure predicted by a Reuters poll. Earlier this month, China's customs agency said exports grew a more-than-expected 32.3% in April from a year ago.
South Korea became the latest country to announce a colossal investment in the industry last week. The nation's government said Thursday that 510 trillion South Korean won ($452 billion) will be invested in chips by 2030. The bulk of that will come from private companies in the country.	Tiny pieces of silicon with intricate circuits on them are the lifeblood of today's economy. These clever semiconductors make our internet-connected world go round. In addition to iPhones and PlayStations, they underpin key national infrastructure and sophisticated weaponry. But recently there haven't been enough of them to meet demand. The reasons for the ongoing global chip shortage, which is set to last into 2022 and possibly 2023 , are complex and multifaceted. However, nations are planning to pump billions of dollars into semiconductors over the coming years as part of an effort to sure up supply chains and become more self-reliant, with money going toward new chip plants, as well as research and development. South Korea became the latest country to announce a colossal investment in the industry last week. The nation's government said Thursday that 510 trillion South Korean won ($452 billion) will be invested in chips by 2030, with the bulk of that coming from private companies in the country. Abishur Prakash, a geopolitical specialist at the Center for Innovating the Future, a Toronto-based consulting firm, told CNBC by email that it's a "a wartime-like effort by South Korea to build future security and independence." "By building massive chip capabilities, South Korea will have the power to decide its own trajectory, instead of being forced in a specific direction," added Prakash. "This is also about not depending on China or Taiwan. By investing hundreds of billions of dollars, South Korea is ensuring that it is not pegged to other nations for its critical technology needs." Through the so-called "K-Semiconductor Strategy," the South Korean government said it will support the industry by offering tax breaks, finance, and infrastructure. In a speech on May 10, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said: "Amid the global economy's grand transformation, semiconductors are becoming a sort of key infrastructure in all industrial areas." He added: "While solidly keeping the status of our semiconductor industry as the world's best, we will safeguard our national interests by using the current semiconductor boom as an opportunity for a new leap forward." But South Korea isn't leading on all fronts. "In sheer manufacturing capacity, Taiwan is #1 and South Korea is #2, with the U.S. in third place and China gaining quickly," Glenn O'Donnell, VP and research director at analyst firm Forrester, told CNBC. South Korea has a commanding lead in memory chips with a 65% share, largely thanks to Samsung, he said. He added that Asia as a whole dominates in manufacturing, with 79% of all the world's chips produced on the continent in 2019. O'Donnell said it's "difficult to say" whether the investment will help South Korea seize the global chipmaking crown in the way that it wants to. "This is a monumental investment, but the U.S., Taiwan's TSMC, and the Chinese are also investing heavily," he said. South Korea's investment is being led by two of its biggest chip firms: Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. Samsung Electronics — the nation's biggest chipmaker and a rival to Taiwan's TSMC — is planning to invest 171 trillion won in non-memory chips through 2030, raising its previous investment target of 133 trillion won, which was announced in 2019. Elsewhere, SK Hynix, a semiconductor supplier of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips and flash memory chips, is planning to spend 230 trillion won in the next decade. A spokesperson for SK Hynix told CNBC that the company will spend 110 trillion won on its existing production sites in Icheon and Cheongju between now and 2030. It is also investing 120 trillion won into four new factories in Yongin, and separately plans to double the amount of chips it produces at its foundry business. Prakash said the world should be shocked at the size of the South Korea's overall war chest. "With almost half a trillion dollars, and the involvement of more than 150 companies, South Korea is moving mountains to secure its place in the future," he said. South Korea's pledge comes after U.S President Joe Biden proposed a $50 billion plan for chipmaking and research, while China's Xi Jinping has pledged to spend on high-tech industries, with a big emphasis on semiconductors. The EU said in March it wants 20% of the world's semiconductors to be manufactured in Europe by 2030, up from just 10% in 2010. "In the ongoing battle for dominance in the technology field, all nations are jockeying for that all-important designation as the key supplier to the world," said Forrester's O'Donnell. "South Korea, Japan, the U.S., Taiwan, the EU, and China all covet that gold medal in the Tech Olympics podium." O'Donnell noted that it takes about two years to build a chip manufacturing plant, or a fab. "Each fab will cost upwards of $10 billion, but all the money in the world won't solve the chip shortage quickly nor will it guarantee that gold medal." He added: "Geopolitical tensions also play into the dynamics. South Korea always lives under the threat from North Korea that will destabilize its tech position if things heat up too much across the DMZ. Taiwan, arguably the biggest current semiconductor supplier faces a similar threat as tensions heat up with mainland China." Outside South Korea, all of the major chip manufacturers have announced big investments of their own. TSMC has pledged to spend $100 billion over three years to grow its production capacity, while Intel is planning to build two new factories in Arizona with $20 billion. Both companies have also been in discussions about a new European factory, according to reports. Elsewhere, Chinese chipmaker SMIC said Friday it is working rapidly to expand capacity with some plans moving ahead of schedule. Haijun Zhao, the CEO, said on an earnings call that semiconductor demand in every customer segment continues to exceed supply. SMIC posted a 22% jump in first quarter sales to $1.1 billion and raised its sales outlook for the first half of the year.
The U.S. Treasury said Tuesday it was postponing a ban on trading shares of companies with alleged links to the Chinese military. The new restrictions take effect June 11, versus the prior date of May 27. The move by U.S. President Joe Biden's administration extends a grace period for investors to comply with an investment ban first announced in November under former President Donald Trump.	BEIJING — The U.S. Treasury said Tuesday it was postponing a ban on trading shares of companies with alleged links to the Chinese military. The new restrictions take effect June 11, versus the prior date of May 27. The move by U.S. President Joe Biden's administration extends a grace period for investors to comply with an investment ban first announced in November under former President Donald Trump . Only a handful of the names, mostly state-owned companies, are traded in the U.S. Earlier this month, the U.S. agreed to remove Hong Kong-listed Chinese smartphone maker  Xiaomi from the blacklist. But another company on the list, telecommunications giant China Mobile , said earlier this month it expected to delist from the New York Stock Exchange. The company subsequently said on Monday it would issue yuan-denominated shares on the Shanghai stock exchange. Chinese companies have rushed to go public in the U.S. in the last 18 months despite the political overhang. In late April, a representative from the New York Stock Exchange said about 60 Chinese companies plan to list in the U.S. this year.
The move has sparked outrage from conservationists, rights groups and local landowners, but the details of the deal, first reported by the U.K.'s The Guardian newspaper, remain hazy. "With the new shift in government policy for the development of the fisheries sector, the Chinese government has given a grant of US$55m to build this platform," Sierra Leone Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources Emma Kowa-Jalloh said in a press release Monday. Local policy research groups are requesting copies of environmental and social impact assessments, along with the grant agreement between China and the Sierra Leonean government.	Sierra Leone has agreed to sell 250 acres of pristine beach and rainforest to China in a $55 million deal that would see an industrial fishing harbor built on the site. The move has sparked outrage from conservationists, human rights and animal welfare groups and local landowners , who have said the project would "destroy pristine rainforest, plunder fish stocks, pollute the marine environment and five individual eco systems that are fish breeding grounds and support endangered bird and wildlife species." The details of the deal, first reported by the U.K.'s The Guardian newspaper , remain hazy. Local public policy research organizations the Institute for Legal Research and Advocacy for Justice (ILRAJ) and Namati Sierra Leone have written to the government requesting information on "plans to establish a fish harbour and carry out waste management operations at Black Johnson in the Western Area peninsula, a project funded by the Government of China." The groups are requesting copies of legally-mandated environmental and social impact assessments, along with the grant agreement between China and the Sierra Leonean government. Both the Chinese and Sierra Leonean embassies in London and the Sierra Leonean state house were unavailable for comment when contacted by CNBC. Black Johnson's waters are rich in fish and local fishermen supply a substantial portion of the domestic market. Meanwhile, the Western Area Peninsula national park houses many endangered species. A press release from Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources Emma Kowa-Jalloh on Monday contends that "the facility to be constructed is a Fish Harbour and not a Fish Mill as portrayed by the social media writers." "The objective of the Fish Harbour is to centralise all fishing activities. The government of Sierra Leone has been yearning for a Fish Harbour since the early 1970s, but could not actualise it due to the huge amount of money that is required," Kowa-Jalloh said. "With the new shift in government policy for the development of the fisheries sector, the Chinese government has given a grant of US$55m to build this platform." The release also asserts that Black Johnson was "the most suitable place for the construction of the facility in terms of bathymetry, social safeguards (minimum resettlement cost) and environmental issues." Kowa-Jalloh said the Ministry of Finance had set aside a compensation package of 13.76 billion leones (around $1.34 million) for landowners, and insisted that the sale of the land was intended to "ensure the regular supply of fish" to the local market. In a tweet Tuesday, Greenpeace Africa condemned the move, arguing that "fishing communities in West Africa are already experiencing the effects of environmental degradation and the climate crisis." "Permitting more extractive activities in this region will only worsen the situation," the organization added. The growth of China's overseas presence in infrastructure and economic development projects in Africa and beyond has been well-documented in recent years, but often such initiatives are financed through loan agreements . Professor Katharine Adeney of the University of Nottingham Asia Research Institute noted some apparent similarities between the Sierra Leone deal, given the current available details, and one portion of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. "The majority of the CPEC projects in Pakistan have been financed through loans. However, the development of Gwadar port, Gwadar International Airport and many 'hearts and minds' projects in the area are scheduled to be paid for by Chinese grants," she told CNBC on Tuesday. "This reflects the importance of the success of the project to China's strategic interest (the only other project financed through a grant was the development of the fiber optic cable from China into Pakistan, essential for the development of the Beidou satellite system)." Adeney noted that this may also be the case here, though Sierra Leone does not feature on the maritime "belt" of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the global infrastructure development strategy adopted by Beijing in 2013. The Gwadar project in Pakistan also faced staunch opposition from local fishermen displaced by the project, while concerns have been raised about whether the local labor force will be able to benefit from the project in the event of a sudden influx of workers from elsewhere in Pakistan or overseas. "The development of Gwadar includes a lot of hearts and minds projects on paper (e.g. the development of a training center, expansion of a hospital), but very few of these have yet come to fruition. The whole area has been heavily securitized," Adeney explained. Local activists in Sierra Leone have decried the government's lack of transparency in recent days as they seek clarity on the nature of the project. Robert Besseling, CEO of political risk consultancy Pangea-Risk, told CNBC on Tuesday that the opacity of the deal could end up "derailing it" or at least cause further resistance. "Firstly, there is a lack of transparency over the Sierra Leonean government's land equity and Chinese cash grant deal, which is raising concerns over potential corruption and could subject it to parliamentary probing," he said. "Secondly, any forced displacement of residents around the project site might be rendered unconstitutional based on current land rights provisions." Besseling noted that the fisheries deal deviated from the government's previous reluctance to deal with Chinese counterparties. Soon after taking office in April 2018, President Julius Maada Bio canceled several high-profile contracts, including a $400 million airport construction deal backed by a Chinese loan. The government argued at the time that there was no business case for the new airport outside the capital Freetown, and instead vowed to renovate its existing airport. "The lack of financing opportunities during the pandemic may indicate that Sierra Leone is increasingly returning to China's sphere of influence and is now seeking more Chinese lending for development and infrastructure projects," Besseling added.
The U.S. wants Russia to pivot away from China, and may be showing flexibility on sanctions as an "olive branch," according to Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit. Washington on Wednesday imposed sanctions on some vessels and entities involved in the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring natural gas from Russia to Germany. But some sanctions were waived "in the national interest of the United States," a press statement from the U.S. State Department said.	The U.S. wants Russia to pivot away from China, and may be showing flexibility on sanctions as an "olive branch," according to Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit. Washington on Wednesday imposed sanctions on some vessels and entities involved in the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring natural gas from Russia to Germany. But sanctions against the company running the project, its CEO Matthias Warnig and its corporate officers have been waived "in the national interest of the United States," a press statement from the U.S. State Department said. While the company is German, its CEO is an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Reuters reported that Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov had indicated the waiving of those sanctions may help normalize ties between the U.S. and Russia. Yergin described this as an "olive branch" to encourage Russia to back away from China at a time where U.S.-Russia relations are tense. "That is, I think, a priority strategy for this administration," he told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday at the sidelines of an Arctic Council ministerial meeting and acknowledged the differences between Washington and Moscow, but said the two sides can still work together. Ties between Moscow and Beijing have deepened in recent years, with the two countries cooperating on economic, political and defense issues. The countries' space agencies also signed a memorandum of understanding in March this year, committing to creating a new lunar space station. Yergin said Putin has been "increasingly estranged from the West" since the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. On the other hand, China is a growth market for Russia, and Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are "like-minded about what they call absolute sovereignty," he said. Being flexible on sanctions is partly a U.S. strategy to "peel Russia back from its … growing alliance with China" despite difficulties between Washington and Moscow, said Yergin. The U.S. has long voiced objections against the pipeline project, and Yergin said the Biden administration's decision to waive certain sanctions would not go down well with lawmakers. "One of the few things that unites Democrats and Republicans is wanting to put sanctions on Russia," he said. A press statement attributed to Blinken said the U.S. will "continue to oppose the completion of this project, which would weaken European energy security and that of Ukraine and Eastern flank NATO and EU countries." But Yergin said the Biden administration probably realizes that it is not possible to keep Russian gas out of Europe. "It's just the question of how the gas is going to go there," he said. The waiving of sanctions may also strengthen relations with Germany, he added.
China's ambitions to take a more significant role in the Arctic are likely to lead to growing tensions, according to Oksana Antonenko, a director at risk consultancy firm Control Risks. Beijing announced plans for a "Polar Silk Road" in 2018 and previously referred to itself as a "near-Arctic state," a proposition that ignited some controversy.	China's ambitions to take a more significant role in the Arctic will likely lead to growing tensions, according to risk consultancy firm Control Risks. China has developed a "prominent presence" in the region since joining the Arctic Council as an observer in 2013, Oksana Antonenko, director at Control Risks, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia." The Arctic Council is made up of eight Arctic states — Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States. It is an intergovernmental group that seeks to promote cooperation among the Arctic states as well as inhabitants of the Arctic. Their goal is to ensure the Arctic region, which faces harsh climates and extreme weather conditions, is protected and sustainably developed. In 2018, Beijing announced plans to build the "Polar Silk Road" — a network of Arctic shipping routes. It has also previously referred to itself as a "near-Arctic state," a proposition that ignited some controversy. China is about 900 miles (1,448 km) from the Arctic Circle at its closest point. Antonenko said Arctic states are concerned about China "playing a much more assertive role unilaterally." At the same time, Russia — which is facing Western sanctions targeting energy exploration in the Arctic — is getting funding from China. "China is providing investment, and therefore wants to take a much more significant role in allowing … transportation by the northern sea route," she said ahead of the Arctic Council's ministerial meeting on Thursday. "We're likely to see, potentially, growing tensions between China and the littoral states in the Arctic," she said. Alexander Gabuev of the Carnegie Moscow Center said Russia has "expanding interest" in developing large energy projects in the Arctic, but doesn't have the necessary capital. "It sees China as a potential investor and as a potential … market for hydrocarbons," said Gabuev, a senior fellow and chair of the Russia in the Asia-Pacific program. Despite growing cooperation, Russia doesn't want China to become a full member of the Arctic Council, he said. "Russia worked together with the U.S. and other full members in order to make the observers basically voiceless," he told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Wednesday. "They sit at the table in the Arctic Council, but they don't have real power and I think that this is a shared interest between all of the Arctic powers," he added.
Microsoft's China arm announced Thursday a strategic partnership with Chinese retail tech company Hanshow to collaborate on cloud-based software for store operators worldwide. The deal marks Microsoft's latest foray into a retail industry that is being forced to accelerate a shift online. Right now, Hanshow's primary customers are supermarkets in China and Europe.	BEIJING — Microsoft 's China arm announced Thursday a strategic partnership with Chinese retail tech company Hanshow to collaborate on cloud-based software for store operators worldwide. The deal marks Microsoft's latest foray into a retail industry that is being forced to accelerate a shift online. The integration of offline with internet-based sales strategies is known as omni-channel retail, and includes grocery delivery , demand for which surged in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Retail is one of the industries that's seen some of the biggest disruptions in recent years, Joe Bao, China strategy officer for Microsoft, said at a signing ceremony at the software company's Beijing offices. The partnership is not just for the China market, but also for bringing China's technology overseas, Bao said in Mandarin, according to a CNBC translation. He said the agreement comes after five years of Microsoft working with Hanshow. The American software company entered China in 1992, where it has its biggest overseas research and development center. The strategic partnership comes as U.S. and Chinese companies operate in an increasingly tense political environment that has focused on trade and technology, partly in response to longstanding foreign criticism about unfair Chinese business practices . Right now, Hanshow's primary customers are supermarkets in China and Europe. The company says its products include electronic store shelf labels that can reflect price changes in real time, and a system that helps workers shorten the time it takes to pack produce for delivery. Hanshow says it also sells a cloud-based platform that allows a retailer to simultaneously see the temperatures of fresh produce in stores around the world. The partnership will include collaboration on internet-connected, or internet of things, technology. As part of the deal, Hanshow will use Microsoft's Office 365 software such as Word, and Dynamics 365, a cloud-based customer relationship management system, said Gao Bo, chief architect at Hanshow, told CNBC in an interview following the signing ceremony. He said the two companies can share their global client network and will jointly launch a research and development team. Founded in Beijing about a decade ago, Hanshow lists offices in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Denmark and Australia on its website. Hanshow has just established a branch in the U.S., according to the company. Globalization is one of Hanshow's important business strategies, Gao said in Mandarin, according to a CNBC translation. He claimed that the company's first step when entering a foreign market is to understand local laws and culture, and that his own work hasn't been significantly affected by international trade tensions. "Offline stores aren't going to die out," Gao said, adding that "the uncertainty in the future is what the ratio will be."
Interest in mainland Chinese bonds has picked up, especially from foreign institutional investors, said Jason Pang, portfolio manager of the JPMorgan China Bond Opportunities Fund. The foreign share of mainland China's bond market — the second largest in the world — reached 3.44% in April, up from 3.2% in December, according to Natixis. Meanwhile, Wall Street giants such as BlackRock are taking advantage of looser government restrictions to expand their China businesses.	BEIJING — Foreign investors and financial institutions are still keen to invest in China despite geopolitical tensions — and a lot more overseas money could be coming into the country, according analysts. Differences in monetary policy and stages of recovery from the coronavirus pandemic have contributed to persistently higher Chinese government bond yields compared with those in the U.S. and Europe. While economists note "unbalanced" recovery from the pandemic, China's relatively faster growth — and population of 1.4 billion people — has more investors looking for opportunities. Interest in mainland Chinese bonds has picked up, especially from foreign institutional investors, according to Jason Pang, portfolio manager of the JPMorgan China Bond Opportunities Fund. Launched last year, the fund had $124 million in client assets under management as of the end of April. "The message hasn't changed. The only change is the interest has changed sharply in the first quarter," he said. Pang expects the foreign share of China's government bond market to reach 15% in the next three to five years. If that forecast is correct, far more overseas money is set to enter China. The foreign share of mainland China's bond market — the second largest in the world after the U.S. — reached 3.44% in April, up from 3.2% in December, according to Natixis. The firm found that foreign investors bought a net 58 billion ($9 billion) of mainland Chinese bonds in April, more than reversing net sales of 9 billion yuan in March. Looking ahead, Citi expects $300 billion to enter the bond market as a result of FTSE Russell officially adding China to its World Government Bond Index in October. Interest from foreign institutional investors in entering the market has surged, according to Vicky Tsai, Head of Securities Services for Citi China. Since the securities regulator in November loosened restrictions on an investment channel for overseas capital into China, demand for the relevant Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) license has gone up, she said. “We assisted many foreign investors in applying and obtain(ing) QFII licenses, including several top-tiered global hedge fund and private fund management companies with sizeable investments or plans," Tsai said in an email. She did, however, note a slowdown in the pace in the last two months, due partly to a sharp drop in mainland Chinese stocks earlier this year and relatively stronger performance in U.S. and other Asia Pacific markets. Foreigners' share of mainland Chinese stocks — known as A shares — edged down from 4.29% in December to 4.27% in March, although that is still well above the 3.35% level recorded a year ago, according to Natixis. Finance is one of the few industries that Chinese authorities have finally opened further to foreigners —amid increased political tensions with the U.S. Data from Rhodium Group released this week showed U.S. foreign direct investment in China dropped by roughly a third in 2020 from a year ago to $8.7 billion, the lowest since 2004. But Wall Street giants are expanding their China businesses as Beijing has pressed ahead in the last three years with efforts to increase foreign investment in the country's capital markets, as well as allow foreign firms greater control of their local operations. BlackRock announced on May 12 it has received regulatory approval to begin asset management in China through a joint venture with a subsidiary of China Construction Bank and Singapore's Temasek. BlackRock will own 50.1%, while Temasek will hold a 9.9% stake. Separately, Bloomberg reported this week, citing a source, that Goldman Sachs is hiring 320 staff in mainland China and Hong Kong . There are plans for 100 more positions later this year, the report said. The investment bank declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. However, analysts from Natixis noted business expansion may not necessarily bring significantly more investment flows into China. One long-standing concern international investors have about the mainland market is their ability to take capital out. The domestic financial industry also has a relatively less developed regulatory structure, while remaining prone to speculative activity. "Chinese clients have gone through a mini boom-bust in the equities market in the past quarter," Patrick Pei, chief investment strategist at China-based Hywin Wealth Management, said in an email. He said that mutual funds, a major way in which onshore clients participate in the market, saw record levels of fundraising in the first quarter and "sudden dissipation" in the second. "Overall we are not seeing a significant shift of interest in Chinese government bonds," Pei said. "Despite factors such as the rhetoric of inflation pressure from the US and the Sino-US political dynamics, the rates differential between China and the US is expected to last, though this is likely to gradually shrink." The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has held near 1.63% this week, while its Chinese counterpart has fallen from 3.19% to 3.15%, according to data from Wind Information. Clarification: This story has been updated to reflect that Pang expects the foreign share of China's government bond market to reach 15% in the next three to five years.
The price of Bitcoin rebounded above the $38,000 level Monday after plummeting to less than $32,000 on Sunday. Bitcoin was up around 16.32% at $38,071.64 in the 24 hours leading up to 2:40 a.m. ET, according to CoinDesk data Ether rose from less than $1,800 on Sunday to over $2,500 on Monday.	The crypto market edged higher Monday after a week of hell during which billions of dollars were wiped off the value of bitcoin and ether. The price of Bitcoin rebounded above the $39,000 level Monday after plummeting to less than $32,000 on Sunday. Shares of the world's largest cryptocurrency jumped more than 20% to $39,739.40 by 4:06 p.m. ET, according to Coin Metrics, after Tesla CEO Elon Musk and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor tweeted about meeting with North American bitcoin miners about "sustainability initiatives." Ether, the world's second most popular cryptocurrency, rose from less than $1,800 on Sunday to over $2,600 on Monday. It was trading around $2,647.53 by 4:07 p.m. ET – up 34.7%, according to Coin Metrics. Elsewhere, dogecoin also showed signs of recovery, with its price rising from 24 cents on Sunday to 36 cents on Monday. Broadly speaking, the crypto market was a sea of green on Monday, with just a few lesser-known coins down in the previous 24 hours. Last week's crypto sell-off came after authorities in China and the U.S. moved to tighten regulation and tax compliance on cryptocurrencies. Chinese authorities called for tighter regulation on crypto mining and trading on Friday, and the U.S. Treasury announced Thursday that it would require stricter crypto compliance with the IRS. Bitcoin on Wednesday plunged more than 30% at one point to nearly $30,000, its lowest price since late January, according to Coin Metrics. The cryptocurrency peaked in April near $65,000. The sell-off was a major reversal for the cryptocurrency, which appeared to be gaining traction among major Wall Street banks and publicly traded companies. This month, however, bitcoin has been hit by a series of negative headlines from major influencers and regulators. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who helped fuel bullish sentiment when his company announced in February it has bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, delivered a blow earlier this month when he announced that the automaker had suspended vehicle purchases using the cryptocurrency over environmental concerns. Musk subsequently sent mixed messages about his position on bitcoin, implying in a tweet that Tesla may have sold its holdings, only to clarify later that it had not done so. "The asset class continues to be highly volatile, with the potential of significant price movements resulting from a single tweet or public comment," CIBC analyst Stephanie Price said in a note Thursday. A JPMorgan report showed that large institutional investors were dumping bitcoin in favor of gold, raising questions about institutional support for the cryptocurrency. — Additional reporting by CNBC's Hannah Miao.
President Joe Biden addressed the sweeping sanctions his administration imposed on Russia, a move that seeks to address a litany of malign behaviors and is expected to peeve Moscow. "If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I'm prepared to take further actions to respond. It is my responsibility as president of the United States to do so," Biden said from the White House. The Biden administration unleashed several sanctions that named 32 Russian individuals and entities for their roles in attempting to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election.	WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden on Thursday addressed the sweeping sanctions his administration imposed on Russia, a move that seeks to address a litany of malign behaviors and is expected to peeve Moscow. "If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I'm prepared to take further actions to respond. It is my responsibility as president of the United States to do so," Biden said from the White House. "I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so, I chose to be proportionate," Biden said of the measures, adding that he did not want to "kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia." Biden also said that he proposed in a phone call with Putin that the two meet in person this summer in Europe to discuss a range of pressing issues. The Biden administration unleashed several sanctions that named 32 Russian individuals and entities for their roles in attempting to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election, five individuals and three entities linked to Russia's illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, and six technology companies for supporting support Russian Intelligence Services. In addition, the State Department announced the expulsion of 10 officials from the Russian Embassy in Washington. Russia has long brushed off allegations of meddling in U.S. elections, human rights abuses, cyberattacks as well as reports of placing bounties on U.S. troops serving in Afghanistan. Last month, the Biden administration issued its first sanctions on Russia over the alleged poisoning and subsequent detention of Putin critic Alexey Navalny. Navalny, a leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, flew to Russia from Berlin , where he spent nearly half a year recovering for a nerve agent poisoning that took place last August. He was arrested at passport control and later sentenced to more than two years in prison . The U.S. reiterated its calls for his immediate release. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied having a role in Navalny's poisoning. Russia described the latest moves by the White House as a blow to bilateral relations and vowed to impose swift retaliatory measures. The Kremlin also blamed the United States for weakening the diplomatic relations between Washington and Moscow. Also on Thursday, Biden signed an executive order that allows Washington to sanction any sector of Moscow's economy, significantly broadening the scope of sanctions authority. Under this new authorization, U.S. banks are prohibited from conducting transactions in the primary market for new ruble or non-ruble-denominated bonds from Russia after June 14. A senior Biden administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the measure as having a rippling effect in the Russian economy. "When you remove U.S. investors from the primary market, it causes a broader chilling effect," the official explained. "What you see is that Russia's borrowing costs rise, you see that there's capital flight and you see the currency weakens in tandem. And you know, that has an impact on Russia's growth rate and it has an impact on Russia's inflation rate," the official added. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov described the new sanctions as a missed opportunity for U.S. banks and investors, adding that he expected demand for Russia's state debt to remain high. Siluanov also said that the ministry will closely monitor market conditions. The Central Bank of Russia also said on Thursday that it was carefully watching the market and that it was "ready to use the tools at its disposal in order to maintain financial stability." The sanctions package comes on the heels of a Tuesday call between Biden and Putin , the second between the two leaders since the Democratic president took office in January. Biden later described the call as "candid and respectful." On the call, Biden proposed holding a summit somewhere outside the U.S. and Russia "to discuss the full range of issues facing" the countries. The Kremlin later on Tuesday said in a statement that Biden had "suggested considering the possibility of holding a personal summit meeting in the foreseeable future." A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that Biden informed Putin of his decision to impose the sanctions. "We also want to be clear that we have no desire to be in an escalatory cycle with Russia, we intend these responses to be proportionate and tailored to the specific past activities, paths, actions that Russia has taken," the official said. The administration official declined to speculate on possible retaliatory actions Moscow would take on the heels of the sweeping sanctions.
Rep. John Katko has not ruled out running, sources said. He faces a potentially tough reelection campaign in New York's 24th Congressional District.	A Republican congressman who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump is being recruited to run for New York governor next year, according to people briefed on the matter. Rep. John Katko has not ruled out running, said these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the private nature of the conversations. Gov. Andrew Cuomo is under fire for multiple scandals. Several women have accused him of sexual harassment, which he denies, while his administration is under investigation for its handling of Covid-19 death data. The Democratic governor has refused calls to resign and has been on track to run for a fourth term. Katko, who has called for Cuomo's resignation, is a prominent member of the House Republican caucus. He is the ranking member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, potentially putting him in line to be chairman if the GOP Republicans retake the House during 2022's midterm elections. But Katko could face stumbling blocks running for Congress again: There is the potential for backlash within his own party for his impeachment vote, and he represents a swing district. Katko's campaign raised over $400,000 in the first quarter, and has over $580,000 on hand going into April, according to Federal Election Commission records. The race in his district, New York's 24th, is pegged as a toss up next year, according to the analysts at Cook Political Report. The district, which includes Syracuse, is one of at least 17 House Republican races deemed competitive. President Joe Biden won Katko's district over former President Donald Trump by close to 9 points. Republicans made gains in the House during last year's election and are only a handful of seats away from becoming the majority. Press representatives for Katko's congressional office and 2022 reelection campaign did not return repeated requests for comment. The recruitment push for Katko shows that members of the GOP are seeking a more moderate contender for the highest office in a traditionally Democratic state. Fellow New York GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin has already declared his candidacy for governor. Andrew Giuliani, son of former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, has said he might run on the Republican ticket. Zeldin, Giuliani and others are set to speak at Monday's New York Republican meeting in Albany for statewide contenders, according to a person briefed on the matter. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who has publicly not ruled out running for governor in 2022, is also on the speakers list. Katko is not expected to attend, this person added. Katko is chair of the moderate Republican Governance Group. His voting record indicates he isn't necessarily a hardliner, either. While Katko has pushed back on certain pieces of the Affordable Care Act, he voted no on repealing it in its entirety in 2015 . Katko later voted against the Affordable Health Care Act, the Republican's replacement for the ACA that passed the House but failed to get through the Senate. Cuomo has said he wants to run for a fourth term despite being under scrutiny. Polling is mixed for Cuomo. A Morning Consult poll from March shows that 53% of New York voters approve of Cuomo. Yet a Quinnipiac poll taken last month says that over 60% of the registered New York voters surveyed would prefer for Cuomo to not run again in 2022.
A now-disbarred lawyer who pleaded guilty to federal crimes related to shell company scams is listed as an attorney in early financial documents filed by Hometown International. Hometown's stock valuation has risen as high as $100 million or more despite owning just a single, small delicatessen. The former lawyer, Gregg Jaclin, was copied on communications filed by the company, Hometown International, with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015 and 2016, records show. The president and CEO of Hometown International, which owns Your Hometown Deli in Paulsboro, New Jersey, is Paul Morina, the local high school principal and renowned coach of its wrestling team.	A now-disbarred lawyer who pleaded guilty to federal crimes related to shell company scams is listed as an attorney in early financial documents filed by a New Jersey firm whose stock valuation has risen as high as $100 million or more despite owning just a single, small delicatessen. The former lawyer, Gregg Jaclin, was copied on communications filed by deli owner Hometown International with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015 and 2016, records show. They include the very first document filed by Hometown with the SEC that is publicly available. In June 2020, Jaclin pleaded guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Separately, in a related case, the SEC in 2019 entered a final judgment against him "for running a fraudulent shell factory scheme through which sham companies were taken public and sold for a profit," a press release noted that year. The companies involved in that conduct — none of which were Hometown International — were incorporated in Nevada with the assistance of Jaclin, who was disbarred in New Jersey last October for his actions. Records show that Hometown International, while having its sole business in southern New Jersey, was itself incorporated in Nevada. In a 2015 letter to Hometown International, SEC staff wrote, "We believe you are a shell company." Hometown International and its executives have not been accused by the SEC or other government authorities of wrongdoing. Hometown International's stock, which trades on the over-the-counter market, plummeted by about 33% in the hours after trading began Friday morning. A day earlier, CNBC had published articles about the company's unusually high market capitalization, which was first noted in a letter hedge fund manager David Einhorn sent to clients. "The pastrami must be amazing," Einhorn quipped in his letter. Share prices significantly recovered during the day. Hometown's stock closed at $12.99 per share Friday, down 3.78% from the previous day. Jaclin, who is still serving his sentence of three years of supervised release for his criminal case , did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did other figures connected to Hometown International, among them its top corporate officers and current lawyer, and whoever monitors the company's voicemail, when CNBC reached out to them. Paul Morina is the president and CEO of Hometown International, which owns the Your Hometown Deli in Paulsboro, New Jersey. Morina is also the principal and head coach of the renowned wrestling team at Paulsboro High School. SEC documents show that he holds 1.5 million shares of Hometown stock, with warrants for 30 million more shares. Hometown's vice president and secretary is Christine Lindenmuth, a math teacher and administrator at the same high school. Lindenmuth's home address is listed as the mailing address of Hometown International. The biographies of Morina and Lindenmuth in SEC filings do not mention any prior experience by either of them in the food service industry, a publicly traded corporation, or the financial industry. Hometown's deli had sales of just $35,000 or so for the past two fiscal years. The deli was closed from mid-March to early September last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic . Despite that, its nearly 8 million shares of common stock recently traded at levels of nearly $14 per share, giving it a market capitalization in excess of $100 million. A woman who answered the phone Friday at the deli asked, "Would you like to place an order?" She then hung up after the caller identified himself as a reporter and said he wanted to speak to someone about Hometown International. In SEC filings, Homeland is blunt about its business prospects. "Our financial situation creates doubt whether we will continue as a going concern." the company says in a filing. The company suggests it needs to find an acquisition target or additional financing to maintain operations. "Future success is highly dependent on the ability of management to locate and attract a suitable acquisition," Hometown said in a filing last year. Key shareholders of Hometown International also include entities in Hong Kong and Macao, China, a mecca for high net worth gamblers. The chairman of Hometown, Peter Coker Jr., is listed as the chairman of a Hometown investor that also has operated a luxury hotel in Macao known as The 13. That hotel has boasted of a fleet of Rolls-Royce Phantoms available as limousines for the hotel's guests. Online booking sites indicate The 13 hotel is not currently accepting reservations. Coker's father, Peter Coker Sr., is listed in financial filings as another key shareholder in Hometown. The elder Coker, who lives in North Carolina, is listed on the SEC filing as owning 63,334 shares of common stock in Hometown International, with warrants for 1.26 million more shares. The elder Coker has been identified in other SEC-filed documents as the founder and managing director of Tryon Capital Ventures, a North Carolina entity. Hometown pays Tryon $15,000 a month under a consulting agreement. "We anticipate extending the term of the Consulting Agreement with Tryon for an additional one-year term," Hometown's annual report says. In 2019, an investor named W. Robert Bizzell sued Peter Coker Sr. and other managing partners of an entity dubbed Tryon Capital LLC in North Carolina Business Court, records show. The lawsuit, among other things, alleged fraud in the inducement and constructive fraud in connection with getting Bizzell to invest in another Coker Sr.-linked entity, SSAC Capital. It also said that Bizzell's money was meant to help expand a specialty retail operation of Chapel Hill-based Southern Season. Bizzell's suit said the defendants "deviated from" their stated use of his money, which amounted to hundreds and thousands of dollars and converted his interest as a debtor into equity. Coker Sr. and the other defendants denied Bizzell's allegations. A filing in August 2020 indicated that the lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed by Bizzell with prejudice, which is normal when civil lawsuits are settled by the parties out of court. John Marshall, a lawyer for Bizzell, declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. He said he was bound by the terms of a confidentiality provision in the settlement agreement. Coker Sr. did not return requests for comment. A lawyer for him did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Public records show that Coker Sr. lived in Macungie, Pennsylvania. In 1992, The Morning Call newspaper in nearby Allentown published an article that said American Express Bank, in a bankruptcy case filed by Peter Coker, claimed he had "fraudulently conveyed hundreds of thousands of dollars of his assets to thwart its collection efforts on nearly $900,000." In court papers, the newspaper said, American Express had said Coker "is a solvent debtor who wishes to appear insolvent."
The Department of Justice sued Roger Stone, the loyal former advisor to ex-President Donald Trump, alleging he and his wife owe nearly $2 million in unpaid federal taxes and other fees. The lawsuit accuses Stone and Nydia Stone of using an "alter ego" company in an attempt to "shield their personal income from enforced collection and fund a lavish lifestyle." The civil complaint also alleges the Stones "intended to defraud the United States" through a fraudulent transfer of money used to buy their house.	The Department of Justice on Friday sued Roger Stone, the loyal former advisor to ex-President Donald Trump, alleging he and his wife owe nearly $2 million in unpaid federal taxes and other fees. The lawsuit accuses Stone and Nydia Stone of using an "alter ego" company in an attempt to "shield their personal income from enforced collection and fund a lavish lifestyle." The civil complaint also alleges the Stones "intended to defraud the United States" through a fraudulent transfer of money used to buy their house. Stone, 68, a longtime Republican political operative, was pardoned by Trump in December after being convicted of lying to Congress. The DOJ's complaint, filed in southern Florida federal court, alleges Stone and his wife underpaid their federal income taxes for five straight years, from 2007 and 2011. The Stones owe $1,590,361.89, including interest and late-payment penalties, according to the complaint. The lawsuit also alleges Stone did not pay his full tax bill in 2018, when he filed separately from his spouse. He owes $407,036.84 in income taxes, interest and penalties for that year, the complaint says. "Despite notice and demand for payment, Roger and Nydia Stone have failed and refused to pay the entire amount of the liabilities they owe," the DOJ alleges. Stone did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment on the lawsuit. The complaint alleges that the Stones "evaded and frustrated the IRS's collection efforts" through their use of a Delaware limited liability company called Drake Ventures. The company is "dominated and controlled" by the family "to such an extent that it does not exist as an independent entity," the DOJ alleges. Drake Ventures has no website or phone number, all of its members are part of Stone's family and its address is the same as the Stones' home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the complaint says. "The Stones used Drake Ventures' bank accounts to pay a substantial amount of their personal expenses, including groceries, dentist bills, spas, salons, clothing and restaurant expenses," according to the complaint. They also paid more than $500,000 of their personal tax liabilities through Drake Ventures' bank accounts in 2018 and 2019, and they used the company to pay Stone's associates and relatives without providing the right paperwork, the DOJ alleges. "The Stones used Drake Ventures for an improper purpose and harm to the United States," according to the complaint. "They used Drake Ventures to receive payment that are payable to Roger Stone personally, pay their personal expenses, shield their assets, and avoid reporting taxable income to the IRS." The DOJ's lawsuit also accuses the Stones of fraudulently conveying their house through a Florida revocable trust they created called the Bertran Trust. The Stones had struck a deal with the IRS in May 2017 to pay $19,485 per month toward their unpaid taxes, the complaint says. After Stone was indicted in January 2019 , his family created the Bertran Trust and bought their house in its name, using money they had transferred into that entity from Drake Ventures to make a $140,000 down payment. In March 2019, the Stones failed to make their monthly payment to the IRS, prompting the agency to scrap the installment plan. "The Stones intended to defraud the United States by maintaining their assets in Drake Ventures' accounts, which they completely controlled, and using these assets to purchase the Stone Residence in the name of the Bertran Trust," the complaint alleges. The DOJ says "numerous badges of fraud" marked the purchase. The complaint alleges the Stones were insolvent and "unable to pay to their debt;" facing the threat of litigation; and anticipating that the IRS would "resort to enforced collection of their unpaid tax liabilities once they defaulted on their monthly installment payments."
Biden's order to limit admissions to 15,000 was a blow to advocacy groups that wanted the Democratic president to move swiftly to reverse the refugee policies of the Republican Trump, who had set the figure in part as a way to limit immigration. The program for admitting refugees is distinct from the asylum system for migrants.	President Joe Biden said on Saturday he will raise the cap on the number of refugees admitted this year to the United States, a day after he drew criticism from Democratic lawmakers for agreeing to keep the historically low figure in place. Biden signed an order on Friday extending a 15,000 refugee admissions cap issued by his predecessor Donald Trump through the end of September. In signing the order, Biden shelved a plan announced in February to increase the cap to 62,500. Biden told reporters in Delaware on Saturday after playing golf that he would go beyond the 15,000 limit. "We are going to increase the number. Problem was the refugee part was working on the crisis that ended up at the border with young people. We couldn't do two things at once, so now we are going to raise the number," he said. With Biden being criticized by lawmakers and refugee advocacy groups, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday that he planned to "set a final, increased refugee cap for the remainder of this fiscal year by May 15." Biden's order to limit admissions to 15,000 was a blow to advocacy groups that wanted the Democratic president to move swiftly to reverse the refugee policies of the Republican Trump, who had set the figure in part as a way to limit immigration. The program for admitting refugees is distinct from the asylum system for migrants. Refugees must be vetted while still overseas and cleared for entry to the United States, unlike migrants who arrive at a U.S. border and then request asylum. Biden's cautious approach appears to have been tied to concerns over the optics of admitting more refugees at a time of rising numbers of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, and to not wanting to look "too open" or "soft," another U.S. official with knowledge of the matter previously told Reuters. Psaki said on Friday that Biden's "initial goal of 62,500 seems unlikely ... given the decimated refugee admissions program we inherited." Republicans have blamed Biden for the situation at the border, faulting his moves to reverse other Trump-era hardline immigration policies. Biden took office aiming to set a new course for U.S. immigration policy, including a more compassionate approach. But his initial decision to leave in place the caps went against his promises as a candidate.
Iran is now enriching uranium at 60%, close to military grade. The decision to increase enrichment comes after an explosion at a nuclear site in Natanz. Iran has blamed Israel for the attack. Talks aimed at reviving the nuclear deal between Iran, the U.S. and other powers were held in Vienna this week. Israel is not a party to the talks, but is watching them closely and has vowed to destroy Iran's nuclear program if all else fails. Gen. Amos Yadlin, former head of Israeli military intelligence, tells CNBC that stopping Iran will be tougher than past efforts against Iraq and Syria.	As Iran boosts uranium enrichment to 60%, a short jump to military grade at 90%, world powers are trying to coax the Islamic Republic to take a pause. Meetings designed to return both Iran and the United States to a form of the nuclear deal signed in 2015, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, restarted in Austria this week. While Israel is not a part of the talks, it is a main player in the drama that could quickly escalate. Israel, along with its Arab allies including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia want the U.S. to increase the pressure on Iran by strengthening the JCPOA to include terrorism, missile development and what they call "Iran's expansionism" throughout the Middle East. Iran and Israel have been engaged in a shadow war that has intensified in the last month.  An explosion disrupted one of Iran's nuclear power centers in Natanz; one of Iran's spy ships was hit with an explosive device in the Red Sea; and at least two Israeli owned cargo ships have been targeted. Iran's decision to increase uranium enrichment came after the explosion at Natanz, which the Islamic Republic has blamed on Israel. Israel has vowed to destroy Iran's nuclear program if all else fails, and they have experience in that arena. Forty years ago in June 1981, eight Israeli F-16s took off, flew over the Red Sea, straddled the Jordanian – Saudi border, and dropped their bombs on Iraq's nuclear power plant in Osirak days before it was set to go hot.  It was called Operation Opera and one of the pilots was Gen. Amos Yadlin. In 2007, Yadlin, while serving as the head of military intelligence for the Israeli army, helped design a second operation.  This one targeted Syria's secret nuclear power plant.  Operation Orchard was also a success — the target was completely destroyed. Yadlin said if it comes down to it, this time will be very different: "Saddam and Assad were surprised.  Iran has been waiting for this attack for 20 years." Yadlin said Iran's program is "much more fortified and dispersed," while Iraq and Syria's nuclear programs were concentrated in one place.  Iran's nuclear program is in dozens of sites, many buried deep beneath mountains.  On top of that, it isn't clear intelligence agencies know all the details about the locations of Iran's program. "Iran has learned from what we have done but we have also learned from what we have done and now we have more capabilities," said Yadlin. Military planners in Israel say, regardless of the Vienna talks, they have five strategies to stop Iran: Because of the strength of the ayatollahs – their control of the military, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard and a powerful force known for its brutality, the Basij – fomenting internal rebellion is a long shot. However, the regime is increasingly unpopular at home and the country has seen several protests erupt in the last few years, according to Ali Nader, an Iran analyst with the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. The main reason for those protests is a faltering economy, hard hit by U.S. sanctions which serve as the main American leverage against Iran in the nuclear talks in Vienna. "The U.S. has a complete chokehold on Iran's economy," said Nader.  In 2018, Iran held cash reserves worth more than $120 billion. Due to sanctions, that stockpile fell to about $4 billion in 2020, according to estimates from the International Monetary Fund.  The first thing Iran wants during these talks is for the U.S. to ease sanctions, allowing it to sell oil to Asia and Europe freely.  According to the International Energy Agency, which monitors oil production and shipments, Iran is getting around sanctions and increasing supply to China. In January, Iranian oil shipments to China hit record levels. Nader believes the U.S., by not doing more to enforce those sanctions, is signaling it is ready to make a deal. The big question for the talks, however, is who has leverage in what is becoming a game of chicken. Henry Rome is watching the negotiations as an analyst for Eurasia Group.  He isn't expecting a breakdown or a breakthrough as both sides try and get the other to make the first move. With Iran set to elect a new president in two months, Rome said "Iran does not want to be seen as desperate, the Supreme Leader would prefer to wait until after the June 18 election before having to make any concessions at all." "Iran is playing a weak hand, but they're very good at doing that," Rome said. Yadlin is nervous the U.S. will be too eager for a deal and give away too much, repeating what he calls are the mistakes of the 2015 deal. Yadlin points to Iran's enrichment achievements, hitting the symbolic 60% mark. "The first deal is proving to be a problem, look how fast they are moving," Yadlin said. "They could have enough enriched uranium to get to two or three bombs quickly." While there still may be some work to do in terms of delivery methods and weaponization, Yadlin has no doubt they have the knowledge to make nuclear bombs.
White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Sunday that the Biden administration warned the Russian government to not let jailed Putin critic Alexey Navalny die in custody. "We have communicated that there will be consequences if Mr. Navalny dies," Sullivan said. Russian authorities have previously said that they have offered Navalny proper medical care but that he continues to refuse it. The prison has declined to allow a doctor of Navalny's choice from outside of the facility to administer his treatment.	WASHINGTON – White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Sunday that the Biden administration warned the Russian government to not let jailed Putin critic Alexei Navalny die in custody. "We have communicated to the Russian government that what happens to Mr. Navalny in their custody is their responsibility and they will be held accountable by the international community," Sullivan said on CNN's "State of the Union" program. "We have communicated that there will be consequences if Mr. Navalny dies," he added. Navalny flew to Russia from Berlin earlier this year after spending nearly half a year recovering for a nerve agent poisoning that took place last August. He was arrested at passport control and later sentenced to more than two years in prison . Last month, the United States sanctioned seven members of the Russian government for the alleged poisoning and subsequent detention of Navalny. The sanctions were the first to target Moscow under Biden's leadership. The Trump administration did not take action against Russia over the Navalny situation. Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote in a separate statement that the sanctions would "send a clear signal" to Russia that the use of chemical weapons and human rights abuses carry hefty consequences. "Any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable and contravenes international norms," Blinken wrote. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied having a role in Navalny's poisoning. A spokesman for Navalny said that the Russian opposition leader's health has deteriorated since his imprisonment. Navalny began a hunger strike in order to force his jailers to provide access to outside medical care for pain in his back and legs. A lawyer for Navalny said he is suffering from two spinal hernias, AP reported .

The prison has declined to allow a doctor of Navalny's choice from outside of the facility to administer his treatment. On Saturday, physician Yaroslav Ashikhmin said that test results he received from Navalny's family show that the jailed critic has elevated levels of potassium, which can trigger a cardiac arrest. Navalny also has heightened creatinine levels that indicate potential kidney failure. "Our patient could die at any moment," Ashikhmin said in a Facebook post . In an interview with the BBC on Sunday, the Russian ambassador to the U.K. accused Navalny of dramatizing his condition in order to attract attention. "Of course he will not be allowed to die in prison, but I can say that Mr. Navalny, he behaves like a hooligan, absolutely," Andrei Kelin said. "His purpose for all of that is to attract attention for him, also by saying that today his left hand is sick and tomorrow his leg is sick and all of that stuff so the journalists pay attention." "Navalny has been treated in the hospital which lies not so far from the place where he is serving his sentence and as I understand, he does not complain anymore," Kelin added. Last week, the Biden administration slapped Russia with a slew of U.S. sanctions for human rights abuses, sweeping cyberattacks and attempts to influence U.S. elections. In an address Thursday, Biden said he was prepared to take further actions against Moscow. "If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I'm prepared to take further actions to respond. It is my responsibility as president of the United States to do so," Biden said from the White House . "I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so, I chose to be proportionate," Biden said of the measures, adding that he did not want to "kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia." Read more: The West waits for Putin's next move as Russia-Ukraine tensions rise Biden also said that he proposed in a phone call with Putin that the two meet in person this summer in Europe to discuss a range of pressing issues. Sullivan told CNN that the Biden-Putin summit was something that was being discussed but would not provide any additional details. "There isn't currently a summit on the books, it's something that we are talking about. That summit would have to take place of course in the right circumstances in a way that could actually move the relationship forward,' Sullivan said.
President Joe Biden and his administration have faced pressure from across the political spectrum to stem the flow of migration at the U.S. southern border. The impact of Hurricanes Eta and Iota is one of many reasons migrants from Central America are making the dangerous journey to the U.S.-Mexico border to seek refuge Climate-related events like the twin hurricanes increasingly intensify drivers of migration, including violence, food insecurity and poverty.	Hurricanes Eta and Iota struck Central America last November, bringing torrential rain, flash floods, landslides and crop damage across Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. An estimated 7.3 million people in the region were affected by the twin hurricanes as of December, according to the United Nations . The impact of the hurricanes is one of many reasons migrants from Central America are making the dangerous journey to the U.S. southern border to seek refuge — and just one example of climate-exacerbated drivers of displacement and migration. "Climate change is reinforcing underlying vulnerabilities and grievances that may have existed for decades, but which are now leading to people having no other choice but to move," Andrew Harper, special advisor on climate action for the UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency, said in an interview. President Joe Biden and his administration have faced pressure from across the political spectrum to stem the flow of migration at the U.S. southern border. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol reported encountering more than 172,000 people attempting to cross the southern border in March, a 71% increase compared with the previous month and a 34% increase from the same time frame in 2019. The vast majority of people arrive at the border are being expelled due to public health ordinance Title 42, although seeking asylum in the U.S. is a legal right. CBP cited "violence, natural disasters, food insecurity, and poverty" in Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador for the rising numbers of encounters at the border. "Climate change is never the sole driving factor behind migration decisions," said Kayly Ober, senior advocate and program manager for the Climate Displacement Program at Refugees International. "We see a confluence of events." Ober said in addition to the sudden-onset disasters like Hurricanes Eta and Iota, longer-term climate challenges like drought contribute to instability, particularly in what's known as the Dry Corridor — a region running along the Pacific coast of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services, told CNBC at least a third of the migrants LIRS works with cite climate-related reasons as a primary factor for their displacement. "You may see migrants who are initially internally displaced due to crop failures. But then because of that initial displacement, they become more vulnerable to gang violence and persecution, which then leads to international migration because the situation becomes worse," Vignarajah said. Sarah Blodgett Bermeo, a professor of public policy and political science at Duke University, recently co-authored a study investigating root causes of migration from Honduras. Using available data from 2012 to 2019, the study found that negative rainfall was associated with greater numbers of Honduran families apprehended at the U.S. southern border. Higher levels of violence, as measured by homicide rates, increased the magnitude of the association even further. "As climate change continues to have impacts around the world, we're going to see more and more of these mixed migration flows, where people are coming for a variety of reasons from the same country," Bermeo said. Meghan López, the International Rescue Committee's regional vice president for Latin America, also highlighted the intersecting factors driving migration. "We cannot say it's violence, we can't say it's climate change, we can't say it's family reunification. It's everything. For any given family, it's a slightly different mix of any of these factors," López said. "People want to get out of the situation they're in, and the next safe stop is the U.S.," López said. "The story is what people are fleeing from, not what they are running to." Harper, the UNHCR's special advisor on climate action, stressed the importance of "forthright, ambitious" action from countries around the world to increase climate adaptability and disaster preparedness in particularly vulnerable regions like Central America. "What we basically need is the mobilization which has occurred for Covid at the global level, but for climate," Harper said. "We cannot continue to push this down and say it's a threat in the future. It's a threat now."
President Biden is facing a tricky path on police reform even as calls from activists mount for his administration to make a priority of tackling racial disparities in law enforcement. The nation's attention is fixed on the issue as a result of the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who has been charged in the death of George Floyd. Biden, who earned a reputation for being tough on crime while in the Senate in the 1990s, faces political and legal headwinds.	President Joe Biden is facing a difficult path on police reform as calls from activists mount for his administration to make a priority of tackling racial disparities in law enforcement. The nation's attention is fixed on the issue amid the trial of Derek Chauvin, the white former Minneapolis police officer who has been charged in the death of George Floyd, whose killing on Memorial Day spurred months of Black Lives Matter protests. A verdict could come as soon as next week. Chauvin's trial came amid a spate of high-profile police killings. During the trial, another Black man, Daunte Wright, was shot and killed by police officer Kimberly Potter in nearby Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, sparking protests . Potter, who claimed that she thought she was using a Taser, has since resigned and been charged with second-degree manslaughter. Protests escalated around the country after footage of the fatal shooting of 13-year-old Adam Toledo by Chicago police Officer Eric Stillman was released last week. Toledo, who was Latino , was killed on March 29. More than three people have died each day at the hands of law enforcement since March 29, according to a tally maintained by The New York Times. Black and Latino people accounted for more than half of those killed during that period, the Times said. Biden, who pledged to overhaul the nation's criminal justice system during his presidential campaign, has in his first months done little to please those hoping for reform. The Democrat, who earned a reputation for being tough on crime while in the Senate in the 1990s, faces political and legal headwinds. At a press conference on Friday, Biden dodged answering a question about whether he would prioritize police reform, instead of focusing on gun violence, which he was also asked about. White House press secretary Jen Psaki declined on Wednesday to say why the administration hadn't taken executive action to recall federal military equipment from local police departments. She said the White House was focusing on what could be done with Congress, specifically via the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The bill, among other things, would prohibit choke holds and no-knock warrants at the federal level, limit them at the state and local level, and restrict the use of qualified immunity, a legal shield for police against civil suits. "I would say this is an issue that will be a cause of President Biden's time in office," Psaki said. "And we are less than 100 days in. There's more to come. Right now, our focus is on working toward getting that legislation passed." Also Wednesday, the administration dropped plans, announced during the campaign, to create a police oversight commission. Susan Rice, director of the Domestic Policy Council, said in a statement first reported by Politico that the commission "would not be the most effective way to deliver on our top priority in this area, which is to sign the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act into law." The administration said civil rights groups and police unions were against the creation of a commission. On the legal front, the role of the federal government in overseeing policing is limited by the Constitution and Supreme Court precedents. While there are fewer than 100 federal law enforcement agencies, there are about 18,000 under state and local control. Congress does have some power to regulate local police agencies in exchange for federal funding and to enforce the 14th Amendment, which prohibits states from depriving "any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." On Friday, Attorney General Merrick Garland reinvigorated one tool the federal government has to oversee local police departments by rescinding a memorandum signed under former President Donald Trump limiting the use of so-called consent decrees. The Justice Department can use the decrees, which must be approved by a court, to force departments that repeatedly violate civil rights to undergo monitoring or other reforms. However, the decrees were rarely used even before Trump significantly curtailed them. A report by the Congressional Research Service found that the Justice Department has historically launched about three pattern-or-practice investigations a year, and only 1 in 3 has led to significant reforms. Advocates and experts have suggested that Biden could pursue some reforms at the federal level that would have an impact more broadly on state and local police departments. In February , two law professors who specialize in policing issues wrote in the Los Angeles Times that Biden could, via executive order, make federal law enforcement agencies a "a model for the rest of the nation" on transparency and accountability by collecting more data and making it available to the public. The professors, Barry Friedman of New York University School of Law and Rachel Harmon of the University of Virginia School of Law, also called on the Biden administration to require local police agencies seeking federal money and equipment to get approval from their local legislature. "A police chief should not be allowed to obtain federal surveillance equipment or armored vehicles without local buy-in," they wrote, adding that Biden could make the move without Congress. Political concerns also stand in the way of meaningful police reform. During the 2020 campaign, Republicans used calls from some progressives to "defund the police" as a political hammer against moderate Democrats. One of Biden's top allies in Congress, Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., said that the slogan hurt his party. Biden has repeatedly said he does not support proposals to reduce police funding, though his administration continues to face blowback from Republicans over the issue. Kristen Clarke, Biden's nominee to oversee the Justice Department's civil rights division, was pressed last week at her confirmation hearing over an opinion article she wrote calling for defunding certain police operations while adding more funding to others. "I do not support defunding the police," Clarke said at the hearing, in an exchange with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Clarke is the president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. The political thorniness of police reform is amplified by the narrow divide in Congress between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats hold a slight majority in the House, where they were able to pass the Justice in Policing Act last month by a 220-212. However, the Senate is evenly divided 50-50. While Vice President Kamala Harris can cast tie-breaking votes, it's still unlikely Democrats would be able to pass the legislation in the upper chamber without significant changes. The bill would likely need 60 votes in the Senate to become law. Republicans last year put forward their own proposal on police reform, which differs in meaningful ways from the legislation introduced by Democrats. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the only Black Republican in the Senate, introduced the Justice Act in June. The Congressional Research Service, which analyzed the differences between the Democratic Justice in Policing Act and the Republican Justice Act, found that they both addressed "certain common issues" like no-knock warrants and choke holds. But, the analysis found, the two bills took different approaches, with the Democratic bill more frequently requiring recipients of federal funding to place restrictions on state and local law enforcement and the Republican bill relying instead on "non-binding measures" and placing more of an emphasis on "gathering data on various law enforcement practices." The American Civil Liberties Union has criticized the Republican bill for not going far enough. In a statement released when the bill was introduced in June, a representative for the group said the legislation "throws billions of dollars at studies and commissions when we know the real problem at the core of American policing — Black people continue to die at the hands of police without consequence."
Prosecutors and the defense make their closing arguments to the jury starting Monday in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, the white former police officer accused of killing George Floyd last May. Arguments come amid a mounting uproar in Minneapolis and elsewhere over police violence against Black men. Jurors will be allowed to deliberate for as long as it takes them to reach a verdict.	Prosecutors and the defense made their closing arguments to the jury on Monday in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, the white former police officer accused of killing George Floyd last May. The anonymous multiracial jury will now be allowed to deliberate for as long as it takes to reach a verdict, which must be unanimous. Arguments came amid a mounting uproar in Minneapolis and elsewhere over police violence against Black men. "You can believe your eyes," prosecutor Jerry Blackwell told jurors. A video of Chauvin with his knee of Floyd's neck formed a central aspect of the prosecution's case. "Why is it necessary to continue applying deadly restraint to a man who is defenseless, who is handcuffed, who is not resisting, who is not breathing, who doesn't have a pulse?" Blackwell added. "It was like he was in a vice. It was like he was being squeezed in a vice," prosecutor Steve Schleicher said.. Schleicher pushed back on arguments, made by the defense, that Floyd died as a result of his underlying health conditions and drug use. "You are not required to believe this amazing coincidence that after this nine minute 29 second constraint" that Floyd "chose that moment to die of heart disease," Schleicher said. Eric Nelson, Chauvin's attorney, began his arguments seeking to get jurors to think broadly about whether Chauvin was acting within the bounds of the law. "The standard is not what should the officer have done in these circumstances. It's not what could the officer have done differently," Nelson said. Nelson said that the standard was what a reasonable officer would do given all of the circumstances facing him or her. "All of the evidence shows that Mr. Chauvin thought he was following his training," Nelson said. "There is absolutely no evidence that officer Chauvin, intentionally, purposefully, applied unlawful force." The case is the most high-profile legal fight involving a white officer who has been accused of killing a Black man to come in recent years. Immediately after arguments concluded, Nelson asked Judge Peter Cahill to grant a mistrial, citing comments made by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. Waters on Saturday urged protesters to "get more confrontational" if the jury reaches a verdict of not guilty. Cahill rejected the motion for a mistrial but said, "I'll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal." "I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law, the judicial branch and our function," Cahill said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki was pressed about the case during a press conference on Monday afternoon. Psaki declined to say whether President Joe Biden would personally be disappointed if Chauvin is found not guilty. The closing arguments put forward two very different versions of what happened on May 25, the day that Floyd died after Chauvin and other Minneapolis police officers attempted to arrest him on suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill. Prosecutors and their expert witnesses have told the jury that Chauvin killed Floyd by cutting off his airway with the police officer's knee while the Black suspect was handcuffed and pinned to the ground for about 9 minutes. During the trial, they made extensive use of video footage recorded by bystanders showing Floyd pleading for his life and telling officers he was unable to breathe. Prosecutors also called Dr. Martin Tobin, a pulmonologist and expert in the science of breathing, who testified that Floyd died from lack of oxygen. "A healthy person subjected to what Mr. Floyd was subjected to would have died," Tobin told jurors. Schleicher relied heavily on Tobin's earlier testimony during his closing arguments. "It was very clear that George Floyd died as a result of a low level of oxygen," he said. The prosecution was led by Matthew Frank, an attorney in the Minnesota attorney general's office. Two other prosecutors, Schleicher and Blackwell, shared the closing arguments. The defense, led by Nelson, argued that Floyd died as a result of high levels of the drug fentanyl that he had ingested prior to his arrest, in addition to his underlying medical problems. An autopsy also found methamphetamine in Floyd's system. Nelson also attempted to paint the crowd of onlookers who were at the scene on May 25 as posing a threat to the arresting officers and making their job more difficult. He has argued that Chauvin's knee may not have been on Floyd's neck, but instead placed on his back. Nelson also highlighted apparent discrepancies between the prosecutors' arguments and the findings of Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County medical examiner, who conducted Floyd's autopsy. Baker ruled that Floyd's death was a homicide but did not find that the cause of his death was asphyxia, or lack of oxygen, as prosecutors claimed. "The law enforcement subdual, restraint and the neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take by virtue of that, those heart conditions," Baker said. Dr. David Fowler, a former chief medical examiner for Maryland called by the defense, testified that carbon monoxide exhaust from a nearby vehicle may also have contributed to his death, in addition to his enlarged heart, high blood pressure and drug use. Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Those charges each require prosecutors to prove that Chauvin was a "substantial causal factor" in Floyd's death. Second-degree murder carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. Third-degree murder has a maximum of 25 years, and the manslaughter charge has a maximum of 10 years. Actual sentences often fall short of statutory maximums. Jurors are instructed that if they have any reasonable doubt about Chauvin's guilt, they must vote not guilty. A unanimous jury is required to convict on any of the counts. The jury has 14 people, including two alternates who may be dismissed before deliberations. The diverse group is made up of two multiracial women, three Black men, a Black woman, six white women, and two white men. The trial comes as tensions are running high. On April 11, as arguments were underway, police officer Kimberly Potter fatally shot Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, during a traffic stop in nearby Brooklyn Center, sparking protests. Potter resigned and claimed she thought she was using a Taser. She has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. -- The Associated Press contributed to this report
President Joe Biden held his second meeting about infrastructure with members of Congress from both parties. Biden's proposal carries a price tag of more than $2 trillion, and Republicans are starting to back a plan that costs roughly a third of that. The president's proposal calls to upgrade transportation, utilities, broadband, housing and job training, but the GOP has taken issue with proposed investments in care for elderly and disabled people and in electric vehicles.	President Joe Biden held his second infrastructure meeting with Democratic and Republican members of Congress on Monday, as GOP lawmakers push to shrink the president's more than $2 trillion plan. Biden aims to approve a package in the coming months that revamps U.S. roads, bridges, airports, broadband, housing and utilities, and invests in job training along with care for elderly and disabled Americans. Republicans have signaled they could support a scaled-back bill based around transportation, broadband and water systems. The president has said he wants to craft a bipartisan bill, but Democrats would move to pass legislation on their own through budget reconciliation if they fail to strike a deal with the GOP. As the parties have disparate visions of what qualifies as infrastructure and how big of a role the government should take in the process, it is unclear what could win support from both Democrats and Republicans. "I am prepared to compromise, prepared to see what we can do, what we get together on," Biden told reporters before Monday's meeting. He said he would talk to lawmakers both about what should go into the plan and how to pay for it. The group included members of Congress who served as governors or mayors, including Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. While Biden has said he wants to forge a compromise with the GOP, the sides stand at least $1 trillion apart. Last week, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., told CNBC that she considers a $600 billion to $800 billion infrastructure plan a "sweet spot" that could win support from both parties. She told reporters Thursday that Republicans expect to outline an infrastructure proposal of their own. Asked Sunday if he would back a roughly $800 billion infrastructure proposal floated by some of his colleagues, Sen. John Cornyn , R-Texas, did not explicitly endorse the figure but signaled he could support a plan with transportation and broadband at its center. "There is a core infrastructure bill that we could pass with appropriate pay-fors like roads, and bridges, and even reaching out to broadband, which this pandemic has exposed a great digital divide in the country. ... I think we could all agree to that, but I think that's the part we can agree on, so let's do it," he said on "Fox News Sunday." Appearing on Fox with Cornyn, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., floated the possibility of Democrats passing a smaller infrastructure proposal with GOP support and then moving to approve their other priorities on their own. Efforts to win Republican support could raise a host of problems for Biden. The GOP wants the president to slash proposed spending on electric vehicles and care for elderly and disabled people — two priorities for Democratic lawmakers. Republicans have also criticized Biden's plans to offset the infrastructure spending. He has called to hike the corporate tax rate to 28%. The GOP cut it to 21% from 35% in 2017, and has resisted efforts to raise the rate again. Agreeing on what counts as infrastructure could trip up talks. Sen. Roger Wicker , a Mississippi Republican who met with Biden last week, said Thursday that he wants to see a bill based around the "30% of the president's proposal that is actually infrastructure." It is unclear how much Biden and congressional Democrats would agree to cut from the plan to win GOP support. Wicker, the ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee, which has broad jurisdiction over transportation and communications issues, said he thinks the infrastructure bill could be bipartisan. "I'm optimistic, I'm hopeful, I'm looking on the bright side," he said. Update: This story was updated to clarify Sen. John Cornyn's comments on a potential infrastructure bill.

MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell announced Monday that his company filed a $1.6 billion lawsuit against Dominion Voting Systems. Dominion is suing MyPillow and Lindell, a loyal supporter of Donald Trump, in a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit. Dominion accuses Lindell of harming the company's reputation by spreading the false claim that it rigged the 2020 election for President Joe Biden.	MyPillow, the bedding company led by the pro-Trump CEO Mike Lindell, on Monday filed a $1.6 billion lawsuit against Dominion Voting Systems, which is currently suing Lindell and his business for defamation. "This is a free-speech case. This is a First Amendment case," Lindell said on a livestreamed broadcast announcing the lawsuit. The election-technology firm Dominion sued MyPillow and Lindell in February , accusing them of spreading the false claim that the company rigged the 2020 election for President Joe Biden by manipulating votes. Former President Donald Trump's campaign and his allies lost dozens of lawsuits in their sweeping effort to overturn key states' election results and flip the outcome of the race. Dominion is seeking more than $1.3 billion in punitive and compensatory damages, saying the "viral disinformation campaign" spread by Lindell and others has "irreparably damaged" the company's reputation. Dominion has filed similar lawsuits against Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, attorney Sidney Powell and Fox News . The new complaint from MyPillow, filed in Minnesota federal court, accuses Dominion of waging an "illegal campaign to punish and silence their critics." MyPillow's lawsuit also makes a distinction between Lindell and his company, arguing, "MyPillow has not engaged in discussion about the 2020 election." "In making these statements, Lindell spoke for himself, not MyPillow," the lawsuit says. Andrew Parker, a lawyer for MyPillow, denied that MyPillow's court action constituted a countersuit against Dominion. But the lawsuit itself says it is being brought "to remedy the grave harm that has been suffered by MyPillow as a result of Dominion's suppression of speech and attacks on the Company." " This is a meritless retaliatory lawsuit, filed by MyPillow to try to distract from the harm it caused to Dominion," said Stephen Shackelford, legal counsel for Dominion, in a statement to CNBC. Dominion has signaled that additional lawsuits could be on the way. Shackelford said last month that the company has not "ruled out any parties, including individual agents of Fox News." MyPillow on Monday morning filed a motion to dismiss Dominion's defamation case.
The U.S. Treasury on Monday named climate change financial advisor John Morton to head the department's new "climate hub,' to foster green finance and use tax policy and financial risk assessments to help reduce carbon emissions. Morton, a partner with Pollination Group, a specialist climate change advisory and investment firm, had served in the Obama administration White House as senior director for energy and climate change on the National Security Council.	The U.S. Treasury on Monday named climate change financial advisor John Morton to head the department's new "climate hub,' to foster green finance and use tax policy and financial risk assessments to help reduce carbon emissions. Morton, a partner with Pollination Group, a specialist climate change advisory and investment firm, had served in the Obama administration White House as senior director for energy and climate change on the National Security Council. He also served in senior positions at the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp and has more than 25 years of experience in emerging markets, investment finance and economic and environmental policy, Treasury said. As the Treasury's 'climate counselor' Morton will report directly to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and advise her on a broad range of climate matters, in particular efforts to facilitate and unlock financing needed for investments to achieve 'net zero' carbon emissions, the Treasury said. "Climate change requires economy-wide investments by industry and government as well as actions to measure and mitigate climate-related risks to households, businesses, and our financial sector," Yellen said in a statement. "Finance and financial incentives will play a crucial role in addressing the climate crisis at home and abroad and in providing capital for opportunities to transform the economy." At Pollination Group, Morton worked with "high ambition" companies that set corporate emission reduction and clean investment targets but didn't have firm plans in place and helped them take concrete steps to match their pledges. In an interview with Reuters earlier this year, Morton said that in order to mobilize more private capital to developing countries to help them transition to a lower-carbon economy, the United States should use its voice and influence through multilateral development banks to prioritize this and investor coalitions should apply more pressure. "What has been lacking in the last four or five years, there has not been top-down pressure from the (previous) administration. The pressure of the bully pulpit appropriately applied can really unlock things," he said. The new Treasury climate czar joins several other high-profile positions within the Biden administration, including a White House climate policy team led by former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy and former Secretary of State John Kerry. Kerry said earlier this month that President Joe Biden plans to issue an executive order that will lead to greater disclosures of financial risks by companies and financial institutions to investors. The Treasury said that in mobilizing financial resources to cut carbon emissions, the new climate hub would prioritize the expedited transition of high-emitting sectors and industries and would leverage tax and economic policies to support building climate resilient infrastructure. The hub also will seek to understand and mitigate the risks that climate change poses to financial system stability and promote globally consistent approaches to assessing those risks, Treasury said.
The Senate will vote Wednesday on a bill that aims to combat a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. The legislation, authored by Sen. Mazie Hirono and Rep. Grace Meng, directs the Justice Department to expedite the review of coronavirus-related hate crimes against Asian Americans and aims to give local law enforcement more resources to respond to the violence. Violence against and harassment of Asian Americans spiked in the last year amid a surge in racist rhetoric directed toward China during the pandemic.	The Senate will vote Wednesday on legislation to address a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday. The bill, put forward by Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, and Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., would instruct the Justice Department to speed up the review of Covid-19 related hate crimes. It also aims to give local law enforcement more support to respond to violence against Asian Americans and curb the use of discriminatory language on the rise since the pandemic started last year. The Senate plans to consider two bipartisan amendments to the bill before a final vote Wednesday, Schumer said. Last week, the chamber voted to start debate on the proposal by a 92-6 margin. "We will vote on the bill on Wednesday. And I dare any senator to vote against this legislation," the Democrat Schumer said at a rally in his home state of New York. "If they do, shame on them, shame on them. Because this is what America is all about. We will pass this legislation, and the bill will address the rise in hate crime." Meng, speaking at the rally with Schumer, said the bill would make it easier for the federal government to track hate incidents "so we can have a more accurate and fuller picture of what's happening." She said "we are finally taking action in Congress" after more than a year of discrimination that has made many Asian Americans wary of leaving their homes or using public transit. The White House has supported the hate crimes bill. In a statement last week, the Office of Management and Budget said the legislation "will stand up for America's values by standing strongly against anti-Asian xenophobia and hate." Anti-Asian hate crimes rose by nearly 150% last year in 16 of the largest U.S. cities, according to a study released last month by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. The spike in violence followed a surge in racist rhetoric about China after Covid-19 spread to the U.S. — including from former President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress. Last month, shootings at Atlanta-area spas left eight people dead, including six women of Asian descent. If the Senate passes the hate crimes bill, the Democratic-held House is expected to follow suit and send it to Biden's desk. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., has endorsed the legislation.

Several key officials have left the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as the nation's biggest business lobbying group shifts its priorities and changes its leadership. At least four of the Chamber's key leaders left in recent months as Republicans criticize the group for backing some Democrats. The group's former top tax lobbyist joined a lobbying shop that focuses specifically on tax legislation.	Several key officials have left the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as the nation's biggest business lobbying group shifts its priorities and changes its leadership during the administration of President Joe Biden . At least four of the group's key leaders left in recent months. The former Chamber executives who have recently departed either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment to CNBC. A Chamber spokesman would not comment on why the leaders mentioned in this story chose to leave. "While the Chamber doesn't comment on specific personnel, we are proud of our talented staff, our record low turnover, and recent new hires," the spokesman said. "Our employees are crucial to serving our members and our mission to create jobs and stimulate economic growth." He noted that the group recently hired former House of Representatives parliamentarian Tom Wickham as senior vice president for state and local policy; Kasper Zeuthen, who led communications strategy on trade and other policy matters at the European Union delegation to the United States, as a vice president; and Denise Osei, from marketing outfit Destination DC, as the group's social media strategist. Still, the timing of the departures coincides with increased Republican criticism of the Chamber as it backs more Democratic lawmakers . The changes also come as the new CEO, Suzanne Clark, takes over for Tom Donohue, who led the organization since the late 1990s. The Chamber also recently lost Charles Schwab as one of its corporate members. Caroline Harris, a leading tax lobbyist for the Chamber, left the group this month, according to her LinkedIn page. She had been at the Chamber for over a decade, her page says. A person with direct knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named in order to speak freely, told CNBC that Harris is joining Capitol Tax Partners, a lobbying shop that focuses on tax legislation. The firm touts that it has worked on every tax bill that has become law over the last 30 years, including former President Donald Trump 's tax reform bill. The firm was paid nearly $12 million in 2020 for its lobbying work, for clients such as Apple, FedEx, Amazon, Citadel, Goldman Sachs and the American Investment Council, according to data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive politics. The managing partner at Capitol Tax Partners did not respond to requests for comment. Another recent departure is Christina Atchley Lotspike. She was a head lobbyist focusing on technology and transportation infrastructure, which is a key priority for the Biden administration. The president is seeking to raise the corporate tax rate to help pay for his $2 trillion infrastructure proposal. Atchley's LinkedIn page says she left the Chamber this month after more than seven years with the group. She is now a lobbyist at grocery shopping app Instacart. Rob Schroder left the Chamber at the start of 2021, according to his LinkedIn page. He was a senior vice president of international affairs. He had also been at the Chamber more than seven years, according to his LinkedIn page. Stan Harrell, who had been the Chamber's chief financial officer, no longer holds that title, according to the group's website. Instead, it lists him as a former senior vice president and CFO. The most recent 990 tax form for the group's foundation from 2019, lists Harrell as the CFO. The form shows that Harrell signed and dated the 990 document in November 2020 as the CFO. His LinkedIn page says he's been at the Chamber for more than 20 years. The Chamber spokesman did not say who is in line to be its next CFO. These moves mark the latest departures from the Chamber of Commerce. Scott Reed, a former senior political strategist at the Chamber, told CNBC last year that he resigned due to the "leftward movement and constant Trump bashing of the Chamber." The group claimed it fired Reed. The departures also come as companies face pushback from GOP leaders for opposing Georgia's new voting law and similar measures being crafted in other states. Critics have said these laws would curb voting access for minorities. While some of the Chamber's members have been vocal about their opposition to these laws, the organization itself has taken a more direct stand against the Democratic-backed For the People Act, which aims to bolster voting access. The group's letter opposing the bill indicates that it is against most of the voting legislation being debated across the nation. "The Chamber is deeply troubled by efforts at the state and federal level to enact election law changes on a partisan basis," it said .
Police officer Brian Sicknick suffered strokes and died of natural causes a day after he grappled with pro-Trump rioters at the Jan. 6 invasion of the U.S. Capitol, Washington's chief medical examiner ruled. The ruling could have a major impact on the efforts to prosecute two men who were charged last month with assaulting Sicknick with a chemical spray. Sicknick's official cause of death was "acute brainstem and cerebellar infarcts due to acute basilar artery thrombosis."	Police officer Brian Sicknick suffered strokes and died of natural causes a day after he grappled with a riotous mob of former President Donald Trump's supporters during the Jan. 6 invasion of the U.S. Capitol, Washington's chief medical examiner said Monday. The finding could make it difficult, if not impossible, to bring murder charges in Sicknick's death. Two men were arrested last month and charged with assaulting the officer with a chemical spray. Sicknick, 42, was "sprayed with a chemical substance outside the U.S. Capitol" during the invasion at about 2:20 p.m., the office of Chief Medical Examiner Francisco Diaz noted in the ruling. At around 10 p.m. that night, Sicknick collapsed at the Capitol and was transported to a hospital, Diaz's office determined. He died there at 9:30 p.m. the following evening. Sicknick's official cause of death was "acute brainstem and cerebellar infarcts due to acute basilar artery thrombosis," according to the medical examiner's office. The officer's manner of death — the circumstances surrounding his passing — was determined to be "natural," the office said. That term is used when a death is caused solely by a disease and is not hastened by an injury. But Diaz in an interview with The Washington Post noted Sicknick's role in confronting the rioters hours before his collapse, saying, "all that transpired played a role in his condition." Still, Diaz told the newspaper that Sicknick's autopsy found no evidence that the officer had an allergic reaction to the chemical irritants sprayed at him during the riot. The Capitol Police said in a press release on the day of Sicknick's death that he "passed away due to injuries sustained while on-duty." In a statement Monday evening to NBC News, the USCP said it accepts the findings from Diaz's office, "but this does not change the fact Officer Brian Sicknick died in the line of duty, courageously defending Congress and the Capitol." "The department continues to mourn the loss of our beloved colleague. The attack on our officers, including Brian, was an attack on our democracy," the USCP said. It added that law enforcement agencies "will continue to ensure those responsible for the assault against officers are held accountable." The medical examiner's ruling on Sicknick's death was viewed as the determining factor in whether homicide charges could be brought in the case of Julian Khater and George Tanios. The two men are accused of assaulting Sicknick and other officers with a substance similar to bear spray. They are not currently charged with killing Sicknick. Michael Sherwin, the federal prosecutor who was leading the investigation of the assault on the Capitol, told CBS News' "60 Minutes" in March that he imagined murder charges would be brought if the medical examiner ruled that the spray played a role in Sicknick's death. "If evidence directly relates that chemical to his death, yeah. We have causation, we have a link. Yes. In that scenario, correct, that's a murder case," Sherwin told CBS.
The Biden administration is taking steps to protect the country's electric system from cyberattacks through a new 100-day initiative combining federal government agencies and private industry. The initiative, announced Tuesday by the Energy Department, encourages owners and operators of power plants and electric utilities to improve their capabilities for identifying cyber threats to their networks.	The Biden administration is taking steps to protect the country's electric system from cyberattacks through a new 100-day initiative combining federal government agencies and private industry. The initiative, announced Tuesday by the Energy Department, encourages owners and operators of power plants and electric utilities to improve their capabilities for identifying cyber threats to their networks. It includes concrete milestones for them to put into use technologies so they can spot and respond to intrusions in real time. The department is soliciting input from electric utilities, energy companies, government agencies and others for recommendations about how to safeguard the energy system supply chain. The effort underscores the heightened concern about the prospects for cyberattacks that disrupt the nation's power supply. Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said in an interview with The Associated Press earlier this month that the administration was undertaking a new effort to help electric utilities, water districts and other critical industries protect against potentially damaging attacks. The U.S. "faces a well-documented and increasing cyber threat from malicious actors seeking to disrupt the electricity Americans rely on to power our homes and businesses," Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants one of her biggest critics to face lawmakers in a hearing next week, but that encounter will have to wait. Warren, a progressive Democrat from Massachusetts, invited billionaire investor Leon Cooperman to testify before a Senate Finance subcommittee hearing. Warren, in a letter to Cooperman obtained by CNBC, called on the financier to attend a hearing set for April 27. Cooperman, in a response given to CNBC, declined the invitation, calling it "self-serving and disingenuous."	Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants one of her biggest critics to face lawmakers in a hearing next week, but that encounter will have to wait. Warren, a progressive Democrat from Massachusetts, invited billionaire investor Leon Cooperman to testify before a Senate Finance subcommittee hearing on taxes. Cooperman, in a response given to CNBC, declined the invitation, calling it "self-serving and disingenuous." "As I have stated many times before (including in my Open Letter to Senator Warren), I believe in a progressive income tax.," Cooperman wrote. "Personally, I am happy to work six months of the year 'for the government' and six months for myself. But many who live in high-tax cities and states already pay even more than the 50 percent combined effective rate that that implies, and at some point, higher effective rates (federal, state, and local combined) become confiscatory, which should never be the ethos of this country." Warren, in a letter to Cooperman first obtained by CNBC , called on the financier to attend a hearing being organized and led by the Finance Committee's Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Growth subcommittee, which she chairs . The hearing, set for April 27, is titled Creating Opportunity Through a Fairer Tax System. Warren told Cooperman in the letter she is interested in giving the longtime Wall Street executive "an opportunity to discuss my Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act, which would level the economic playing field and narrow the racial wealth gap by asking the wealthiest 100,000 households in America, or the top 0.05%, to pay their fair share." The letter was sent to Cooperman on Monday. A rivalry between Warren and Cooperman exploded during the Democrat's campaign for president. After she proposed a wealth tax during the primary, Cooperman blasted her proposal in a letter to the lawmaker . "However much it resonates with your base, your vilification of the rich is misguided, ignoring, among other things, the sources of their wealth and the substantial contributions to society which they already, unprompted by you, make," he said at the time. A month later, Warren's campaign ran a TV ad on CNBC taking aim at Cooperman and other business leaders . Her campaign also sold a mug that read "BILLIONAIRE TEARS" in response to a CNBC interview during which Cooperman cried . Cooperman has since done numerous interviews ripping Warren's tax proposals, including a CNBC appearance in March in which he advised viewers to buy gold if such a bill passes. "If the wealth tax passes, go out and buy yourself some gold because people are going to rush to find ways of hiding their wealth," Cooperman told CNBC at the time. Cooperman expressed skepticism Tuesday about Warren's invitation. "I'm trying to determine whether she's being objective or whether she's just trying to promote her own agenda," Cooperman told CNBC in a statement. "I'm a bit suspicious given how she never responded to the letter I sent her before." Cooperman, who will turn 78 two days before the hearing, is one of the most outspoken members of the investor community. He often speaks of his rags-to-riches story : growing up in the South Bronx as the child of working-class Polish immigrants, attending public schools, and starting his first Wall Street job – with Goldman Sachs – in debt and with zero net worth. After more than two decades with Goldman, Cooperman founded the hedge fund Omega Advisors in 1991. He is now the CEO of the Omega Family Office. Last year, he signed the Giving Pledge, which is a commitment by rich people to donate a majority of their wealth to charity. "That's the American Dream," he said. "I want to give others the opportunity to live the American Dream." Warren addresses Cooperman's issues with her wealth tax idea in the letter sent Monday, encouraging him to discuss his concerns in front of her committee and those watching from home. "But as we move expeditiously toward consideration of changes to our rigged tax code so that the wealthy pay their fair share, I believe you should be afforded the chance to present your perspective directly to Congress," she writes to Cooperman. "The opportunity will allow you to fully air your views, not merely in front of the financial news audience where you often express them, but before the entirety of the American people." Warren and other Democratic lawmakers have pitched a 3% total annual tax on wealth exceeding $1 billion. They have also called for a lesser, 2% annual wealth tax on the net worth of households and trusts ranging from $50 million to $1 billion. Cooperman's net worth is at $2.5 billion, according to Forbes. Here is Cooperman's full letter declining Warren's invite: As you know, I have been invited by Elizabeth Warren to testify at a hearing next Tuesday, to be conducted by the Senate Finance Committee's Subcommittee on Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Growth (which she chairs), entitled "Creating Opportunity Through a Fairer Tax System."   The ostensible purpose of her invitation is to give me an opportunity to express my views about her latest "fair share" legislative proposals – specifically, her Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act.  Since the Senator saw fit to publicize my invitation in the media, I will do the same with this declination. As I have just informed her office, I will not appear at Senator Warren's hearing, for several reasons: In all of this, I am reminded of the words of the noted economist Thomas Sowell: "High tax rates in the upper income brackets allow politicians to win votes with class warfare rhetoric, painting their opponents as defenders of the rich.  Meanwhile, the same politicians can win donations from the rich by creating loopholes that can keep the rich from actually paying those higher taxes – or perhaps any taxes at all.  What is worse than class warfare is phony class warfare.  Slippery talk about 'fairness' is at the heart of this fraud by politicians seeking to squander more of the nation's resources." These, then, are my reasons for respectfully declining Senator Warren's invitation.  I will, however, be sure to tune in for the show. Lee
Chinese President Xi Jinping said his country will not pursue hegemony regardless of how powerful it becomes. Xi also promoted China as a champion for globalization and the multilateral trading system. His remarks came as U.S.-China relations were off to a rough start under the Biden administration.	Chinese President Xi Jinping said Tuesday his country will not pursue hegemony regardless of how powerful it becomes, and he called for a "more fair and equitable" global governance. Beijing has increasingly clashed with the U.S. and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe on issues ranging from human rights to unfair trade practices. Those countries have raised concerns that China's rising political and economic influence is threatening the global order. "However strong it may grow, China will never seek hegemony, expansion or a sphere of influence, nor will China ever engage in an arms race," Xi said at the opening ceremony of the annual Boao Forum for Asia in the Chinese province of Hainan. Xi also claimed, not for the first time, that China is a champion for globalization and the multilateral trading system, saying that international rules should not be set by just one or a few nations. China has itself engaged in unilateral trade sanctions against countries including Australia , after that country voiced support for an international inquiry into China's handling of the coronavirus . The virus first surfaced in China in late 2019. Without naming any countries, Xi said big nations should behave in a manner "befitting their status and with a greater sense of responsibility." He also spoke against a "Cold War" mentality and "ideological confrontation," adding that any country that meddles in others' internal affairs would not get any support. Xi's remarks came as U.S.-China relations are off to a rough start under the administration of President Joe Biden. The United States, United Kingdom, Japan and others have spoken out against China on issues ranging from the autonomy of Hong Kong — a Chinese special administrative region — to allegations of serious human rights violations in western China . Beijing has accused Washington of meddling in its domestic affairs. Last month, Biden said China has "an overall goal to become the leading country, the wealthiest country in the world and the most powerful country in the world." The U.S. president said he will not let that happen under his watch.
Russian President Vladimir Putin gave his annual State of the Nation address Wednesday. The speech came amid reports that Russian troops are massing at the border with Ukraine. Also, Putin critic Alexei Navalny, on hunger strike in a Russian prison, has become dangerously ill and moved to a prison hospital.	Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered his annual State of the Nation address on Wednesday amid growing tensions with Ukraine and a hunger strike by dissident Alexei Navalny. In the last week, there have been further reports that Russian troops are massing at the border with Ukraine, potentially preparing for military action. Navalny, on hunger strike in a Russian prison, has become dangerously ill and has been moved to a prison hospital. The news prompted warnings from the U.S. that there would be "consequences" if Russia allows Navalny to die in jail. In addition, Russia has been accused of orchestrating an attack on a Czech armaments dump in 2014, with the Czech Republic expelling 18 Russian diplomats this week. Russia denies that two of its military intelligence agents — the same men believed to have carried out a nerve agent attack on a former spy in Britain in 2018 — carried out the Czech attack, but the news has nonetheless added to the negative news flow around Putin's Russia. Last week, the U.S. imposed more sanctions on Russia over 2020 election interference, a cyberattack on U.S. government and corporate networks, its annexation and occupation of Ukraine's Crimea, and human rights abuses. The address covered a wide range of topics, from the economy and defense to the environment and taxation. The coronavirus pandemic was on the agenda, too, with the virus hitting the country hard over the past year. Putin has often used the address to make major policy announcements but on Wednesday, he reiterated a warning to the West to not provoke his country, promising a swift retaliation against anyone who crossed "red lines." Moscow will respond "harshly," "quickly" and "asymmetrically" to foreign provocations, he said, according to a Reuters translation. Close watchers of Russia are particularly perplexed by reports that the country has been massing troops at the Ukraine border, with the EU's foreign affairs chief estimating on Tuesday the size of the deployment to be 100,000 troops. "Only last week military analysts were playing down the size of the Russian deployment but it now looks pretty sizeable," Timothy Ash, a senior emerging market strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said in a note Tuesday. "(You've) got to ask yourself why Putin feels the need to put such a large force 'in theatre' as it goes a lot further than sabre rattling. The deployment is bigger than 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and invaded Donbas — let's not forget that. Why bother unless something serious is actually planned?," he asked. Ash questioned what Putin's strategic objectives could be in Ukraine, a country with whom Russia has had tense relations ever since its 2014 annexation of Crimea. "Is that securing water supplies for Crimea, (a) land bridge to Crimea, or giving Ukrainian forces such a beating that the government in Kyiv sues for a peace which gives Russia lasting strategic dominance over Ukraine?," Ash asked. Putin made no mention of Navalny in his speech as protests began, coinciding with the president's address. Two of Navalny's closest allies were arrested Wednesday: Lyubov Sobol, one of the faces of Navalny's popular YouTube channel, and Kira Yarmysh, his spokeswoman, were detained in Moscow, their lawyers said, according to Reuters. Demonstrations were called to take place on Wednesday by Navalny's team in protest at the 44-year-old activist's treatment in prison. Navalny was moved to a prison hospital on Monday as his health deteriorated during a hunger strike he has staged as a protest against his treatment in prison. He has said he has been denied urgent medical treatment, a claim denied by the Russian authorities. Navalny was sentenced him in February to more than two years for parole violations, charges he said were politically motivated. At the weekend, his doctor's warned that Navalny was in danger of a heart attack or kidney failure. The physicians had not been able to visit Navalny in prison but said medical tests provided by his family showed he was dangerously ill and " could die at any moment ." The U.S. administration has warned the Russian government to not let Navalny die in custody, adding that there will be "consequences." Last summer, Navalny was medically evacuated to Germany from a Russian hospital after he was poisoned by a chemical nerve agent. The German government said toxicology reports showed " unequivocal evidence " that Navalny was exposed to a nerve agent which was in the family of Novichok, which was developed by the Soviet Union . Toxicology tests conducted in France and Sweden also came to the same conclusion. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied having a role in Navalny's poisoning. Read more: U.S. disturbed over imprisoned Kremlin critic Navalny's deteriorating health Verisk Maplecroft's Daragh McDowell noted that tensions between Russia and the West have been steadily ratcheting up since the start of the year, driven by the Biden administration's more confrontational policy and the return of Navalny. "Navalny's imprisonment, and the rapid deterioration of his health, has both galvanised Russia's domestic opposition and become an international PR headache for the Kremlin, with European governments under pressure to take a harder line towards Moscow," he said.
The Biden administration on Tuesday formally threw its support behind a long-shot bid from Democrats to make Washington, D.C., the 51st state. Congress should "provide for a swift and orderly transition to statehood" for D.C., the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement of administration policy. The White House's full-throated support for Washington's statehood came days before the House is set to vote on a bill that would put the commonwealth on "equal footing with the other states."	The Biden administration on Tuesday formally threw its support behind a long-shot bid from Democrats to make Washington, D.C., the 51st state. Congress should "provide for a swift and orderly transition to statehood" for the more than 700,000 Washington residents who do not have full voting representation in the House and Senate, the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement of administration policy . The White House's full-throated support for D.C. statehood came days before the House is set to vote on a bill that would put the commonwealth on " equal footing with the other states ." The legislation, H.R. 51 , is expected to pass in the House but is likely to hit roadblocks in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to overcome the filibuster. "The residents of our nation's capital deserve voting representation in Congress and full local self-government," said Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington's Democratic delegate in the House and the bill's sponsor, in a statement applauding the OMB. "With Thursday's House vote and expected passage, along with Democratic control of the Senate and White House, we have never been closer to statehood," she said. Activists have long pushed for Washington to be recognized as a state — with city leaders going so far as to put the protest slogan "Taxation Without Representation" on D.C. license plates — but the issue has historically stayed off the national radar. Now, most Democratic lawmakers back the idea — and they're pushing harder than ever in the wake of the 2020 election cycle, in which the party gained control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. Republicans have broadly balked at the statehood proposal. Some accuse Democrats of attempting to use their current, slim political majorities to cement themselves in power by adding reliably Democratic seats to Congress. "D.C. statehood is a key part of the radical leftist agenda to reshape America, along with the Green New Deal, defunding the police and packing the U.S. Supreme Court," said Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., in a congressional hearing last month . But proponents of statehood, including Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, argue that the issue is one of securing voting rights in a plurality-Black area. President Joe Biden officially revealed his stance last month , when White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that he "believes they deserve representation, that's why he supports D.C. statehood." But Tuesday's statement from the White House budget office fleshes out the administration's views and specifically backs Norton's pending legislation. "For far too long, the more than 700,000 people of Washington, D.C. have been deprived of full representation in the U.S. Congress," the OMB said. "This taxation without representation and denial of self-governance is an affront to the democratic values on which our Nation was founded. H.R. 51 rights this wrong by making Washington, D.C. a state and providing its residents with long overdue full representation in Congress, while maintaining a Federal District that will continue to serve as our Nation's seat of government," the office said. The bill, which boasts more than 200 co-sponsors, passed through the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Wednesday on a party-line vote. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said he plans to bring H.R. 51 to a floor vote on Thursday. "The voice of every American citizen deserves to be heard — it's past time that we make statehood a reality for DC," Hoyer tweeted Friday.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday reiterated his call to legalize marijuana at the federal level, saying he hopes to see an end to the drug's prohibition by next year's 4/20. "Hopefully, the next time this unofficial holiday, 4/20, rolls around, our country will have made progress in addressing the massive overcriminalization of marijuana in a meaningful and comprehensive way," said Schumer.	Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday reiterated his call to legalize marijuana at the federal level, saying he hopes to see an end to the drug's prohibition by next year's 4/20. "Hopefully, the next time this unofficial holiday, 4/20, rolls around, our country will have made progress in addressing the massive overcriminalization of marijuana in a meaningful and comprehensive way," Schumer said on the floor of the upper chamber. Schumer said the nation's war on drugs has "too often been a war on people, particularly people of color." "I believe the time has come to end the federal prohibition on marijuana in this country, and I'm working with Sens. Booker and Wyden on legislation to do just that," he said. In February, Schumer and Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., released a joint statement that also called for restorative justice for people who have been convicted of pot-related crimes. The senators said then that they would release "a unified discussion draft on comprehensive reform" early this year and that passing the legislation will be a priority for the Senate. The draft has yet to be released. The House recently passed legislation that allows banks to work with cannabis companies in states where cannabis is legal, which was seen as a move to allow for more commercial, federal use. That legislation now waits for Senate approval. So far, 15 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for adult recreational use, and 36 states permit medical use of the drug.
Moscow will respond "harshly," "quickly" and "asymmetrically" to foreign provocations, Putin told an audience of Russia's top officials and lawmakers. He added that he "hoped" no foreign actor would cross Russia's "red lines," according to a Reuters translation.	Russian President Vladimir Putin, in his annual State of the Nation speech, warned on Wednesday against provoking his country, promising a swift retaliation against anyone who crossed "red lines." Moscow will respond "harshly," "quickly" and "asymmetrically" to foreign provocations, Putin told an audience of Russia's top officials and lawmakers, adding that he "hoped" no foreign actor would cross Russia's "red lines," according to a Reuters translation. Putin also touted the country's planned investment in expanded military education, hypersonic weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles — while insisting simultaneously that Russia wants peace and arms control agreements. The 68-year-old leader condemned what he described as the constant tendency of international actors to blame Russia for wrongdoing, saying it had become like a sport. The comments came in the final half hour of the 90-minute speech, which was predominantly focused on Russia's fight against the coronavirus pandemic and domestic economic and social issues. The speech came against the backdrop of deteriorating tensions with the U.S. and EU, and follows the recent imposition of sanctions on Russia from the Biden administration over alleged cyberattacks, human rights violations and a Russian military buildup along the border with Ukraine. As the address was taking place, protests have taken place across Russia in support of the jailed Putin critic Alexei Navalny , who has become dangerously ill and has been moved to a prison hospital following a hunger strike. The news prompted warnings from the U.S. that there would be "consequences" if Russia allows Navalny to die in jail. Over 100 people have been detained in the protests so far on Wednesday, according to OVD-Info, an independent Russian NGO that monitors rallies. In addition, Russia has been accused of orchestrating an attack on a Czech armaments dump in 2014, with the Czech Republic expelling 18 Russian diplomats in recent days. Russia denies that two of its military intelligence agents — the same men believed to have carried out a nerve agent attack on a former spy in Britain in 2018 — carried out the Czech attack, but the news has nonetheless added to the negative news flow around Putin's Russia.
The second part of President Joe Biden's infrastructure and economic recovery plan is expected to cost at least $1 trillion and include $500 billion in tax credits. The American Families Plan would extend the strengthened child tax credit through 2025, and is set to expand child care and paid leave. Biden and congressional Democrats will face challenges in passing one or both pieces of the recovery plan, which together amount to trillions more in spending. Republicans have opposed a corporate tax hike contained in the first piece of the infrastructure plan and will likely resist individual tax increases expected to be in the second part.	President Joe Biden 's next economic recovery package will cost at least $1 trillion and extend the beefed-up child tax credit, a source familiar with the proposal confirmed Tuesday. Biden is set to follow the first phase of his infrastructure plan, a more than $2 trillion proposal, with a package known as the American Families Plan. While details are still in flux, the measure is expected to include roughly $1 trillion in new spending and $500 billion in tax credits, according to the source, who declined to be named. The White House is expected to roll out the plan within days. Biden's American Jobs Plan, which congressional Democrats have started to craft, calls to revamp roads, bridges, airports, broadband, utilities, housing and job training. The second piece is expected to expand child care, paid leave, pre-K education and tax credits for families, while raising taxes on the wealthy. Those policies are priorities for progressives, who have said they want to address shortcomings in the social safety net exposed by the coronavirus pandemic , which disproportionately affect women in the labor market. It would extend the strengthened child tax credit — which Democrats' coronavirus relief bill raised to as much as $3,600 per child per year — through 2025 but not make it permanent, CNBC confirmed. The Biden administration will likely move to offset the costs by hiking taxes on the wealthiest Americans, and is considering options including raising the top income tax rate to the pre-2017 level of 39.6% and taxing capital gains as ordinary income. The Washington Post first reported details of the proposal. In a statement, White House spokesman Michael Gwin said "President Biden has already put forward the first part of his historic plan to invest in the strength of America's economy and families, and he'll be outlining the second element of that proposal in the coming days." "The details of that package are still being finalized, so speculation as to its final contents is premature at this point," he said. After passage of its $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan last month, the White House moved on to its next priority in the infrastructure plans. Democrats face challenges in passing one or both parts of the recovery proposal. The appetite for more spending among Republicans has shrunk since Biden took office. While the president has said he wants to strike an infrastructure deal with his GOP counterparts, Republican lawmakers have shown little desire to spend more than $800 billion — about a third of the price tag of Biden's first proposal. The GOP has opposed Biden's push to hike the corporate tax rate to 28% as part of the initial infrastructure plan. Many Republican lawmakers will likely resist individual tax increases as part of the second phase, as well. Some Democrats in Congress have floated the idea of working with Republicans to pass a smaller infrastructure bill based around transportation and broadband, then moving to pass child care, paid leave and education provisions on their own through budget reconciliation. — CNBC's Thomas Franck contributed to this report.

A jury on Tuesday found former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin guilty on all three charges, including second-degree murder, stemming from the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, last year. Jurors reached the verdict on their second day of deliberations. Video of Chauvin holding his knee on or near Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes last May, while Floyd was prone and handcuffed, spurred months of protests and reanimated the movement opposing police brutality against Black men.	A jury on Tuesday found former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin guilty on all three charges stemming from the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, last year. Chauvin was not expressive as Judge Peter Cahill announced his conviction on charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The verdicts were read a day after jurors began their deliberations. Video of Chauvin holding his knee on or near Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes last May, while Floyd was prone and handcuffed, spurred months of protests and reanimated the movement opposing police brutality against Black men. Second-degree murder carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. Third-degree murder has a maximum penalty of 25 years. Second-degree manslaughter has a maximum of 10 years. Sentencing guidelines call for sentences short of the maximum. Cahill said that sentencing would take place in eight weeks. After the verdicts were read, Chauvin was handcuffed and escorted out of the courtroom. "This case is a turning point in American history for accountability of law enforcement and sends a clear message we hope is heard clearly in every city and every state," Ben Crump, an attorney for Floyd's family, said in a statement. President Joe Biden , in a phone call with Floyd's family that Crump recorded and posted online, pledged to accomplish meaningful police reform and told them that "nothing is going to make it all better, but at least now there's some justice." Vice President Kamala Harris, who was also on the phone call, said: "We are going to make something good come out of this tragedy." Chauvin's high-profile trial began in March and concluded on Monday in a Minneapolis courthouse fortified with barbed wire. The case has been at the forefront of the anti-racist movement that gained steam during former President Donald Trump's term in office and ignited around the country in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. The video of Floyd's death became a vivid illustration to many of the way Black men are often treated at the hands of law enforcement. Whether Chauvin was found guilty or acquitted was widely seen as a test of America's system of justice. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who oversaw the prosecution, said at a press conference that "George Floyd mattered. He was loved by his family and his friends." "He mattered because he was a human being, and there is no way you can turn away from that reality," Ellison said. He said that the verdict is not justice in itself, but that it is "accountability, which is the first step toward justice." After it was announced that the jury would deliver its verdict on Tuesday afternoon, Biden canceled planned remarks on an infrastructure proposal he is attempting to pass in Congress. He was expected to address the verdict later Tuesday. Top Democrats in Congress cheered the decision. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement that the "guilty verdict serves as an official proclamation of what so many of us have known for nearly a year: George Floyd was murdered by an officer who was sworn to protect and serve." "However, we should not mistake a guilty verdict in this case as evidence that the persistent problem of police misconduct has been solved or that the divide between law enforcement and so many of the communities they serve has been bridged," Schumer said. "We must remain diligent in our efforts to bring meaningful change to police departments across the country." Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama said in a joint statement, "Today, a jury did the right thing. But true justice requires much more." "True justice requires that we come to terms with the fact that Black Americans are treated differently, every day," the Obamas said. "It requires us to recognize that millions of our friends, family, and fellow citizens live in fear that their next encounter with law enforcement could be their last." People who were close to Floyd braced themselves for potential outcomes earlier Tuesday. "I think it will mean change; it will mean change. It's a first step in a long road to recovery," Floyd's girlfriend, Courteney Batya Ross, said in an interview on CNN on Tuesday, addressing a potential guilty verdict. "I believe Floyd came here for a reason," she said. After the verdict was read, celebrations erupted at the courthouse and at the Cup Foods where Floyd was killed. A trial for three of the other officers involved in Floyd's arrest, Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng, and Tou Thao, is set to begin in August. Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, earlier indicated that his client would appeal a guilty verdict on the basis that jurors may have been impermissibly swayed by outside forces. Nelson cited comments by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who urged protesters to become confrontational if the jury acquitted Chauvin. Biden , who has pledged to overhaul the nation's criminal justice system, refrained from providing his views on the case while it was ongoing. On Tuesday, while jurors were sequestered, he said that he prayed that the jury would come to the "right verdict ." The tense atmosphere surrounding the trial was amplified in recent weeks by a spate of police killings that have led to protests. On April 11, Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, was killed by a police officer in nearby Brooklyn Center, Minnesota. The officer, Kimberly Potter, later claimed that she thought she was using a Taser. Potter has resigned and been charged with second-degree manslaughter. Adam Toledo, a Latino 13-year-old, was shot and killed by a Chicago police officer on March 29. Footage of the seventh grader's killing, which fueled anguish in Chicago and around the country, was released amid Chauvin's trial. This is breaking news. Check back for updates.
Thousands of supporters of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny marched in central Moscow on Wednesday as part of nationwide demonstrations calling for his freedom as his health reportedly is in severe decline while on a hunger strike. More than 1,000 people were arrested across the country in connection with the protests, according to a human rights group that monitors political repression. Navalny's team called for the unsanctioned demonstrations after weekend reports that his health is deteriorating.	Thousands of supporters of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny marched in central Moscow on Wednesday as part of nationwide demonstrations calling for his freedom as his health reportedly is in severe decline while on a hunger strike. More than 1,000 people were arrested across the country in connection with the protests, according to a human rights group that monitors political repression. Many were seized before the protests even began, including two top Navalny associates in Moscow. Navalny's team called for the unsanctioned demonstrations after weekend reports that his health is deteriorating. "The situation with Alexei is indeed critical, and so we moved up the day of the mass protests," Vladimir Ashurkov, a close Navalny ally and executive director of the Foundation for Fighting Corruption, told The Associated Press. "Alexei's health has sharply deteriorated, and he is in a rather critical condition. Doctors are saying that judging by his test (results), he should be admitted into intensive care." Navalny's organization called for the Moscow protesters to assemble on Manezh Square, just outside the Kremlin walls, but police blocked it off. Instead, a large crowd gathered at the nearby Russian State Library and another lined Tverskaya Street, a main avenue that leads to the square. Both groups then moved through the streets. "How can you not come out if a person is being murdered — and not just him. There are so many political prisoners," said Nina Skvortsova, a Moscow protester. In St. Petersburg, police blocked off Palace Square, the vast space outside the Hermitage museum and protesters instead crowded along nearby Nevsky Prospekt. It was unclear if the demonstrations would match the size and intensity of nationwide protests that broke out in January after Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent, was arrested. Turnout estimates varied widely: Moscow police said 6,000 people demonstrated in the capital, while an observer told Navalny's YouTube channel that the crowd was about 60,000. The OVD-Info group reported 1,004 arrests in 82 cities. Navalny's team called the nationwide protests for the same day that Putin gave his annual state-of-the-nation address. In his speech, he denounced foreign governments' alleged attempts to impose their will on Russia. Putin, who never publicly uses Navalny's name, did not specify to whom the denunciation referred, but Western governments have been harshly critical of Navalny's treatment and have called for his release. In Moscow, Navalny spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh and Lyubov Sobol, one of his most prominent associates, were detained by police in the morning. Yarmysh, who was put under house arrest after the January protests, was detained outside her apartment building when she went out during the one hour she is allowed to leave, said her lawyer, Veronika Polyakova. She was taken to a police station and charged with organizing an illegal gathering. Sobol was removed from a taxi by uniformed police, said her lawyer, Vladimir Voronin. OVD-Info reported that police searched the offices of Navalny's organization in Yekaterinbrug and detained a Navalny-affiliated journalist in Khabarovsk. In St. Petersburg, the State University of Aerospace Instrumentation posted a notice warning that students participating in unauthorized demonstrations could be expelled. Soon after, a court found that Navalny's long stay in Germany violated the terms of a suspended sentence he was handed for a 2014 embezzlement conviction and ordered him to serve 2 1/2 years in prison . Navalny began the hunger strike to protest prison officials' refusal to let his doctors visit when he began experiencing severe back pain and a loss of feeling in his legs. The penitentiary service has said Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs. Navalny's physician, Dr. Yaroslav Ashikhmin, said recently that test results he received from Navalny's family showed sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, and heightened creatinine levels that indicate impaired kidneys and he "could die at any moment." On Sunday, he was transferred to a hospital in another prison and given a glucose drip. Prison officials rebuffed attempts by his doctors to visit him there. Russian authorities have escalated their crackdown on Navalny's allies and supporters. The Moscow prosecutor's office asking a court to brand Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption and his network of regional offices as extremist organizations. Human rights activists say such a move would paralyze the activities of the groups and expose their members and donors to prison sentences of up to 10 years. Navalny's allies vowed to continue their work despite the pressure. "It is, of course, an element of escalation," Ashurkov told the AP. "But I have to say we were able to regroup and organize our work despite the pressure before. I'm confident that now, too, we will find ways to work...We have neither the intention nor the possibility to abandon what we're doing."
"We believe Mr. Navalny's life is in serious danger," U.N. human rights experts wrote in a Wednesday statement. Russian authorities had previously said that they offered Navalny medical care but that he continued to refuse it. Confrontation over Navalny's imprisonment and worsening health condition is the latest drumbeat in the already tense relations between Moscow and the West.	WASHINGTON – United Nations human rights experts called for the immediate medical evacuation of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny from Russia, citing concerns over his deteriorating health and prison conditions that they say may amount to torture. "We believe Mr. Navalny's life is in serious danger," the group wrote in a statement Wednesday . "We are deeply troubled that Mr. Navalny is being kept in conditions that could amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in a facility that reportedly does not meet international standards," the statement added. "We urge the Russian authorities to ensure Mr. Navalny has access to his own doctors and to allow him to be evacuated for urgent medical treatment abroad, as they did in August 2020. We reiterate that the Russian Government is accountable for Mr. Navalny's life and health while he is in detention," the group added. A Russian court in February sentenced Navalny to more than two years in jail for parole violations, charges he said were politically motivated. His detention came after spending nearly half a year in Germany recovering from a nerve agent poisoning that took place last August. Moscow has denied any role in Navalny's poisoning. On the heels of his arrest and subsequent detention, the West called on the Kremlin for Navalny's immediate release. Navalny, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin 's most vocal critics in recent years, was transferred to a prison hospital on April 19 , three weeks into a hunger strike protesting against his treatment in prison and denial of urgent medical treatment. Russian authorities had previously said that they offered Navalny medical care but that he continued to refuse it. The prison had declined to allow a doctor of Navalny's choice from outside of the facility to administer his treatment. On Sunday, White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan said the Biden administration warned the Russian government to not let Navalny die in custody. "We have communicated to the Russian government that what happens to Mr. Navalny in their custody is their responsibility and they will be held accountable by the international community," Sullivan said on CNN's "State of the Union" program. "We have communicated that there will be consequences if Mr. Navalny dies," he added. Confrontation over Navalny's imprisonment and worsening health condition is the latest drumbeat in the already tense relations between Moscow and the West. In an annual address on Wednesday, Putin warned countries of crossing Russia's " red lines " as international pressure mounts over a massive military buildup on the border with Ukraine. In March, the United States sanctioned seven members of the Russian government for the alleged poisoning and subsequent detention of Navalny. The sanctions were the first to target Moscow under U.S. President Joe Biden 's leadership. The Trump administration did not take action against Russia over the Navalny situation. Last week, the Biden administration slapped Russia with another round of U.S. sanctions for human rights abuses, sweeping cyberattacks and attempts to influence U.S. elections. In an address announcing the new measures, Biden said he was prepared to take further action against Moscow. "If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I'm prepared to take further actions to respond. It is my responsibility as president of the United States to do so," Biden said from the White House . Washington also expelled 10 officials from Russia's diplomatic mission in the United States.
Hometown International, a mysterious $100 million company that owns just one tiny New Jersey deli, is linked in multiple ways to another odd company, E-Waste. E-Waste's stock, like that of deli owner Hometown International, has soared in the past year, also giving it market capitalization of more than $100 million earlier this month. E-Waste CEO John Rollo recently had a job that is unusual for the head of a company that on paper is worth tens of millions of dollars: a patient transporter at a northern New Jersey hospital. Peter Coker Sr., a North Carolina businessman, is connected to both companies. Coker son Peter Jr. is chairman of the deli company, whose CEO is high school principal and wrestling coach Paul Morina.	We'll have what they're having. A mysterious $100 million company that owns just one tiny New Jersey deli is linked in multiple ways to another odd company, E-Waste Corp. E-Waste's stock, like that of deli owner Hometown International , has soared in the past year, also giving it market capitalization of more than $100 million earlier this month. This surge happened despite E-Waste having no significant ongoing business, records show. Filings also indicate that Hometown International lent E-Waste $150,000 late last year. The deli was closed for more than five months last year due to the Covid pandemic. And like Hometown International's CEO, who is a New Jersey high school principal and head wrestling coach, E-Waste CEO John Rollo recently had a job that is unusual for the head of a company that on paper is worth tens of millions of dollars. He was a patient transporter at a northern New Jersey hospital and still apparently works in the same health-care system. The E-Waste CEO's career history is full of other surprising detours. Rollo, 66, who did not return a call seeking comment, previously won two Grammy awards during his extensive career as a recording engineer and producer on albums by artists such as The Kinks, Joe Cocker, Whitney Houston, Kool & the Gang and Quiet Riot, according to records. He also spent nearly 18 years as vice president for operations at Comus International, a New Jersey-based switching and sensor manufacturer. Rollo was fired from Comus in 2019, according to a lawsuit he filed that year in connection with his termination. The connections between E-Waste and Hometown International — whose Your Hometown Deli in Paulsboro had combined sales of only about $35,000 in the past two years — include the same Hong Kong entity being their biggest shareholders, similar consulting contracts with companies controlled by investors and their current use of the same New York law firm. And, just like early financial filings by Hometown International , E-Waste's initial regulatory filings show the involvement of a lawyer who later was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly involvement in fraudulent schemes involving the creation of companies. The lawyer for E-Waste was a different one from the one initially used by Hometown International — Hometown's previous lawyer, unlike E-Waste's, was charged and convicted of related federal crimes. Another similarity between the companies is the fact that no one associated with them has returned calls or emails from CNBC. A key figure involved in both companies is Peter Coker Sr., a 78-year-old North Carolina businessman whose son, Peter Coker Jr., is chairman of Hometown International. The younger Coker is executive chairman of South Shore Holdings Ltd., a Hong Kong company that owns a financially troubled hotel in Macau, China: The 13. That uber-luxurious property's initial investors included Steve Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors, Fidelity International, and Omega Advisors.  The 13's website indicates it has been closed since Feb. 15, 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Records show that Coker Sr. is an investor in Hometown International, as is a company of his, Europa Capital. The largest shareholders in Hometown International include three separate entities in Hong Kong, which all share the same address, and four separate entities in Macau, which likewise all have the same address there. Paul Morina, the deli owner's CEO and the principal and wrestling coach for Paulsboro High School, is also a major shareholder in Hometown. E-Waste, which has described itself as a shell company in Securities and Exchange Commission filings, had total assets valued at almost $183,000 and liabilities of almost $412,400 as of November, according to its most recent 10-Q filing with the SEC. The company had a net loss of almost $58,000 for the nine months ended Nov. 30. The company was incorporated in 2012 in Florida "to develop an e-waste recycling business" but "was not successful in its efforts and discontinued that line of business," according to SEC filings. Since then, the company has been a shell company and is looking to "engage in a business combination with a private entity whose business presents an opportunity for its shareholders," the filing says. That filing also says there is substantial doubt that E-Waste will be able to stay in business over the next year, noting that the company "has incurred significant losses since its inception and has not demonstrated an ability to generate sufficient revenues" to become profitable. "There can be no assurance that profitable operations will ever be achieved, or if achieved, could be sustained on a continuing basis," the filing says. "If the Company does not obtain additional capital, the Company will be required to reduce the scope of its business development activities or cease operations." Despite that extremely dire outlook, E-Waste's stock is doing quite well. The stock, which appears to have started trading last July at 2 cents per share — with shares selling for well below $1 apiece for weeks after that — has sharply risen since then. Last week, the stock, of which there are 10 million common shares outstanding, hit a high of $10.25 per share. It gave the company a $100.25 million market capitalization. E-Waste closed at $8.26 per share, down 17.4%, on Wednesday, giving it an $82.6 million market cap. On April 12, E-Waste entered into what it called a "subscription agreement ... with three 'accredited investors '"  who bought 2.5 million units of the company's securities at a price of $1 per unit, giving it $2.5 million, according to a company filing with the SEC. Each unit consists of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase two more shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share. E-Waste said in its filing that it plans to use proceeds from the sale of the units for "working capital, general corporate purposes, and to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, engage in a business combination with a private entity whose business represents an opportunity for our shareholders." The stock of E-Waste and Hometown International traded on the over-the-counter market. Trading volume in both companies for the past year has been, as a rule, very thin. Late Wednesday, Hometown International was delisted from the OTCQB over-the counter market "for not complying with the rules" and slapped with a warning label for would-be buyers, according to a tweet by OTC Markets Group CEO Cromwell Coulson. Volume in Hometown International shares had spiked on the heels of a mocking mention of the company's valuation in a letter last Thursday to clients from hedge-fund manager David Einhorn, who quipped, "The pastrami must be amazing." Hometown International's stock rose from $3.25 per share in late March 2020 — when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down its deli for more than five months — to up to $14 per share earlier this month. E-Waste's own surge in the stock market came after a big change in ownership and management at the company, which before fall 2020 was registered at a firm on Park Avenue in Manhattan, GEM Group. As of early last year, four of the five biggest shareholders of E-Waste were, in order of size of shares held: the Valletta, Malta-based GEM Global Yield Fund LLC SCS, and three individuals whose address was that of something called GEM Advisors, located on Madison Avenue in New York. At the time, E-Waste's president, treasurer and secretary was a man named Peter de Svastich, who is a managing director at the GEM Group. When CNBC called de Svastich on Wednesday, he snapped, "I don't know who you are, and I don't speak to reporters" — before hanging up the phone. GEM, which had been E-Waste's controlling shareholder, sold 6 million restricted shares of the company's stock last year for $30,000 to Global Equity Limited — a Macau, China-based entity. Global Equity Limited is the biggest single shareholder in Hometown International, the deli owner whose chairman is Coker Jr. De Svastich resigned as part of that sale agreement of E-Waste shares to Global Equity Limited — and Rollo, the music producer and patient transporter, took over as the sole executive at E-Waste. E-Waste's registration and phone number also changed to Coker Sr.'s office in Carrboro, North Carolina. The company entered into a one-year lease for the office there at a monthly rate of $250, the company said in its SEC filing. In the same month, E-Waste received a $255,000 loan from Coker Sr., according to the filing, which says the interest on that loan is 8% annually. E-Waste pays Coker Sr.'s firm Tryon Capital $2,500 a month in consulting fees, according to an SEC filing. Hometown International also pays Tryon Capital a monthly consulting fee: $15,000. That deal means Hometown pays more in consulting fees over three months than its underlying deli business made in sales over the past two years. In late November, E-Waste issued a promissory note to Hometown International for $150,000, a filing says, indicating that Hometown made a loan in that amount to the other company. The interest rate on that debt to Hometown is listed both at 8% and 6% in the filing, in an apparent typo. The note was signed by Rollo and it was signed as accepted by Morina, the president and CEO of Hometown International. Morina, 62, is the principal of Paulsboro High School, which is near the deli that Hometown International owns. He is also head coach of the Philadelphia-area school's renowned wrestling team, which has frequently won state championships under his leadership . Morina's 1.5 million common shares of Hometown International are worth, on paper, at least more than $19 million. He has warrants for 30 million more shares, which theoretically are worth nearly $400 million at Hometown International's current stock price. The promissory note to Hometown International from E-Waste gave the deli owner's corporate address as a residence in Woodstown, New Jersey, which is the home of Christine Lindenmuth. Lindenmuth is vice president and secretary of Hometown International. She also is a math teacher and administrator at Paulsboro High School. An SEC filing says Rollo has served as a patient transporter for New Jersey-based Atlantic Health Systems since March 2020. A supervisor in the office of patient transportation at one of that company's facilities, Morristown Medical Center, told CNBC that Rollo had previously worked in that department but currently is working elsewhere in Atlantic Health Systems. CNBC has contacted spokesmen for Atlantic Health to ask where Rollo currently works. SEC filings by E-Waste say that Rollo, from January 2010 to November 2019, also "Served as Chairman of the Board for Switching Technologies Gunther, LTD ('STG') in Chennai, India," a company listed on the BSE, formerly known as the Bombay Stock Exchange. That time frame overlaps with Rollo's work at Comus, which bills itself as one of the leading makers of switches. Records show that Rollo is CEO of another company, Med Spa Vacations, whose mailing address is also Coker Sr.'s Carrboro office. SEC filings by Med Spa Vacations show that its shareholders include Global Equity Limited. Global Equity Limited also holds 2 million shares of Hometown International's common stock, which it bought from Peter Coker Jr., the company's chairman, in April 2020, according to filings. Global Equity Limited has warrants for another 40 million shares of Hometown International. The owners of Global Equity Limited are listed as two people, Michael Tyldesley and Ibrahima Thiam. Filings by Med Spa Vacations say that Tyldesley and Thiam "beneficially own 90% and 10%, respectively, in Global Equity Limited and have joint voting and investment power over the shares directly owned by Global Equity Limited." Tyldesley also is listed as the managing director of VCH Limited, another Macau entity, which owns 500,000 common shares of Hometown International and has warrants for another 10 million shares. Last May, filings show, Hometown International entered into a consulting agreement with VCH Limited, which is being paid $25,000 per month from the deli owner. That monthly payment is just about $10,000 less in total sales than Hometown International's deli sold in Italian hoagies, cheesesteaks and french fries in the past two years. CNBC has previously detailed Peter Coker Sr.'s tangled history , which includes allegations of hiding money from creditors and civil allegations of fraud , all of which he denied. Coker Sr. reportedly was arrested in 1992 — the same year he was embroiled in a lawsuit by American Express Bank for unpaid debts — on charges of prostitution, corruption of minors and open lewdness in connection with an incident in which police said he had exposed himself to children in his native Allentown, Pennsylvania . Coker Sr. is also business partners in North Carolina with Peter Reichard, who a decade ago was convicted of using their firm, Tryon Capital, as an ostensible party in bogus consulting deals to obscure illegal campaign donations to Bev Perdue, a Democrat who was elected governor of North Carolina in 2008. Coker Sr. was not criminally charged in that case. Reichard is the son of Ram Dass, the late spiritual and LSD guru who gained renown in the 1960s and 1970s.
President Joe Biden announced a tax credit for employers offering Covid vaccine-related paid leave. The tax credit for small- and medium-sized business will fully offset the cost of giving employees paid time off to get inoculated and recover from side effects, administration officials told reporters. Biden in a speech touted that the U.S. is set to hit 200 million Covid shots administered since he took office.	President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced a tax credit for employers offering vaccine-related paid leave as the White House urges more Americans to seek out Covid shots amid a slight decline in vaccinations. The tax credit for small- and medium-sized businesses will fully offset the cost of giving employees paid time off to get inoculated, as well as to recover from any potential side effects of vaccination, the White House said . The Biden administration is also calling on employers to use their resources to encourage vaccinations by sharing accurate information and providing possible incentives, such as product giveaways and discounts for vaccinated people. "Every employee should get paid leave to get a shot, and businesses should know that they can provide it without a hit to their bottom line," Biden said in a speech at the White House. "There's no excuse for not getting it done." The tax credit, part of the $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus plan Biden signed into law last month, applies to nearly half of all private sector employees, according to the White House. For businesses and nonprofits with fewer than 500 employees, the tax credit will cover paid leave for up to $511 per day per employee for up to 10 workdays, or 80 work hours, taken between April 1 and Sept. 30, 2021. Biden announced the tax credit after touting the fact that the U.S. is set to hit 200 million Covid shots administered since he took office. The president said that if the pace of vaccinations had stayed the same as it was when he took over from former President Donald Trump, it would have taken 220 days to reach the same milestone. "It's an incredible achievement," Biden said, but "we still have some work to do with our target groups." The president urged everyone 16 years and older to seek out a Covid vaccine. "If you've been waiting your turn, wait no longer," Biden said. "Now is the time." The president had originally aimed to achieve 100 million shots in 100 days — a goal that drew criticism for being far too modest. The Biden administration surpassed that number in 58 days. About 26% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Health experts have signaled the percentage required to reach so-called herd immunity is much higher. But the vaccination rate has dipped slightly in recent days, despite every U.S. adult becoming eligible for a Covid shot as of this week. The U.S. is reporting an average of 3 million daily vaccinations over the past week, according to CDC data, up from about 1.8 million at the beginning of March. That level has fallen slightly in recent days, down from a peak of 3.4 million reported shots per day on April 13 to just more than 3 million Tuesday. The slight dip in the daily pace may be due in part to the ongoing investigation into Johnson & Johnson 's vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration earlier this month advised states to suspend the use of J&J's shot "out of an abundance of caution" after six women developed a rare blood clotting disorder. Though the J&J vaccine makes up less than 4% of the 213 million total vaccines administered in the U.S. to date, it was being used for an average of nearly 425,000 reported shots per day at peak levels in mid-April. Unlike offerings from Pfizer and Moderna, J&J's vaccine required only one dose, making it ideal for certain communities that may have more difficulty accessing vaccination sites multiple times over the course of several weeks. Government officials have said the country has enough supply of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to maintain a pace of 3 million shots per day. The Biden administration has maintained a sense of urgency around vaccinations, stressing that Covid remains a serious threat — especially as highly contagious variants spread through the U.S. "It's almost a race between getting people vaccinated and this surge that seems to want to increase," top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said earlier this month.
Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday announced that the Department of Justice will investigate the practices of the Minneapolis Police Department. The announcement comes one day after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted by a jury of the murder of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, who was killed in custody last year.	Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday announced that the Department of Justice is launching an investigation into the practices of the Minneapolis Police Department. "The investigation I am announcing today will assess whether the Minneapolis Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force, including during protests," Garland said during a news conference. The announcement came one day after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted by a jury of the murder of George Floyd , an unarmed Black man, who was killed in custody last year. Video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd for more than nine minutes while the handcuffed man struggled to breathe sparked protests around the country. Garland said the investigation will also examine whether the department's treatment of individuals with behavioral health disabilities is lawful. He said the DOJ had already begun outreach to the local community. "Yesterday's verdict in the state criminal trial does not address potentially systemic policing issues in Minneapolis," Garland said. Watch live: Merrick Garland announces investigation into Minneapolis police department The Justice Department probe is known as a pattern-or-practice investigation. The DOJ had earlier announced a separate investigation into whether Chauvin violated Floyd's civil rights. During his remarks, Garland emphasized that he believed that the majority of the nation's police officers did their best to uphold the law. "I strongly believe that good officers do not want to work in systems that allow bad practices. Good officers welcome accountability, because accountability is an essential part of building trust with the community, and public safety requires public trust," Garland said. Pattern-or-practice investigations, the Justice Department has said , often examine "whether the police department has engaged in a pattern or practice of stops, searches, or arrests that violate the Fourth Amendment; use of excessive force; discriminatory policing; violation of the constitutional rights of criminal suspects; or violation of First Amendment rights." If the DOJ concludes that a police department has systematically violated the law, it can pursue a settlement, often known as a consent decree, which sometimes entails independent monitoring or other reforms. The agreement must be approved by a court. Garland earlier this month rescinded a memorandum signed during former President Donald Trump 's term that limited the use of consent decrees. "The Department of Justice will be unwavering in its pursuit of equal justice under law," Garland said. "The challenges we face are deeply woven into our history. They did not arise today or last year. Building trust between community and law enforcement will take time and effort by all of us, but we undertake this task with determination and urgency knowing that change cannot wait," Garland added. In a statement issued after Chauvin's guilty verdict was announced, Garland said that while "the state's prosecution was successful, I know that nothing can fill the void that the loved ones of George Floyd have felt since his death." Garland said in the statement that the previously announced civil rights investigation was "ongoing." President Joe Biden pledged after Chauvin was convicted that he would push forward on reforming the nation's policing. The verdict "can be a giant step forward," Biden said. "We can't stop here." House Democrats have passed police reform legislation named after Floyd. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act was approved in the House of Representatives by a vote of 220-212 but has not yet received a vote in the Senate, where it is considered unlikely to pass. The bill would limit the use of controversial police tactics like chokeholds and no-knock warrants, and restrict federal qualified immunity, a legal shield that protects officers from civil suits and has been criticized for providing impunity to those who use excessive force. Chauvin was convicted of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Judge Peter Cahill said that he will be sentenced in eight weeks. Chauvin faces a potential sentence of several decades in prison. Garland said that the pattern-or-practice investigation will be staffed by the Justice Department's civil rights division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota.
Jeff Ricchetti, the brother of longtime Biden advisor and White House counselor Steve Ricchetti, started lobbying the Executive Office of the President in the first quarter, according to new disclosure reports. The reports show Jeff Ricchetti's lobbying activity on behalf of several health-care companies took place from January through the end of March. In a rare statement, Jeff Ricchetti told CNBC that he has not lobbied his brother. He also did not provide details on his recent efforts engaging with the Biden administration.	The brother of one of President Joe Biden's leading advisors started lobbying the White House earlier this year on behalf of several prominent health-care companies as the administration began its efforts to combat the Covid pandemic. Jeff Ricchetti, the brother of longtime Biden advisor and White House counselor Steve Ricchetti, started lobbying the Executive Office of the President in the first quarter, according to new disclosure reports reviewed by CNBC. The lobbying disclosures show that Jeff Ricchetti lobbied the EOP for health-care giants GlaxoSmithKline, Horizon Therapeutics and Vaxart Inc. His efforts for these firms came as the Biden administration ramped up efforts to combat the Covid pandemic with a vaccination blitz and other initiatives. Jeff Ricchetti's lobbying activity took place from January through the end of March, according to the documents. Biden was inaugurated Jan. 20. Jeff Ricchetti started working for the health-care companies before Election Day in November. After Biden won the 2020 election, ethics experts told CNBC that Steve Ricchetti could be forced to recuse himself from certain issues pertaining to his brother's lobbying business. In a rare statement, Jeff Ricchetti told CNBC that he has not lobbied his brother. He also did not provide details on his recent efforts engaging with the Biden administration. "I do not lobby my brother and I have not even mentioned to him the names of clients that I currently represent," Jeff Ricchetti said in an email Wednesday. "For the better part of the last thirty years I have lobbied Members of Congress and their staff, and various individuals who have served in the successive Administrations. It is what I do for a living." The EOP includes several advisory groups for the president, including the Council of Economic Advisors, the National Security Council and the Office of Management and Budget. He lobbied the EOP for his corporate clients on a wide range of topics, including on issues pertaining to a Covid-19 antibody treatment. Records indicate that Jeff Ricchetti did not lobby the EOP under former President Donald Trump. Records suggest that the last time Jeff Ricchetti lobbied the EOP was in 2000 during Bill Clinton's administration. At that time, Ricchetti was working for the Podesta Group, which was co-founded by longtime political advisors John and Tony Podesta . John Podesta, at the time, was Clinton's chief of staff. CNBC asked the White House a litany of questions on Ricchetti's effort to lobby the influential office, including queries on who he spoke with. A White House official responded to CNBC's inquiry only by stating that "Steve Ricchetti does not and has not had conversations with Jeff Ricchetti relating to his business representations on any matter." The official also pointed to a wide range of ethics experts that praised Biden's ethics pledge, including Norman Eisen , a key ethics advisor for Obama and his team. Biden's ethics pledge calls for the president's appointees not to be involved with any issues linked to their previous employer or former clients, including lobbyists coming into the administration who recently worked in the influence industry. Steve and Jeff Ricchetti co-founded the lobbying firm Ricchetti Inc. Steve Ricchetti has not been registered to lobby for over a decade. Ethics experts told CNBC that it's concerning to see Jeff Ricchetti engaging with the EOP while his brother advises Biden. Walter Shaub, the former director of the Office of Government Ethics under Obama and, for a short period of time, under Trump , compared the Ricchetti brothers' situation to an instance from the Trump years. "This is reminiscent of Matt Schlapp lobbying the Executive Office of the President while his wife worked there . It's concerning," Shaub told CNBC, referring to former Trump White House communications strategist Mercedes Schlapp. "There's no escaping that lobbying the EOP while your relative works there creates the appearance of peddling influence." Steve Ricchetti reportedly has a broad portfolio in his White House role, including acting as a liaison to business leaders and discussing Biden's infrastructure priorities with moderate lawmakers . Jeff Ricchetti's business has picked up a great deal during the early days of the Biden administration. The Center for Responsive Politics notes that his firm brought in $820,000 in the first quarter of 2021, nearly five times more than he earned in the first quarter last year. GlaxoSmithKline paid the firm $60,000 in the first quarter. He engaged with the EOP, along with members of Congress, on a wide range of health-care issues, including those linked to what's described on the form as "Covid-19 antibody treatment approval." The company did not elaborate on the specifics of Jeff Ricchetti's lobbying efforts. "GSK has always worked with policymakers of both political parties to ensure our voice is heard on important policy issues that affect our industry and the patients we serve. We hired Ricchetti Inc. based on their long history of working with centrist Democrats on tax and health policy issues," Lyndsay Meyer, a spokeswoman for the pharmaceutical firm, told CNBC. GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology announced their submission to the Food and Drug Administration for an emergency authorization use for their Covid antibody treatment at the end of March. Horizon Therapeutics paid Ricchetti $80,000 in the first quarter. He went on to lobby the EOP, Congress and the Department of Health and Human Services on their behalf, including on "issues related to drug pricing and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement," the quarterly document says. A spokesman for Horizon declined to comment for this story. Vaxart paid Ricchetti $80,000 in the first quarter. He lobbied the EOP, Congress and Health and Human Services on "legislative and regulatory policies regarding oral vaccine development and funding," the filing says. "The urgent effort to develop a COVID-19 vaccine has focused on injectables and many policymakers don't know that the Holy Grail is an oral tablet — an oral tablet is easier to distribute, administer, and is stable at room temperature, unlike injectables," a company spokesman told CNBC. "It also overcomes needle-phobia that many Americans suffer from. We have asked Mr. Ricchetti to help us educate policy makers about the oral tablet option." The company declined to comment further on the matter. Another recent lobbying report says Jeff Ricchetti lobbied the office for natural gas company TC Energy. He registered to lobby for TC Energy in January, just before Biden was inaugurated. TC Energy paid Ricchetti $90,000 to lobby in the first quarter. The lobbying disclosure form said he focused on the EOP on "legislative issues affecting energy infrastructure, the safe and efficient transportation of natural gas and liquids energy, renewable electricity policy, and alternative fuel sources like renewable natural gas and hydrogen." Despite what the filing says, the company denied that Jeff Ricchetti is lobbying the White House on its behalf. "Jeff Ricchetti is part of a diverse team of advisors who provide strategic advice and counsel to our company on a wide range of energy issues. Jeff's work on our behalf is limited to lobbying Members of Congress. He does not lobby the White House on our behalf," Marc Palazzo, TC Energy vice president of U.S. stakeholder relations, said in a statement. The company did not respond to follow-up requests for comment about what the lobbying disclosure report says.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Tina Smith and Marco Rubio reintroduced two pieces of legislation that aim to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign suppliers for pharmaceuticals and ingredients. The Food and Drug Administration estimates that 80% of the manufacturers that produce ingredients for drugs are located outside the U.S., many in China and India. The U.S. faced shortages for drugs used to treat Covid-19 patients during the pandemic as demand surged but supply was disrupted due to factory closures and shipping delays.	Sens Elizabeth Warren, Tina Smith and Marco Rubio reintroduced two pieces of legislation on Thursday to secure the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain by reducing dependence on China and other nations for the supplies needed to make life-saving drugs and vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration estimates that 80% of the manufacturers that produce ingredients for drugs are located outside the U.S. , many in China and India. While the agency has been closely monitoring the supply chain, it does not have a clear understanding of where drug components are made. The U.S. faced shortages for drugs used to treat Covid-19 patients during the pandemic as demand surged but supply was disrupted due to factory closures and shipping delays. "To defeat the current COVID-19 crisis and better equip the United States against future pandemics, we must boost our country's manufacturing capacity,"  Warren, D-Mass., said. "Our bill will end our overreliance on foreign countries and give us the tools we need to produce the critical drugs that millions of Americans depend on here at home." Warren and Smith, D-Minn., first introduced the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Defense and Enhancement Act in June 2020. The bill requires the Food and Drug Administration commissioner and the secretary of Defense to develop a confidential list of "critical drugs," provides $5 billion for investments in domestic production and requires drugmakers to report the source of their materials to the FDA. Senators Warren and Rubio, R-Fla., are also re-upping legislation first introduced last year to direct the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Treasury to conduct a study through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. "COVID-19 has made it painfully clear that we must pass meaningful legislation in order to help rebuild our nation's medical manufacturing and pharmaceutical sector," Rubio said. The bill aims to understand how foreign direct investment from abroad affects the nation's ability to produce drugs, as well as U.S. genome sequencing and DNA storage. President Joe Biden's American Jobs Act calls for $30 billion in investments to protect Americans from future pandemics, which includes efforts to bring back pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing to the U.S. Lawmakers worry that foreign manufacturers could restrict or even completely cut off the supply of critical drug components as geopolitical tensions rise. Bad actors could tamper with drugs to make them ineffective or weaponize them.
The House passed a bill that would make Washington, D.C., the nation's 51st state. The proposal is backed by President Biden and top Democrats but faces daunting odds in the Senate, so long as the legislative filibuster remains in place. Advocates call the bill a long-overdue equal-rights milestone, but critics decry it as a political power grab.	The House on Thursday passed a bill that would make Washington, D.C., the nation's 51st state, a prospect that advocates call a long-overdue equal-rights milestone and critics decry as a naked power grab. The bill passed in a 216-208 vote along party lines. The proposal, backed by President Joe Biden and leaders in both chambers of Congress, was all but guaranteed to pass through the Democrat-led House. But it nevertheless faces daunting odds in the Senate, so long as the legislative filibuster remains in place. The final vote came after more than 90 minutes of strident debate on the House floor, in which Democrats argued that granting full federal representation to Washington residents is a moral imperative. "The House will finally address this unjust, unequal and undemocratic situation," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told the chamber. Arizona Republican Rep. Andy Biggs responded that the legislation is really about "Democratic partisanship, Democrat power, Democrat policy, Democrat progressive issues." Members of each party accused the other of pursuing a "power grab." "It is outrageous that Republicans would play partisan politics just to block 712,000 Americans from having full equality in our democracy," said House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. The proceedings were briefly derailed when Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y., accused House Republicans of pushing "racist trash" in the statehood debate. "One Senate Republican said that D.C. wouldn't be a quote, well-rounded working-class state," said Jones. "I had no idea there were so many syllables in the word white." The comments immediately spurred howls of protest on the chamber floor. Jones agreed to withdraw his language from the record. Thursday's bill would create a new state with two senators and one representative. Once considered a fringe cause pushed by area locals, the vast majority of Democratic lawmakers are now on the record in support of statehood for the nation's capital. "This taxation without representation and denial of self-governance is an affront to the democratic values on which our Nation was founded," Biden's Office of Management and Budget said Tuesday in an official statement of administration policy . Advocates for statehood also frame the issue in terms of racial justice and civil rights . Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, for instance, argued in a House hearing last month that the city's historically large Black population factored into the denial of voting rights for its residents. "We know well the grave injustices our nation was built on," Bowser said in a statement Thursday after the vote passed. "We also know that progress has been made time and time again because elected leaders and everyday citizens had the courage and vision to demand a more inclusive democracy." The bill, sponsored by Washington Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, boasts 216 co-sponsors, all of whom are Democrats. The new state would encompass all of the District of Columbia, except for the strip of land on which the White House, the Capital building, the Supreme Court and the national mall are located. A prior version, H.R. 51 , passed through the House in last year's Congress, marking the first time that either chamber had approved a bid for D.C. statehood. But that legislation stalled in the Senate, led at the time by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who refused to bring it to a vote. In the wake of the 2020 election, Democrats gained a razor-thin majority in the Senate. The body is now split 50-50 between the two parties, with Vice President Kamala Harris wielding the tie-breaking vote. But the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to pass most legislation, would likely thwart any attempt to pass the statehood bill in the Senate by a simple majority. Additionally, a handful of moderate Democratic senators, including Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema, have yet to signal how they would vote. The bill is also highly unlikely to find support from Republicans, who accuse Democrats of trying to ensconce themselves in power through brute force. Washington is one of the most liberal cities in the nation. If it became a state, Washington would add two reliably Democratic seats to the Senate, making it exponentially harder for the GOP to win back majority control. With the face of the U.S. political map on the table, critics balk at Democrats' insistence that their motivations are of principle and not politics. "San Francisco will never vote Republican but will do so before D.C. does," conservative columnist George Will said in The Washington Post on Wednesday. "Does anyone believe that if D.C. were as incorrigibly Republican as it is Democratic, Democrats would favor D.C. statehood, which would mean two more Republican senators until the last trumpet shall sound?" Many Republican lawmakers have voiced their opposition more bluntly. Statehood "is nothing more than an unconstitutional power grab by Democrats to gain two ultra-progressive D.C Senate seats [and] enforce radical, far-left policies on the American people," Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Pa., said on the House floor. Others have asserted that Washington's small size and arguable lack of diverse industry disqualify it from statehood. Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., argued at last month's hearing on the bill that D.C. "would be the only state, the only state, without an airport, without a car dealership, without a capital city, without a landfill." Democrats and fact-checkers pointed out the district does have car dealerships. No Republican senators have indicated they would support making the district a state. Some opponents, however, have proposed an alternative in the form of retrocession, which would have the neighboring state of Maryland absorb most of Washington. Democrats oppose that idea. Norton said in February that retrocession "would be inconsistent" with Washington's "pursuit of self-determination." "D.C. statehood does not require a constitutional amendment," Norton added, responding to another complaint about the statehood bill. "Under the Constitution, Congress has the authority to admit new states, and every new state has been admitted by Congress." With Republicans dead set on retaking Congress in 2022 and with the filibuster likely standing in the way of huge chunks of the Democratic agenda, a growing chorus within the party is calling for the 60-vote rule to be abolished or reformed. "There are no provisions in the Constitution about a filibuster," House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said in an interview published Wednesday in the Washingtonian about the statehood bill. "So, frankly, I think that filibuster rule ought to be eliminated in the United States so that democracy can prevail," Hoyer said. But Manchin has vowed to oppose any efforts to scrap or weaken the filibuster, setting back Democrats' hopes to pass huge agenda items through Congress without Republican votes.
Reducing carbon emissions is one of the few areas China and the U.S. have said they could cooperate on, and aligns with Xi's announcement last year that the Asian nation aims to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030. "We must be committed to multilateralism," Xi said as his fifth point in his brief remarks, of which an official translation from the Chinese was streamed online by the White House.	BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping called Thursday for countries to work together, while respecting their different responsibilities on reducing carbon emissions. Xi made the remarks at a U.S.-led climate summit. The Chinese leader's roughly five-minute remarks via video conference were the first from the leader of a single country, following opening remarks from U.S. President Joe Biden and his administration. The U.N. secretary general also spoke at the event. Biden invited 40 global leaders to the two-day summit, which is set to conclude Friday. Reducing carbon emissions is one of the few areas China and the U.S. have said they could cooperate on. It also aligns with Xi's announcement last year that the Asian nation aims to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030. The two countries are the world's largest carbon emitters. "We must be committed to multilateralism," Xi said as his fifth point in his brief remarks, of which an official translation from the Chinese was streamed online by the White House. Xi's sixth point was commitment "to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities." He said developed countries should increase their ambitions on addressing climate issues, while helping less-developed nations speed up their shift to low carbon growth. The Chinese leader then pointed to a joint statement the U.S. and China released over the weekend on how the two countries would work together to "tackle the climate crisis." The statement followed two days of talks in Shanghai between U.S. special envoy for climate John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua. "China looks forward to working with the international community, including the United States, to jointly advance global environmental governance," Xi said. Since taking office in January, Biden has called China the "most serious competitor" to the U.S. as he maintains former President Donald Trump's tough stance on Beijing. Xi and Biden spoke by phone in February, just ahead of China's Spring Festival. On Thursday, Xi said China would "strictly control coal-fired generation projects" and limit increases in coal consumption over the next five years, with a phase down in the following five years. New energy vehicles and "green" transportation will be an important next area for communication and cooperation between the U.S. and China, special envoy Xie said at a press conference following Xi's remarks. He said while China leads in new energy vehicles, the U.S. has lots of good tech and there's a need to discuss for more cooperation in technology.
Leaders of countries like Brazil, Japan and Canada made commitments on Thursday to curb greenhouse gas emissions during President Joe Biden's climate summit. The pledges by U.S. allies and adversaries come shortly after Biden vowed to reduce U.S. emissions by at least 50% by 2030. The president convened the summit in an effort to urge global cooperation on climate change. "We're really beginning to make some real progress," Biden told leaders during the summit.	Leaders of countries like Brazil, Canada and Japan made commitments on Thursday to curb domestic greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change during President Joe Biden 's climate summit. The pledges come shortly after Biden vowed to reduce U.S. emissions by at least 50% by 2030 , more than doubling the country's prior commitment under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The president convened the summit to urge global cooperation on climate change. "It's an encouraging start," Biden told world leaders during the summit. "We're really beginning to make some real progress." In a split from his past attitude toward climate change, Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro vowed to end illegal deforestation in the country by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Bolsonaro has previously criticized protections of the country's forests and threatened to withdraw from the Paris accord. Brazil has asked the Biden administration to provide $1 billion to pay for conservation efforts in the Amazon rainforest. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the country will pledge to curb emissions by 46% by 2030 compared with 2013 levels. Japan, the world's fifth largest emitter, previously committed to a 26% reduction, a goal that was criticized as insufficient. "Japan is ready to demonstrate its leadership for worldwide decarbonization," Suga said at the summit. Like the U.S., Japan has pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed that Canada will slash emissions 40% to 45% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels, a major increase from its previous pledge of 30%. "We will continually strengthen our plan and take even more actions on our journey to net zero by 2050," Trudeau said during the summit. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi didn't provide a new target but re-confirmed the country's vow to install 450 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030. Modi also announced an India-U.S. Climate and Clean Energy Agenda Partnership for 2030. India is the world's third largest emitter behind China and the U.S. Russia President Vladimir Putin broadly pledged to "significantly" reduce the country's emissions in the next three decades and said Russia makes a big contribution in absorbing global carbon dioxide. Putin also said the country has nearly halved its emissions compared to 1990 and called for a global reduction of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide and a main driver of climate change. "The fate of our entire planet, the development prospects of each country, the well-being and quality of life of people largely depend on the success of these efforts," Putin said at the summit. China's President Xi Jinping re-affirmed commitments to peak emissions before 2030 and go carbon neutral by 2060. The U.S. and China have agreed to cooperate on climate change despite division on issues like trade and human rights. South Korea President Moon Jae In said that Korea will end public financing of coal-fired power plants overseas and plans to unveil a stronger emissions reduction pledge. Some countries praised Biden for hosting the summit and bringing the U.S. back into the Paris accord. Former President Donald Trump 's administration exited the agreement and halted all federal efforts to reduce emissions. "I'm delighted to see that the United States is back to work together with us in climate politics, because there can be no doubt about the world needing your contribution," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at the summit. Nations under the Paris agreement are set to unveil updated emissions targets for the next decade at the U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, in November.
The Senate approved a bill Thursday that aims to curb a rise in hate crimes targeting Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic. The legislation would direct the Justice Department to expedite review of hate crimes related to Covid-19 and offer state and local law enforcement more resources to track the incidents.	The Senate passed a bill Thursday designed to curb a spike in hate crimes targeting Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic. The chamber approved the measure in a 94-1 vote, with Republican Josh Hawley of Missouri the only senator to oppose it. The legislation will head to the Democratic-held House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., has backed the bill, and President Joe Biden has signaled he would sign it into law. The proposal would instruct the Justice Department to expedite the review of hate crimes related to Covid-19. It also would give state and local law enforcement more resources to track the incidents and send guidance on how to root out discriminatory language used to describe the pandemic. "The AAPI community is being targeted for hate crimes and other incidents and the Congress needs to stand up to condemn these kinds of actions," Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat and co-author of the bill, told CNBC on Wednesday ahead of its passage. The bill passed with nearly unanimous support in the Democratic-held Senate after approval of bipartisan amendments. The legislation marks the most concrete action Congress has taken to respond to a rise in violence and harassment directed toward Asian Americans since the pandemic started last year. It followed an increase in racist rhetoric directed toward China over the origins of the virus — including from former President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. Anti-Asian hate crimes jumped by about 150% last year in 16 of the largest U.S. cities, according to a study released last month by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Hirono, who wrote the bill with Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., has spoken about her own fear of violence. Earlier this month, she said she no longer feels comfortable walking while listening to an audiobook on her headphones. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Thursday the climate crisis is making it more difficult for the military to defend the U.S. and its allies. Austin said the nation's 18 intelligence agencies are slated to produce a report focused on the security implications of climate change. He spoke at a summit with world leaders focused on climate change, where President Joe Biden pledge to cut emissions by 50% to 52% by 2030.	WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Thursday described the climate crisis as one of the nation's existential threats with the potential to profoundly destabilize global security. "From coast to coast and across the world, the climate crisis has caused substantial damage and put people in danger, making it more difficult for us to carry out our mission of defending the United States and our allies," Austin said in an address at a summit with world leaders focused on climate change. "As the Arctic melts, competition for resources and influence in the region increases. Closer to the equator, rising temperatures and more frequent and intense extreme weather events in Africa and Central America threaten millions with drought, hunger and displacement," the Pentagon chief added. President Joe Biden kicked off the virtual summit, which falls on the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement signing and Earth Day, with a pledge to cut emissions by 50% to 52% by 2030 . The new target more than doubles the Obama administration's prior commitment under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Former President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the accords in 2019. "I welcome President Biden's leadership on tackling climate change," NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in his opening remarks at the summit. "Global warming is making the world more dangerous. It has a serious impact on our security, so it matters for NATO," he said, adding that NATO members would be stepping up efforts to address the climate crisis. In his remarks, Austin gave a few examples of extreme weather caused by climate change that directly impacted the U.S. military and its installations. In 2018, Hurricane Michael inflicted 'catastrophic' damage to Tyndall Air Force Base after ripping through the Florida Panhandle. Austin said the destruction to the base, which is home to the nation's 325th Fighter Wing, cost billions of dollars. In 2019, severe flooding of the Missouri River damaged more than 130 buildings at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska. The installation, home to U.S. Strategic Command and the 55th Wing, has required hundreds of millions of dollars for reconstruction efforts. "Wildfires in California have threatened other military installations, forcing repeated evacuations. Typhoons in Guam most commonly occur from June to December, but in February 2019, Typhoon Wutip forced us to pause exercises with our Australian and Japanese allies," Austin explained. Austin said the nation's 18 intelligence agencies are slated to produce a report focused on the security implications of climate change.
U.S. Marine Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said Thursday he is concerned that the Afghan military will collapse after U.S. and other foreign troops leave. On April 14, President Joe Biden announced he will withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, ending America's longest war. "My concern is the ability of the Afghan military to hold the ground that they're on now without the support that they've been used to for many years," McKenzie told the Senate Armed Services committee at a hearing.	WASHINGTON — The head of U.S. forces in the Middle East said Thursday he is concerned that the Afghan military will collapse after U.S. and foreign troops leave the war-torn country. Marine Gen. Kenneth McKenzie's remarks come on the heels of President Joe Biden's April 14 announcement that he will withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, ending America's longest war. "I am concerned about the ability of the Afghan military to hold on after we leave, the ability of the Afghan Air Force to fly, in particular, after we remove the support for those aircraft," McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said during a Senate Armed Services committee hearing Thursday. Afghan forces, he said, have gotten used to the support from U.S. and other nations' militaries over several years. Later at the Pentagon, McKenzie said Biden consulted with him and other top military brass before the commander-in-chief made the call to pull the troops. "The president went out of the way to ensure all views were on the table," he said. "I think we all recognize there were risks ahead that fall as a result of that decision. But I would reject the assertion that we're out of step." A White House representative referred CNBC's request for comment on McKenzie's remarks to the National Security Council. An NSC spokesperson cited recent comments by deputy national security advisor Jonathan Finer, who said the administration isn't under any illusions about how difficult the situation will be after U.S. forces leave Afghanistan. McKenzie also told reporters that while the U.S. will continue to support Afghanistan from afar, he was particularly concerned about aircraft maintenance. The machines are maintained largely by contractors from the U.S. and other nations, he said. The U.S. intends to find innovative ways of replacing these services in a way that wouldn't involve boots on the ground, he added. When asked about the trillions of dollars that had been invested in training and assisting the Afghan military, McKenzie said he believed the U.S. had seen a "good return on our investment." The wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria have cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1.57 trillion collectively since Sept. 11, 2001, according to a Defense Department report . More than 2,000 U.S. service members have died in Afghanistan. The removal of approximately 3,000 American service members coincides with the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which spurred the U.S.' entry into lengthy wars in the Middle East and Central Asia. "It is time to end America's longest war. It is time for American troops to come home," Biden said in his televised address from the White House Treaty Room, where former President George W. Bush announced military action against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in October 2001. Biden's withdrawal timeline breaks with a proposed deadline brokered last year by the Trump administration with the Taliban . According to the deal, by May 1, 2021, all foreign forces would leave Afghanistan.
The $100 million company that owns a New Jersey deli was delisted from an over-the-counter market platform because of public disclosure "irregularities." OTC Markets Group executives told CNBC that they are now examining the filings of a second firm — E-Waste — a shell company that has multiple ties to deli owner Hometown International. OTC Markets officials would not say whether they have contacted the Securities and Exchange Commission about their concerns with Hometown International.	The $100 million company that owns a New Jersey deli was delisted from an over-the-counter market platform because of public disclosure "irregularities," according to the firm that booted that the mysterious delicatessen operator. OTC Markets Group executives also told CNBC on Thursday that they are now examining the filings of a second firm — E-Waste — a shell company that has multiple ties to deli owner Hometown International . Like Hometown International, E-Waste has an incredibly high market capitalization despite having little if any significant business operations. Hometown International's market capitalization has topped $100 million despite owning only a Paulsboro, New Jersey, deli, which had sales of less than $37,000 combined in the past two years. Hometown International, which trades under the symbol HWIN, had a "buyer beware" label slapped on it Wednesday night when OTC Markets Group relegated it to Pink, a less prestigious over-the-counter platform. OTC Markets CEO Cromwell Coulson said in a tweet Wednesday that Hometown International's demotion and warning label were due to "public interest concerns" – and for "not complying with the rules." OTC Markets officials on Thursday would not say whether they have contacted the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates publicly traded companies, about their concerns with Hometown International. But OTC Markets general counsel Dan Zinn noted that every suspension or action the firm takes against one of the 11,000 companies that trade on its over-the-counter market platforms is "all publicly available, so the SEC and FINRA [the regulator of broker-dealers] has access to all of these." "Frequently, we have a lot of back-and-forth with the SEC," Zinn said in an interview. "We do it a lot, and we do it typically behind the scenes." The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC. Hometown International officials did not return requests for comment. Until Wednesday night, Hometown International had been listed on the OTCQB market, the trading platform designated as "The Venture Market" by OTC Markets Group. Hometown International was demoted to Pink, or "The Open Market." It is where stocks go if they do not qualify for OTCQB or OTCQX, which is labeled "The Best Market" under OTC Markets. Hometown International drew scrutiny from OTC Markets after hedge fund manager David Einhorn mentioned the company as a cautionary example to retail investors , given its extremely high valuation without significant sales at the deli. "The pastrami must be amazing," Einhorn cracked about the shop, which is located across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. Indeed, the deli has won raves for its Sicilian and Italian hoagies from several curious customers, including Pete Genovese , a food critic at New Jersey's Star-Ledger newspaper. There's no pastrami on the menu, however. Einhorn also had noted that the company's CEO is a high school principal, Paul Morina , who also is the head coach of Paulsboro's extremely successful high school wrestling team. OTC Markets' interest in Hometown International was further fueled by CNBC articles detailing regulatory sanctions against the firm's accountants , first lawyer and a former broker connected to the father of the company's chairman. Those articles also detailed criminal convictions of people connected to the firm, and legal issues surrounding the father of the chairman. Jason Paltrowitz, executive vice president for corporate services at OTC Markets, said that "the simple thing, that it's a deli trading at an obscene valuation" is not the reason the company was delisted. "However, what concerned us here were the things that were being publicly disclosed," Paltrowitz added. "There were irregularities in what was out in the public domain ... if you dug deeper into the filings." "It wasn't simply that it was a highly valued deli. That stuff happens," he said. "But that did cause the review." Asked about the nature of the irregularities OTC Markets discovered in Hometown International's paperwork, Zinn said, "We're not going to get hyper-specific about any one company." OTC Markets said Hometown International may not reapply to be listed again on OTCQB for at least 90 days. "The Caveat Emptor designation will remain until OTC Markets Group believes there is no longer a public interest concern," OTC Markets said. That designation includes a "skull-and-crossbones" icon next to a stock's trading symbol "to inform investors that there may be reason to exercise additional care and perform thorough due diligence before making an investment decision in that security," the company's policy says. Hours before OTC Markets delisted Hometown International from the OTCQB, an article by CNBC detailed E-Waste's connections to the deli owner. The stock of E-Waste, which is being traded on the Pink market, is priced at more than $8 per share, giving the company a market capitalization of more than $80 million despite not having any ongoing business. Like Hometown International, E-Waste's stock has as a rule traded in very small share amounts each day compared with the millions of shares each company has outstanding. SEC filings indicate that Hometown International loaned E-Waste $150,000 late last year. Global Equity Ltd., a Hong Kong entity, is the biggest shareholder of both firms. Each company also has consulting agreements with a North Carolina company run by Peter Coker Sr., the father of Hometown International's chairman. The companies also use the same New York law firm for filings. Coker Sr.'s office in North Carolina is used as a mailing address for E-Waste. E-Waste's CEO is John Rollo, a Grammy-winning recording engineer and producer, and former operations vice president of a New Jersey switching and sensor manufacturer. He more recently has worked as a patient transporter at a northern New Jersey hospital. Rollo has not returned requests for comment. Neither has Coker Sr. OTC Markets' Paltrowitz said that there is no "caveat emptor" label on E-Waste. But he also said the firm's status on the Pink market is "being reviewed." It trades under the ticker symbol EWST. Zinn said that OTC Markets has limited power over the stocks on its exchanges beyond relegating them to less-prestigious markets or slapping them with a warning label. "We don't have that power to say that symbol is revoked," Zinn said. Only the SEC has that power, he added.
Biden will seek to raise taxes on millionaire investors to fund education and other spending priorities as part of an effort to overhaul the U.S. economy. Biden will seek an increase in the tax on capital gains to 39.6% for those Americans earning more than $1 million, according to reports. Reports said the president is expected to release the proposal formally next week as a way to fund spending in the upcoming American Families Plan.	President Joe Biden will seek to raise taxes on millionaire investors to fund education and other spending priorities as part of the administration's effort to overhaul the U.S. economy. As part of the plan, Biden will seek an increase in the tax on capital gains to 39.6% from 20% for those Americans earning more than $1 million, according to multiple outlets, including Bloomberg News and The New York Times. The capital gains tax is especially important to Wall Street since it dictates how large a chunk of an equity sale is collected by the federal government. The White House declined to comment. Stocks slid on news about the plan, with the S&P 500 Index down 1% as of 2:14 p.m. after climbing 0.2% earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite both retreated by a similar magnitude. The proposal would make good on Biden's campaign promise to require America's wealthiest households to contribute more as a percentage of their income. This plan would bring the capital gains tax rate and the top individual income tax rate, currently at 37%, to near parity. Reports said the president is expected to release the proposal formally next week as a way to fund spending in the upcoming American Families Plan, expected to come in around $1 trillion. The American Families Plan is expected to include measures aimed at helping U.S. workers learn new skills, expand subsidies for child care and make community college tuition free for all. That proposal would be separate from the $2.3 trillion infrastructure package known as the American Jobs Plan, which would be funded by an increase in the corporate tax rate to 28%. The White House and Democratic lawmakers passed a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package in March. Read the full report about the Biden capital gains plan on Bloomberg .
Senate Republicans outlined their own infrastructure proposal focused on transportation, broadband and water systems. The plan is a fraction of the cost of the one President Joe Biden has proposed, and does not include Democratic goals such as care for elderly and disabled Americans. Biden has said he wants to craft an infrastructure bill Republicans would support, but it is unclear what kind of legislation would assuage both parties.	A group of Senate Republicans outlined their infrastructure plan Thursday, unveiling a much narrower vision for how to revamp U.S. transportation and broadband than the sweeping approach backed by President Joe Biden . The GOP package would cost $568 billion, only a fraction of the Democratic president's more than $2 trillion package. It also would not address policies such as care for elderly and disabled people, which Biden included in his plan. The Republican outline would set aside: The GOP proposal is backed by Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and John Barrasso of Wyoming. Democrats, who have stressed the need for a sprawling infrastructure package, will likely reject the lower price tag. Capito called the framework an effort to start a conversation toward a compromise with Democrats. She said that "we agree that these bills are necessary," and she hopes committees of jurisdiction in the Senate "should be the ones that force the compromise." "I think that we see this as an offer that is on the table and deserves a response," she said. "And I think it will get a response." Capito said the investments would be fully funded, potentially through policies including user fees on electric vehicles and repurposing of state and local relief passed as part of coronavirus aid bills. She said the GOP aims to maintain tax cuts passed in 2017, which Biden wants to partly reverse. The White House has said it hopes to craft an infrastructure bill congressional Republicans will support. The proposal outlined Thursday shows a gulf between the parties' priorities and comfort with federal spending — along with what they even consider infrastructure. It is unclear what bill could win the 60 votes needed to get through the Democratic-held Senate, which is split 50-50 by party. Democratic leaders will have to decide whether to try to pass a larger infrastructure bill on their own — which will require them to navigate opposition within their own ranks — or agree to a smaller plan with the GOP. Spokespeople for Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., did not immediately respond to requests to comment on the GOP framework. Biden has met twice with lawmakers from both parties about infrastructure in recent weeks. A group of centrist Republican and Democratic senators also met Wednesday as they try to find a consensus. Some Democratic lawmakers have suggested the party could approve a transportation and broadband-focused bill with GOP support, then move to pass their broader priorities through a special budget process that requires a simple majority vote. Biden's plan calls to upgrade roads, bridges, airports, trains, housing and broadband, while investing in electric vehicles, care for elderly and disabled Americans and job training programs. It would offset costs by raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and seeking to crack down on offshoring of corporate profits. Republicans have criticized both the scope and cost of Biden's plan. They have also resisted efforts to raise taxes on businesses. Biden's tax proposal has also drawn backlash from within his party. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., has said he supports hiking the corporate rate to 25% rather than 28%. Republicans slashed the tax rate to 21% from 35% in 2017. Biden aims to pass two separate infrastructure and recovery bills. He plans to unveil the second plank, a plan focused on child care, paid leave and tax credits that could cost more than $1 trillion, in the coming weeks. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
Former Citigroup executive Ray McGuire, who is running to be mayor of New York, will receive over $5 million from the Wall Street bank from 2022 through 2025. CNBC obtained McGuire's 2020 financial disclosure report after requesting the document from New York City's Conflict of Interest Board. While McGuire is tied for fifth in the Spectrum News NY1/ Ipsos poll, if he were to win the race for mayor, the Citi payouts could come on top of what he makes as the city's chief executive.	Former Citigroup executive Ray McGuire, who is running to be mayor of New York, will receive a total of more than $5 million from the Wall Street bank from 2022 through 2025. CNBC obtained McGuire's 2020 financial disclosure report after requesting the document from New York City's Conflict of Interest Board. While McGuire is tied for fifth in the Spectrum News NY1/ Ipsos poll, if he were to win the race for mayor, the Citi payouts could come on top of what he makes as the city's chief executive. A Politico report from 2019 shows that New York Mayor Bill de Blasio made more than $250,000 in one year. The filing shows that McGuire will be paid in four equal installments starting next year and ending in 2025, totaling just more than $5.7 million. Citi announced in October that McGuire would be stepping down from his post. He had been at the financial giant for at least 15 years. He officially announced his run for mayor in December. McGuire wouldn't be the only wealthy business leader to become mayor if he were to win. Mike Bloomberg, who currently has a net worth of over $55 billion, was mayor of the city for 12 years. He funded all of his campaigns with his own money. Bloomberg chose to forgo a mayor's salary and accepted just $1 a year. McGuire has raised more than $7 million since he entered the race, with some contributions coming from New York's business leaders. McGuire has been running, at least in part, on his experience as an executive that he believes could help rebuild the city after taking a financial hit throughout the coronavirus pandemic . The upcoming Democratic primary for mayor is set for June. McGuire is behind in the polls. A recent survey from NY1 showed him tied for fifth place in the Democratic primary race with former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan. Andrew Yang , who leads in the latest poll, made between $670,000 and $2.5 million last year , according to Spectrum News. An advisor to McGuire, who also counseled Bloomberg, told CNBC that the former Citi executive will speak with the Conflict of Interest Board to discuss next steps if he were to win the race. The advisor noted that the conversation with the board could include how to handle his assets and agreement with Citi. This advisor declined to be named in order to speak freely about McGuire's plans. Citi said the payout is part of the firm's standard. "Under our regular annual bonus program, a large portion of compensation earned by an employee each year is not paid when earned, but rather is delivered over a four year period," a Citi spokeswoman said. "The treatment of Mr. McGuire's deferred amounts follows our standard policy for employees who retire after long service with Citi." Last year, McGuire appears to have made at least $1 million in 2020 while at Citi, including through capital gains, dividends and interest. He also owns stock in more than 100 companies, including Pfizer, Pepsi, Eli Lilly, AT&T, Nintendo and Bayer. The filing did not include his annual salary. The report also lists over $500,000 in deferred income from Citi. McGuire also has investments in numerous private equity firms and hedge funds. The filing shows that the value of those investments is worth over at least $2 million. McGuire also lists three residential properties that he owns in Ohio, where he was born. The three properties have a combined value of at least $850,000, according to the filing.
Several watchdog and activist groups are pressuring President Joe Biden to publicly release ethics agreements signed by political appointees in his administration. In a letter sent to Biden on Thursday that was shared exclusively with CNBC, over a dozen organizations demanded that the administration publicize the agreements. The groups sent the letter a day after CNBC reported that Jeff Ricchetti, the brother of Biden White House counselor Steve Ricchetti, has lobbied the White House this year.	Several watchdog and activist groups are pressuring President Joe Biden to publicly release ethics agreements signed by political appointees in his administration who are not subject to Senate confirmation. In a letter sent to Biden on Thursday that was shared exclusively with CNBC, over a dozen organizations demanded that the administration publicize the agreements made by his political advisors and others. The groups sent the letter a day after CNBC reported that Jeff Ricchetti, the brother of Biden White House counselor Steve Ricchetti, has lobbied the White House on behalf of health-care companies this year. These political appointees are not required to publicly disclose their ethics agreements, which could include notices of recusal from certain policy matters that may involve prior clients or business dealings. "You have the means to address this lack of transparency right away by requiring that every employee of the White House, in addition to other senior-level political appointees throughout the executive branch, agree to have their ethics documents made publicly available. We, the undersigned, are calling on you to make this commitment without delay," the letter says. The groups who signed the letter include the Revolving Door Project, the Government Accountability Project and Jacobs Institute of Women's Health. The letter comes after several reports showing that many of Biden's advisors who did not have to be confirmed by the Senate were paid millions in their prior lines of work and that some have ties to Wall Street and Big Tech.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday brushed aside a question about whether the Biden administration was concerned by investors' apparent lack of support for its reported proposal to raises capital gains taxes. "I've been doing this long enough not to comment on movements in the stock market," Psaki said, "But I did see data, factually, that it went back up this morning." President Joe Biden's plan reportedly seeks to increase the levy on capital gains to 39.6% from 20% for Americans earning more than $1 million.	President Joe Biden's reported plan to hike capital gains taxes on millionaires may have spooked Wall Street , but Thursday's sudden stock slide didn't seem to shake the White House. Press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday brushed aside a question about whether the Biden administration was concerned by investors' apparent lack of support for the proposal to raises taxes on the rich. "I've been doing this long enough not to comment on movements in the stock market," Psaki said during a press briefing. "But I did see data, factually, that it went back up this morning," she added before moving on. The plan, which seeks to increase the levy on capital gains to 39.6% from 20% for Americans earning more than $1 million, was reported by outlets including Bloomberg News and The New York Times. U.S. stocks on Thursday reversed their gains and turned sharply lower after the reports . Stock indexes closed out Thursday's trading session down about 1%. But by Friday afternoon stocks appeared poised to recover their losses , as analysts predicted that any such taxes hikes would likely be pared down before passing through Congress. "We expect Congress will pass a scaled back version of this tax increase," Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a note . "We expect Congress will settle on a more modest increase, potentially around 28%." The reported tax hike plan would be in keeping with Biden 's 2020 presidential campaign platform, in which he vowed to raise duties on corporations and the wealthiest Americans. The president has repeatedly promised that people making less than $400,000 a year will not see their taxes go up. The White House's nonchalant reaction to the latest stock fluctuations starkly contrasts with the posture of former President Donald Trump, who often touted market gains as an indicator of his administration's success.
President Joe Biden will take his first overseas trip as president this June as he heads to the United Kingdom and Belgium for crucial meetings with allied nations. This news comes amid Biden's virtual climate summit with global leaders as he pushes for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The Biden administration has said it would seek to reset links with various international allies in the wake of President Donald Trump's often-tumultuous relationships with other nations.	President Joe Biden will make his first overseas trip as president in June as he heads to the United Kingdom and Belgium for crucial meetings with allied nations, the White House said Friday. This news comes amid Biden's virtual climate summit with global leaders as he pushes for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. On Thursday Biden vowed to reduce U.S. emissions by at least 50% by 2030 . The Biden administration has said it would seek to reset links with various allies in the wake of President Donald Trump's often-tumultuous relationships with other nations. Trump criticized fellow NATO nations , saying they weren't paying their fair share on defense spending. Biden will begin his travel speaking at the G-7 Summit in Cornwall, U.K., where he'll also hold bilateral meetings with leaders such as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. That summit will occur June 11-13. The president will work to "advance key U.S. policy priorities on public health, economic recovery, and climate change, and demonstrate solidarity and shared values among major democracies," the White House statement read. Biden will then travel to Brussels to attend NATO and U.S.-EU meetings, where he plans to further advance American interests. The NATO meeting is set for June 14. One topic for NATO discussion could be Russia's recent escalation of its troop presence on its border with Ukraine to the highest level it's been since 2014. However, Russia on Thursday ordered those troops to begin returning to their home bases after what it called a successfully completed "snap inspection." Another potential discussion point could be NATO's withdrawal of military forces from Afghanistan, where the alliance's noncombat Resolute Support Mission has aided Afghan troops since 2015. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said further details about Biden's trip were to come, "including potential additional elements."
Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is set to be sentenced June 16 on charges including second-degree unintentional murder in the death of George Floyd, a Minnesota court said Friday, NBC News reported. The calendar update came three days after a jury found Chauvin, 45, guilty on charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, all related to Floyd's death. Chauvin's attorneys will have 60 days to appeal the outcome, NBC reported.	Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is scheduled to be sentenced June 16 after his conviction this week on charges including second-degree unintentional murder in the death of George Floyd , a Minnesota court said Friday. Chauvin's sentencing will take place at 1:30 p.m. CT, according to the court schedule, NBC News reported. The calendar update came three days after a jury found Chauvin, 45, guilty on charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter , all related to Floyd's death. Chauvin's attorneys will have 60 days to appeal the outcome, NBC reported . Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died after Chauvin kneeled on his neck for more than nine minutes. Video of the incident sparked a nationwide protest movement against police brutality and systemic racism. The most serious charge against Chauvin carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, though sentencing guidelines often call for much less prison time than the maximum. Chauvin's sentencing date is scheduled to come more than eight weeks after the anonymous 12-member jury delivered its verdict, following about 10 hours of deliberation at the end of the three-week trial in Minnesota.
President Joe Biden on Saturday recognized the killing of 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Empire forces in the early 20th century as a genocide, a historic though largely symbolic move that will likely strain already fraught relations with Turkey. Biden's declaration is a major break from past U.S. administrations, which avoided calling the atrocities genocide due to concerns over alienating Turkey, an important NATO ally and influential power in the Middle East. Turkey has contested that the killings constitute a genocide. The Trump administration refrained from recognizing the events as a genocide, instead labeling them as "mass atrocities."	President Joe Biden on Saturday recognized the killing of 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Empire forces in the early 20th century as a genocide, a historic though largely symbolic move that will likely strain already fraught relations with Turkey. Biden's declaration is a major break from past U.S. administrations, which avoided calling the atrocities genocide due to concerns over alienating Turkey, an important NATO ally and influential power in the Middle East. Turkey has contested that the killings constitute a genocide. "Each year on this day, we remember the lives of all those who died in the Ottoman-era Armenian genocide and recommit ourselves to preventing such an atrocity from ever again occurring," Biden said in a statement on Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day. As a candidate, Biden last year vowed to make this declaration, which is widely supported by human rights groups and Armenians. The Trump administration refrained from recognizing the events as a genocide, instead labeling them as "mass atrocities." Following the arrest of Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in Constantinople – now known as Istanbul – by Ottoman authorities, roughly 1.5 million Armenians were killed in the events known as Meds Yeghern that took place from 1915 - 1923. "A world unstained by the daily evils of bigotry and intolerance, where human rights are respected, and where all people are able to pursue their lives in dignity and security," Biden said. "Let us renew our shared resolve to prevent future atrocities from occurring anywhere in the world. And let us pursue healing and reconciliation for all the people of the world." The Turkey Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Saturday that the Biden administration's statement would "open a deep wound that undermines our mutual trust and friendship." Biden and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in a phone call Friday, agreed to hold a bilateral meeting on the margins of the NATO Summit in June. "It is an important day for all Armenians. Following the resolutions adopted by US Congress in 2019, President Biden honored the memory of victims of the Armenian Genocide," Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan wrote in a tweet on Saturday . "The US has once again demonstrated its unwavering commitment to protecting human rights and universal values," Pashinyan wrote. Read the full statement from the White House:
More than half of Americans say they support President Joe Biden's performance in office and approve of his sweeping infrastructure proposal, according to a new NBC News poll. The poll findings released Sunday showed that 53% of respondents approve of Biden's job in office, including 90% of Democrats, 61% of independents and 9% of Republicans. Participants were less happy with how Biden has handled relations with China, gun issues and border security and immigration.	More than half of Americans say they support President Joe Biden 's performance in office so far and approve of his sweeping infrastructure proposal , according to a new NBC News poll. The poll findings released Sunday showed that 53% of respondents approve of Biden's job in office, including 90% of Democrats, 61% of independents and 9% of Republicans, while 39% of respondents disapprove of Biden's performance. The president also received support for his coronavirus relief package passed in March and his $2 trillion infrastructure proposal aimed to help boost the post-pandemic economy. The poll showed that 46% percent of Americans believed the president's $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill —which sent direct payments to Americans and extended unemployment insurance, among other policies —was a good idea, while 25% said it was a bad idea and 26% did not have an opinion. Additionally, 61% of respondents said they believe the worst of the pandemic is over in the U.S., while only 19% think the worst is yet to come. Biden's infrastructure plan, which aims to revitalize U.S. transportation infrastructure, water systems, broadband and manufacturing, as well as combat climate change , was also popular among respondents. 59% said the plan is a good idea, while 21% disagreed and 19% did not have an opinion. Responses diverged across party lines: 87% of Democrats, 68% of independents and 21% of Republicans said they supported the infrastructure plan. "What we don't know is if this is part of a 100-day honeymoon or something more durable and lasting for the Biden-Harris administration," Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the poll with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies, told NBC News. "What we do know is that Joe Biden's presidency is meeting the times," Horwitt said. The president also received high marks on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which garnered 69% approval, as well as his handling of the economy, which received 52% approval. On the issue of uniting the country and grappling with race relations, 52% and 49% of respondents approved, respectively. Participants were less happy with how Biden has handled relations with China, gun issues and border security and immigration. The poll also showed that 80% of people still believe the U.S. is mostly divided, despite Biden's pledge to unify the country. The poll surveyed 1,000 adults nationwide from April 17 to April 20. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
Sen. Joe Manchin said he wants to focus President Joe Biden's sprawling $2 trillion infrastructure proposal on traditional infrastructure issues and cut spending on other items in the plan. Manchin, a key figure in negotiations over the president's proposal, also praised the Republicans' counteroffer proposal, which is a fraction of the cost of the one Biden has unveiled. Biden has said he wants to have an infrastructure bill Republicans also support, though it's unclear what kind of legislation would receive bipartisan support.	Sen. Joe Manchin said he would support a more targeted version of President Joe Biden 's sprawling $2 trillion infrastructure package before focusing on other items as part of a separate plan. "I do think they should be separated, because, when you start putting so much into one bill, which we call an omnibus bill, makes it very, very difficult for the public to understand," the moderate West Virginia Democrat said during an interview on CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday. Manchin, a key figure in negotiations over the president's proposal, also praised the Republicans' counteroffer proposal , which is a fraction of the cost of the one Biden has unveiled and excludes Democratic goals like care for elderly and disabled Americans. Manchin said the GOP plan is "a good start" and that a bipartisan proposal should tackle traditional infrastructure issues, such as repairing roads and bridges. "And they have worked it together. So, we know it has bipartisan support," Manchin said. "We just have to look to see if we have gotten everything in there that we need. And we will be working on that together. So, I'm very, very pleased with that." Biden has said he wants to have an infrastructure bill Republicans also support, though it's unclear what kind of legislation would receive bipartisan consensus. Democrats could also move forward to pass a bill on their own through budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority in the Senate, if the GOP doesn't agree to a deal. However, Manchin has said he opposes using reconciliation. Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who backed the GOP bill along with Roger Wicker of Mississippi, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and John Barrasso of Wyoming, said on Sunday that she's received an "encouraging" response from the Biden administration regarding their plan. "I have talked to our ranking members. I have talked to my committee chairmen. I have talked to Democrats," Capito said on CNN. "This is an active conversation, and I think that it's a good beginning." The president has met with Republican and Democratic lawmakers twice about infrastructure in recent weeks and is expected to unveil the second part of his infrastructure and economic recovery plan next week.
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan advocated for a more narrowly focused infrastructure plan that cuts huge chunks out of the $2 trillion proposal put forward by President Joe Biden. The GOP governor also criticized the next phase of Biden's sweeping economic recovery plan, which is expected to be unveiled this week. "We should separate out all of this other family infrastructure they're talking about and all these massive tax hikes on the rich and on corporations," Hogan said.	Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan advocated Monday for a more narrowly focused infrastructure plan that cuts huge chunks out of the $2 trillion proposal put forward by President Joe Biden. The GOP governor also criticized the next phase of Biden's sweeping economic recovery plan, which is expected to be unveiled this week and will reportedly include tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans . "We should separate out all of this other family infrastructure they're talking about and all these massive tax hikes on the rich and on corporations," Hogan told CNBC's " Squawk Box ." Hogan, who hosted a two-day infrastructure summit last week with a bipartisan group of governors and lawmakers, said "rebuilding America's infrastructure is a critical issue that we all agree on, and we all think it should be a bipartisan effort." "We can agree on finding that middle ground," Hogan said. However, "the second set of things that the president is apparently going to unveil for the first time on Wednesday is really not – has nothing to do with infrastructure, and most of us think it should be handled separately." Hogan has become a prominent figure in the Republican Party, largely due to his criticism of former President Donald Trump. He hasn't ruled out running for the White House himself in 2024. Hogan's comments came a day after Sen. Joe Manchin — the West Virginia Democrat whose more conservative views give him outsize influence in the politically divided Senate — issued his own call for a more targeted approach to infrastructure. "I do think they should be separated, because, when you start putting so much into one bill, which we call an omnibus bill, makes it very, very difficult for the public to understand," Manchin said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union ." Manchin — one of the 27 political leaders who attended Hogan's summit in Annapolis, Maryland — also praised a GOP-backed counteroffer on infrastructure , which is less than one-third the size of Biden's plan and excludes key items. Meanwhile, a recent NBC News poll shows Biden's infrastructure proposal is popular among Americans thus far. The survey of 1,000 U.S. adults found that 59% said the plan is a good idea, while 21% disagreed and 19% did not have an opinion. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. Hogan said on CNBC that the first step in the negotiations between parties involves agreeing on a definition of infrastructure. "There's a $1.6 trillion difference between what the Republicans have proposed and what the Democrats have proposed," he said. "That's really the main sticking point." Asked how much he believes will ultimately be spent on infrastructure, Hogan said he would guess at somewhere between $900 billion and $1.1 trillion — about half the size of what the Biden administration is currently pushing for. But the second part of the White House's plan to overhaul the U.S. economy is expected to come with at least a $1 trillion price tag. The proposal could also include $500 billion in tax credits, a source told CNBC last week . Hogan said the summit's attendees agreed with Manchin that lawmakers should focus just on a straightforward plan to address infrastructure. That includes "digital infrastructure and green energy and the grid"  along with roads and bridges. He added: "We can agree on finding that middle ground." However, Hogan also said the reported tax hikes in the next phase are punitive, revenue-losing propositions. "We should separate out all of this other family infrastructure they're talking about and all these massive tax hikes on the rich and on corporations, set that aside for a later debate while we focus on infrastructure, which is something that Republicans and Democrats do agree on and where we can find common ground and get it done," he said. "There's trillions of dollars of private-sector capital willing to invest in infrastructure, so it's not just about taxing folks," the governor said. "It's not just about raising the capital gains tax and taxing the rich."
Several corporate giants have lobbied the White House and Congress over President Joe Biden's Covid relief bill and infrastructure proposal. Microsoft, Koch Industries, Verizon, Delta, T-Mobile, Lockheed Martin and Comcast are among the companies that have lobbied officials over the Covid bill or the infrastructure package. CNBC previously reported on how business leaders have been reaching out to the administration to share their ideas on how to pay for Biden's infrastructure plan.	Several corporate giants have been actively lobbying the White House and members of Congress over two of President Joe Biden's massive spending packages. At least two dozen organizations have focused their lobbying efforts on Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which he signed into law in March , and his $2 trillion infrastructure proposal , according to first-quarter disclosure reports reviewed by CNBC. The reports span from January, the month Biden was inaugurated, through the end of March. Microsoft, Koch Industries, Verizon, Delta, Bayer, Pacific Gas and Electric, T-Mobile, Lockheed Martin and Comcast are among the companies that have lobbied officials over the Covid bill or the infrastructure package. In some cases, the corporations lobbied D.C. power brokers over both measures. Major trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers have also deployed lobbyists to influence the initiatives. Corporate lobbyists engaged with various departments within Biden's administration, including the White House Office, which is headed by the president's chief of staff, Ron Klain. The White House did not respond to requests for comment before publication. All of the companies mentioned in this story either declined to comment or did not respond to requests seeking comment. CNBC has previously reported on how business leaders have been reaching out to the administration to share their ideas on how to pay for Biden's infrastructure plan. Biden wants to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% , which some corporations and many business-friendly groups have opposed. Telecommunications company T-Mobile paid $90,000 to Putala Strategies during the first quarter. The firm was founded by Christopher Putala, who has been engaging with the White House Office for T-Mobile over the past three months. A White House official told CNBC that Putala did not lobby Klain himself. The official did not say whom the T-Mobile lobbyist engaged with within the White House Office. Putala was a lawyer for Biden when he served on the Senate Judiciary Committee. According to the lobbying report, Putala has worked to influence the White House on both Biden's infrastructure plan and coronavirus relief proposal. The filing says Putala lobbied the White House and Congress on "broadband industry practices; issues concerning the provision of wireless services; spectrum management issues; American Rescue Plan Act of 2021; and Administration infrastructure proposal (The American Jobs Plan)." Biden's infrastructure plan proposes investing $100 billion as a way to expand public access to broadband. The spending would target underserved areas and prioritize support for broadband networks affiliated with local governments, nonprofits and cooperatives. Delta Air Lines paid $30,000 to Rowland Strategy Group in the first quarter to lobby, at least in part, both the Covid relief bill and the infrastructure package. The lobbyist leading the account is James Rowland, the founder of the firm, and he has engaged with members of Congress. The report notes that Rowland lobbied on "Congressional economic recovery responses to COVID pandemic; American Rescue Plan, American Jobs Plan." Prior to launching his lobbying shop, Rowland's prior experience includes being a chief counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee for about a year starting in 2000, according to his LinkedIn page. Biden's plan looks to invest $621 billion into transportation infrastructure such as bridges, roads and airports. Senate Republicans have proposed putting $44 billion into airports. Koch Industries, Verizon, Bayer and Microsoft were some of the companies that focused on lobbying the Covid relief bill in the first quarter. Koch, a massive conglomerate run by libertarian billionaire and political activist Charles Koch, spent over $2.6 million on lobbying in the first quarter. Part of its focus went toward lobbying Congress on the Covid relief bill, according to the disclosure report. The filing also says the company lobbied on Biden's "Build Back Better Jobs and Economic Recovery plan and related draft legislation." That plan includes his infrastructure proposal. Microsoft spent just over $2.5 million on lobbying throughout the first three months of 2021. The Covid relief bill was among many issues Microsoft lobbied earlier in the year, according to documents. When it came to the Covid bill and the other issues, Microsoft lobbied members of Congress, the Executive Office of the President and other administration agencies. The Executive Office of the President includes several advisory groups for the president, including the Council of Economic Advisors, the National Security Council and the Office of Management and Budget. Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC.
The mysterious $100 million company that owns just a New Jersey deli killed a consulting agreement that had paid a firm controlled by the father of the deli company chairman $15,000 per month, a financial filing revealed. The move to end the consulting deal with Tryon Capital LLC came after CNBC detailed the close ties between Tryon's Peter Coker Sr. and Hometown International, whose chairman is Peter Coker Jr. At the same time on Monday E-Waste — a shell company linked to both Coker Sr. and to Hometown International — ended its own consulting deal, which was paying Tryon Capital $2,500 per month, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing said. Manoj Jain, the founder of Maso Capital in Hong Kong, a major investor in Hometown International, lauded the decision to end the agreements.	The mysterious $100 million company that owns only a single New Jersey deli on Monday killed the consulting agreement that since last May has been paying $15,000 per month to a firm controlled by the father of its chairman, according to a financial filing. The move by Hometown International to end the consulting deal with Tryon Capital LLC by mutual agreement came after articles by CNBC detailing close ties between Tryon Capital partner Peter Coker Sr. and the deli owner, whose chairman is Hong Kong-based Peter Coker Jr. The elder Coker is also a shareholder in Hometown International, whose sales in the past two years combined were about $10,000 less than what the company paid Tryon Capital in consulting fees. "In light of the recent negative press regarding the Company and the principals of Tryon, the parties determined that it was in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to terminate the Consulting Agreement at this time," Hometown International said in its 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. "The parties believe that such termination will reduce distractions and enable the Company to move forward with its planned acquisition strategy," the filing said. The filing was signed by Hometown International CEO Paul Morina, who is also principal and head wrestling coach at Paulsboro High School in Paulsboro, New Jersey, where the deli is also located. At the same time on Monday E-Waste — a shell company linked to both Coker Sr. and to Hometown International — ended its own consulting deal, which was paying Tryon Capital $2,500 per month, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing said. E-Waste's own 8-K filing announcing the end of the consulting agreement likewise noted "the recent negative press" regarding that firm "and the principals of Tryon." The end of the contracts was lauded by Manoj Jain, the founder of Maso Capital in Hong Kong, a major investor in Hometown International. Maso Capital is understood to be using Hometown International and E-Waste as vehicles for acquisitions. Jain in a statement made a reference to CNBC's reporting over the last week or so about past controversies surrounding Peter Coker Sr., others associated with Tryon Capital, and E-Waste. "We are very concerned by these serious allegations and we are glad that the relationship between both companies and Tryon Consulting has now been terminated," Jain said in a statement to CNBC. "We look forward to both public companies taking forward their stated acquisition plans," Jain said. Jain holds sole voting power over about 2.5 million common stock shares of Hometown International, or more than 20% of the nearly 8 million common shares outstanding. The stock closed Monday at $13.29 per share, up .38%. An SEC filing by Hometown International in April 2020 and a similar filing by E-Waste this month suggest that both companies intend to use investments by Jain and others to finance efforts to evaluate potential merger candidates with other companies, particularly private firms. The filings by each company almost exactly a year apart indicate they either sold or were selling 2.5 million shares of stock apiece as part of those efforts. While Hometown International has had sales of only about $36,000 in the past two years combined at its Paulsboro deli, and E-Waste has no business to speak of, both companies could be attractive to private companies looking to become publicly traded entities in the United States through the use of a reverse merger or other means. The end of Tryon Capital's consulting deals comes days after Hometown International was delisted from the more prestigious over-the-counter market platform OTCQB, and relegated to the less prestigious Pink market because of "public interest concerns." Hometown International also was slapped with a "buyer beware" warning label by OTC Markets Group, which operates those marketplaces. Executives at OTC Markets said the demotion resulted from "irregularities" in Hometown International's public disclosures. OTC Markets executives also said they were eyeing the filings of E-Waste, whose mailing address is that of another North Carolina company linked to Coker Sr., who has lent E-Waste more than $200,000. E-Waste also owes $150,000 to Hometown International, according to a promissory note filed with the SEC. E-Waste, which trades on the Pink market, had no sales of stock recorded Monday, ending the day at $8.41 per share, giving it a market capitalization of an eye-popping $105 million. CNBC has detailed how Peter Coker Sr., who holds more than 63,000 shares of Hometown common stock, has been sued in the past for allegedly hiding money from creditors and business-related fraud . He has denied those allegations. In August 1992, Coker Sr. was arrested in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and charged "with prostitution and other offenses after he allegedly exposed himself to three girls as he drove around" a school one night, The Morning Call newspaper reported at the time. Coker Sr. and his son have not responded to repeated requests for comment. CNBC also has detailed Coker Sr.'s ties to E-Waste. Coker Sr.'s partner in Tryon Capital, Peter Reichard, in 2011 entered a plea in a criminal case that led to his conviction for a scheme to illegally contribute thousands of dollars to the successful 2008 campaign for North Carolina governor of Bev Perdue, a Democrat. The scheme involved the use of a bogus consulting contract between Tryon Capital Ventures and a fast-food franchisee who wanted to support Perdue. Coker Sr. was not charged in that case. Reichard also is a managing member, with Coker Sr., of an entity called Europa Capital Investments, which owns 90,400 common shares of Hometown International, and has warrants for another 1.9 million shares. James Patten, a financial analyst at Tryon Capital, wrestled in high school with Morina, Hometown International's CEO. Patten is barred by FINRA, the broker-dealer regulator, from acting as a stockbroker or associating with broker-dealers, according to the regulator's database, which details multiple disciplinary actions against Patten over his career. Hometown International has drawn widespread scrutiny for nearly two weeks after hedge fund manager David Einhorn noted that the company's market capitalization topped $100 million despite the company owning just a tiny deli. A major investor in both Hometown and E-Waste is a Macao, China-based entity named Global Equity Limited. An owner of Global Equity, Michael Tyldesley, is listed in financial filings as managing director of another Macao entity, VCH Limited, which also holds shares in Hometown International. VCH Limited has a consulting agreement with Hometown International that pays it $25,000 per month, according to SEC filings. That agreement was not mentioned in the filings Monday that announced the cancellation of Tryon Capital's consulting agreements with Hometown International and E-Waste.
Attorney General Merrick Garland on Monday announced that the Department of Justice will open an investigation into the practices of the Louisville, Kentucky, police department. The announcement comes days after Garland said the DOJ will investigate the Minneapolis Police Department following Derek Chauvin's conviction for the murder of George Floyd. Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was killed last year by Louisville police officers who entered her apartment with a no-knock warrant and fired 32 bullets.	Attorney General Merrick Garland on Monday announced that the Department of Justice will open an investigation into the practices of the Louisville Metro Police Department in Kentucky. The announcement comes days after Garland said the DOJ will investigate the Minneapolis Police Department following Derek Chauvin's conviction for the murder of George Floyd, whose killing in custody sparked global protests. Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was killed last year by Louisville police officers who entered her apartment with a no-knock warrant and fired 32 bullets. Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired a shot at officers, whom he has said he believed to be intruders. Garland said the investigation was spurred by a comprehensive review of public information. "As with every Justice Department investigation, we will follow the facts and the law wherever they lead," Garland said. A grand jury indicted one of the officers in the raid , Sgt. Brett Hankison, on wanton endangerment charges last year. His trial was delayed this month until 2022. Two other officers involved have not been criminally charged. Taylor's death is among the most high-profile police killings in recent years and has prompted calls to rein in the use of no-knock warrants and other controversial tactics. Garland said the DOJ will take into consideration the terms of a $12 million settlement reached between Louisville and Taylor's family last year. The settlement requires the police department to undertake certain mandatory reforms. Justice Department pattern-or-practice investigations into police departments can lead to settlements, or consent decrees, between the DOJ and the department, often requiring independent oversight of the police and other changes. The DOJ under former President Donald Trump largely curtailed the use of consent decrees, but Garland reversed that policy earlier this month . President Joe Biden has pledged to pursue substantial reforms of the nation's policing through Congress. In a statement on Monday, Derrick Johnson, the president of the NAACP, praised Garland's move. "For far too long, killings at the hands of police have only led to one hashtag after another. But true justice comes with accountability and action," Johnson said. "We applaud the Justice Department's new investigation into the Louisville Metro Police Department for the murder of Breonna Taylor and their ongoing practices. No police officer or police department is above the law."
President Joe Biden's top economic advisor defended a plan to raise the capital gains tax as neither too large a burden nor a barrier to business investment. Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, said the plan would raise the capital gains tax for 0.3% of households, those that make more than $1 million. "For the other 997 out of 1,000 households in the country ... this is not a change that will be relevant," Deese told reporters.	President Joe Biden's top economic advisor on Monday defended a plan to raise the capital gains tax on the nation's wealthiest households as neither too large a burden nor a barrier to business investment. Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, said during a news conference that the president's plan would raise the capital gains tax for 0.3% of U.S. households — those that make more than $1 million in annual income. It's "not the top 1%, it's not even the top one-half of 1%," Deese said from the White House. "For the other 997 out of 1,000 households in the country ... this is not a change that will be relevant. It won't change the tax treatment of capital gains at all." He explained that the proposed tax increase would target those households that do not typically derive the majority of their income through workplace wages. "For the typical Americans, most of their income comes from wages," he said. "So, for people making less than $1 million a year, about 70% of their income comes from wages. But for those making more than $1 million, for the top 0.3%, it's the opposite. About 30% of their [income] comes from wages." Though Deese did not mention a specific rate, his appearance Monday during a White House briefing lent credibility to reports that the administration will seek to hike the capital gains rate to 39.6% for households making more than $1 million. Biden is expected to formally debut the proposal on Wednesday as a way to fund spending in the upcoming American Families Plan, thought to feature a price tag of around $1 trillion. That piece of legislation, separate from the infrastructure-based American Jobs Plan, is believed to include measures aimed at helping U.S. workers learn new skills, expand subsidies for child care and make community college tuition free for all. Asked to address criticism that raising the capital gains rate could dampen investment in U.S. business, Deese argued that there's no evidence to support that claim. The capital gains tax is especially important to Wall Street since it dictates how large a chunk of an equity sale is collected by the federal government. "Across a wide body of academic and empirical evidence, there is no evidence of a significant impact of capital gains rates on the level of long-term investment in the economy," he said. "There's lots of reasons for that, including that, if you look at where a lot of venture capital and early stage investment comes from, it actually comes from pension funds, wealth funds, entities that actually are not tax sensitive." Deese also contended that the revenue generated by a higher rate on the richest Americans could then be deployed in programs and subsidies that have been shown to increase economic output over time. "Investments, for example, in early childhood and in our children return enormous dividends in terms of their own academic success, reduced cost in the health-care system, productivity and growth in the future," the NEC director and former Obama official told reporters.
The Supreme Court agreed to hear a major Second Amendment dispute that could settle whether the Constitution protects a right to carry guns in public. The decision comes as President Joe Biden faces pressure from activists to take action to limit the availability of high-powered weapons amid outcries over mass shootings.	The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a major Second Amendment dispute that could settle whether the Constitution protects a right to carry guns in public. The decision, announced in an order , comes as President Joe Biden faces pressure from activists to take action to limit the availability of high-powered weapons amid outcries over mass shootings. Those in favor of increased gun control measures have expressed concern that the nation's top court, which has a 6-3 majority of Republican appointees, could expand the reach of the Second Amendment. In two landmark cases handed down more than a decade ago, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment protects the individual right to carry a gun for self-defense inside the home. Last year, it declined to issue a substantial ruling in its first major Second Amendment case since. In the case the court agreed to hear Monday, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Keith Corlett, No. 20-843, individuals and a state organization are challenging a New York law that requires individuals to show "proper cause" in order to receive a permit for the open carry of a handgun. Robert Nash and Brandon Koch, the individuals who brought the suit, both applied for licenses to carry handguns for self-defense and were denied. A district court reasoned that neither man had proper cause because neither faced "any special or unique danger to [their] life." A federal appeals court upheld the lower court's decision not to grant the men licenses. In their appeal to the Supreme Court, authored by former Solicitor General Paul Clement, the men argued that New York's law was unconstitutional under the top court's precedents in District of Columbia v. Heller, decided in 2008, and McDonald v. City of Chicago, decided in 2010. "As this Court made clear in both Heller and McDonald, the Second Amendment, at its core, guarantees a right to keep and bear arms for self-defense," Clement wrote . "Like the threats that might precipitate a need to act in self-defense, that individual and fundamental right necessarily extends beyond the four walls of one's home." New York Attorney General Letitia James wrote in a brief urging the justices not to grant the case that New York's law was consistent with the Supreme Court's Heller and McDonald rulings. In McDonald, the court wrote that its opinion wasn't meant to strike down certain "longstanding prohibitions" on gun use. James wrote that New York's law had existed in the same essential form since 1913, and was "supported by a centuries-old tradition of state and local measures regulating the carrying of firearms in public." In addition, she wrote, "New York's law directly advances the State's compelling interests in protecting the public from gun violence." It was widely expected that the Supreme Court would soon take up another major case over the Second Amendment. Last term, the court granted another case brought by the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association that challenged rules prohibiting the transport of handguns outside New York City. The court ultimately refused to rule on the case after city and state officials eliminated the policy. A majority of the justices decided that the case had become moot, or no longer relevant. At that time, however, three of the court's conservatives, Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, said they would not have dismissed the case. A fourth, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, said he agreed with the majority's decision but nonetheless hoped the justices would address another Second Amendment case "soon." The court surprised observers a few months later when it refused to hear any of 10 Second Amendment cases that had reached the justices. Thomas, at the time, took issue with the court's refusal to hear one case stemming from a New Jersey law similar to the New York law being challenged by Nash and Koch. The conservative justice wrote that "in several jurisdictions throughout the country, law-abiding citizens have been barred from exercising the fundamental right to bear arms because they cannot show that they have a 'justifiable need' or 'good reason' for doing so." "One would think that such an onerous burden on a fundamental right would warrant this Court's review," Thomas added. A decision is expected by the summer of 2022.
Rep. Richard Neal, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, will outline investments in what Democrats are calling "human capital." Neal's bill — the Building an Economy for Families Act — would provide universal paid family and medical leave of up to 12 weeks. It would also make permanent expansions to tax credits introduced in President Biden's Covid-19 relief package.	The Democrat in command of the House's key tax-writing committee is offering a list of priorities aimed at providing sweeping new benefits to working parents and families. Rep. Richard Neal, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and gatekeeper of new tax legislation, plans on Tuesday to outline investments in what Democrats are calling "human capital." Neal's big-ticket bill — the Building an Economy for Families Act — would provide universal paid family and medical leave of up to 12 weeks. That amounts to about two-thirds of a worker's wages. The bill would also establish a new refundable payroll tax credit of up to $5,000 per year for wages paid by certain child-care providers and would create a new information network to give parents and guardians real-time information about available child care. If passed, it would make permanent expansions to tax credits introduced in President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package. Doing so would apply to the child tax credit, the earned income tax credit and the child and dependent care credit. House Democrats have expressed particular support for locking in the expanded child tax credit passed under the American Rescue Plan. That amped-up credit, which will start going to families in July, provides up to $3,600 per child for 2021 depending on the age of each child. Without additional legislation, the expanded credit is set to last only through the current year. Neal's bill may put him at odds with the president, who has expressed doubts over its chances of success in a Senate split 50-50. Biden is expected on Wednesday to try to persuade lawmakers to back his American Families Plan , which would extend the strengthened child tax credit through 2025 but not extend it indefinitely. That legislation, separate from the infrastructure-based American Jobs Plan, includes measures aimed at helping U.S. workers learn new skills, expand subsidies for child care and make community college tuition free for all. National Economic Council director Brian Deese on Monday defended a plan to raise the capital gains tax on the nation's wealthiest households to help pay for the president's plan. Last week, multiple news outlets reported that the Biden administration will seek to raise the tax to 39.6% on households that make at least $1 million in annual income. CNBC's Ylan Mui asked Neal how he hopes to pay for the never-ending credit and the rest of the Building an Economy for Families Act and if he would support raising the tax rate on capital gains. "We wanted to develop a design and then we will address the issue of revenue," he said. "But treat this as an economic investment. This is about increasing productivity. This is about increasing stability in our homes." — CNBC's Ylan Mui contributed to this report.
In an interview with CNBC's "Squawk Box," the Massachusetts progressive senator specifically blasted FedEx, Nike and Amazon while describing why corporations should get with hit with a higher tax rate. "What's happening right now in America is these small businesses they pay their taxes at the full rate. They got to pay the whole thing," Warren said.	Sen. Elizabeth Warren took aim at FedEx , Nike and Amazon on Tuesday as she championed the need to raise taxes on corporations and the wealthiest Americans. In an interview with CNBC's " Squawk Box ," the Massachusetts progressive senator specifically blasted the three corporate giants while describing why corporations should get with hit with a higher tax rate. "What's happening right now in America is these small businesses ... pay their taxes at the full rate. They got to pay the whole thing," Warren said. "You look at businesses like FedEx and Nike, businesses like Amazon, and they pay zero. Right now there's a thumb on the scale in the tax part of this, and that is a thumb to help the giants." Big corporations' lower tax bills actually hurt small businesses by knocking them out of the competition, Warren argued. Warren's latest criticism of corporate giants comes as President Joe Biden and Democrats are looking to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% to help pay for a $2 trillion infrastructure package. Warren, a member of the Senate finance and banking committees, has been calling on the wealthy and corporations to pay what she believes is their fair share of taxes. One of Warren's latest battles has been with billionaire Leon Cooperman , whom she asked to attend a Senate Finance Committee hearing meant to focus on her proposed millionaires' tax. He declined to attend the Tuesday hearing. Warren again took aim at Cooperman, who often appears on CNBC, in prepared remarks for her Tuesday hearing. "I'm disappointed that Mr. Cooperman decided he was more comfortable taking softball questions on cable news than subjecting his views to debate in the U.S. Senate" the prepared remarks said. "Mr. Cooperman may have been too frightened to come here today, but others were not." FedEx and Nike were mentioned in an April report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy as companies that recently paid little-to-no federal corporate income taxes. "The delivery giant FedEx zeroed out its federal income tax on $1.2 billion of U.S. pretax income in 2020 and received a rebate of $230 million," the report said. "The shoe manufacturer Nike didn't pay a dime of federal income tax on almost $2.9 billion of U.S. pretax income last year, instead enjoying a $109 million tax rebate." The progressive group Tax March has been targeting the two corporations in TV and newspaper ads. FedEx CEO Fred Smith said in a letter to company members that they "pay all U.S. federal, state, and local taxes FedEx owes, which have totaled nearly $9 billion over the last five fiscal years." Smith also discouraged the raising of the corporate tax rate as a way to pay for infrastructure. As for Amazon, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimated the e-commerce giant's federal tax rate was just 9.4% in 2020. That's well be low the "statutory" rate of 21%. The report also noted that "over the first three years of the Trump-GOP tax law, which dropped the statutory corporate tax rate to 21 percent, Amazon paid an effective federal income tax rate of just 4.3 percent on U.S. income." Amazon has pushed back on criticism by blaming Congress for the state of the tax code . CEO Jeff Bezos, meanwhile, has said he supports an increase in the corporate tax rate . Warren pinned the blame for the current tax code on corporate lobbyists such as those working for Amazon. "How do you think the tax code ended up like it did? It ended up like it did because companies like Amazon sent armies of lawyers and lobbyists to craft every possible loophole that they would be able to use to pay nothing in taxes," Warren said Tuesday. Amazon invested a record amount of more than $18 million into lobbying in 2020, according to data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. One of the company's recent lobbying recent hires was Jeff Ricchetti, the brother of White House counselor Steve Ricchetti. The Amazon lobbying effort focused on several issues, including tax policy.
The nation's top representative to Afghanistan said Tuesday he doesn't think the Afghan government will collapse after U.S. and foreign troops leave the war-torn country later this year. "I do not believe the government is going to collapse or the Taliban is going to take over," U.S. Special Representative to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad told senators. Khalilzad's testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee comes after President Joe Biden announced the U.S. would complete its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan by Sept. 11.	The nation's top representative to Afghanistan said Tuesday that he doesn't think the Afghan government will collapse after U.S. and foreign troops leave the war-torn country later this year. "I do not believe the government is going to collapse or the Taliban is going to take over," U.S. Special Representative to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad said during testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Khalilzad's testimony comes after President Joe Biden announced the U.S. would complete its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, effectively ending America's longest war. The decision to leave Afghanistan has triggered an array of reactions in Washington, with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle lauding and criticizing the move. It has also triggered some concern within the highest echelons of the military. Last week, the head of U.S. forces in the Middle East told lawmakers he was concerned that the Afghan military will collapse after U.S. and foreign troops leave. "I am concerned about the ability of the Afghan military to hold on after we leave, the ability of the Afghan Air Force to fly, in particular, after we remove the support for those aircraft," McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said during a Senate Armed Services committee hearing on April 22. Afghan forces, he said, have gotten used to the support from U.S. and other nations' militaries over several years. Later at the Pentagon, McKenzie told reporters that while the U.S. will continue to support Afghanistan from afar, he was particularly concerned about aircraft maintenance. The machines are maintained largely by contractors from the U.S. and other nations, he explained. The U.S. intends to find innovative ways of replacing these services without involving boots on the ground, he added.
The FBI confirmed Tuesday that it will investigate the killing of Andrew Brown Jr., a Black man who died after police shot him during an arrest in North Carolina last week. The announcement comes a day after attorneys for Brown's family, allowed to watch a 20-second video of his arrest, said the 42-year-old was shot in the back of the head while he had his hands on his steering wheel. Brown was killed Wednesday, one day after a jury found Derek Chauvin guilty of the murder of George Floyd, whose death in custody reinvigorated the movement opposing police brutality against Black people.	The Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed Tuesday that it will investigate the killing of Andrew Brown Jr., a Black man who died after police shot him during an arrest in North Carolina last week. The announcement comes a day after attorneys for Brown's family, allowed to watch a 20-second video of his arrest, said the 42-year-old was shot in the back of the head while he had his hands on his steering wheel. Brown was shot five times in all, including four times in his right arm, according to an autopsy conducted at the request of his family. Brown was killed by sheriff's deputies in Elizabeth City during an attempt to serve drug-related search and arrest warrants. Seven of the deputies involved in the arrest were placed on paid leave, the Pasquotank County Sheriff's Office said. "The FBI Charlotte Field Office has opened a federal civil rights investigation into the police-involved shooting death of Andrew Brown Jr.," an FBI spokesman said. "Agents will work closely with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina and the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice to determine whether federal laws were violated." The spokesman declined to comment further, saying the investigation was ongoing. Brown was killed Wednesday, one day after a jury found former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin guilty of the murder of George Floyd. Floyd's death in custody reinvigorated the movement opposing police brutality against Black people. The Justice Department is pursuing a civil rights investigation into Floyd's killing in addition to a pattern-or-practice probe into the Minneapolis Police Department. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the pattern-or-practice investigation Wednesday. On Monday, Garland said the DOJ would pursue a similar investigation into the Louisville Metro Police Department in Kentucky, which has been criticized for the death of Breonna Taylor. Taylor was killed in her apartment last year after police entered using a no-knock warrant and fired 32 bullets. Attorneys for Brown's family have condemned his killing and called for more footage to be released. Authorities have said they have requested that a judge permit the release of the video. Based on what they were allowed to see already, Brown's family has said the police appeared to lack a justification for using deadly force. "There was no time in the 20 seconds that we saw where he was threatening the officers in any kind of way," Chantel Cherry-Lassiter, an attorney, said at a press conference after watching the video, the Associated Press reported . Khalil Ferebee, Brown's son, told reporters after watching the video that his father had been "executed" while trying to save his own life. Pasquotank County Sheriff Tommy Wooten has asked for patience while investigations continue. "This tragic incident was quick and over in less than 30 seconds, and body cameras are shaky and sometimes hard to decipher," Wooten said Monday, according to NBC News. It's not clear how long the FBI's investigation into Brown's death will continue. William Barr, while attorney general under former President Donald Trump, announced the civil rights investigation into Floyd's killing in May 2020. Garland said that investigation was ongoing last week, but did not provide further updates. The civil rights investigations into Brown's and Floyd's killings will look into whether federal laws were broken during those particular arrests. In contrast, pattern-or-practice investigations probe whether police departments routinely flout civil rights laws. Under Trump, pattern-or-practice investigations were largely curtailed, though Garland has shown some eagerness to revamp them. While the Congressional Research Service has found that the Justice Department historically opens about three such investigations a year , Garland has opened two this month. About a third of pattern-or-practice investigations result in significant reforms, the research service found. In addition to the FBI investigation, the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation is also examining Brown's killing.
Multiple recent polls show Americans broadly back the big-ticket spending proposals that have President Joe Biden's first 100 days in office. More Americans say they approve than disapprove of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill Biden signed into law in March. Surveys also find Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure plan is already popular with majorities or pluralities. As he turns the page on his first 100 days in office, Biden is gearing up to unveil yet another massive spending package, this one aimed at addressing family-related issues.	Americans broadly back the big-ticket spending proposals that have defined President Joe Biden 's first 100 days in office, a variety of recent polls show. Surveys show many more Americans approve than disapprove of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill Biden signed into law in March — by far his most significant legislative victory to date. Polls also find Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure plan is already popular with majorities or pluralities of respondents. As he turns the page on his first 100 days on Thursday, Biden is gearing up to unveil yet another massive spending package , this one aimed at addressing family-related issues. The White House has shared few details about that plan — but at least one poll shows a sizable majority of Americans already support it . Since taking over from former President Donald Trump in the midst of the pandemic, Biden has vowed to pursue swift and ambitious actions to lift the U.S. out of the health crisis and overhaul the damaged economy. Despite Republicans' efforts to brand the spending proposals as debt-ballooning boondoggles and harmful tax hikes , Biden's bid so far appears to be paying off. The president's overall approval rating is above water at 53%, buoyed by Americans' support for his handling of Covid and the economy, according to NBC News' latest poll . But Biden's multipronged, multitrillion-dollar spending push is still in its infancy. The $1,400 stimulus checks that many Americans received as part of last month's Covid bill are still being sent out . Key lawmakers are calling for a narrower infrastructure proposal, and others have already balked at the possible tax hikes in the yet-to-be-revealed families plan . "Amorphous spending proposals that promise a lot to people often get a lot of support," said Steve Ellis, president of the nonpartisan budget watchdog Taxpayers for Common Sense. "People see this as a benefit. They hear about the good things. They don't necessarily hear about the problems." Recent polls from NBC , Reuters/Ipsos , CNBC and The Washington Post-ABC News consistently show Biden receiving his highest marks for his handling of the pandemic. The president's Covid response won 69% approval in NBC's national survey, compared with 27% who disapprove. That poll, conducted from April 17 to April 20 among 1,000 U.S. adults, has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.1 percentage points. The latest from Reuters/Ipsos, published Tuesday, had similar findings: 65% approve of Biden's job on the pandemic, while 29% disapprove. The national opinion poll surveyed 4,423 adults from April 12 to April 16. It has a credibility interval — described as a measure of the poll's precision — of 2 percentage points for the full sample, Reuters said. Polls show Americans still see the coronavirus as one of the most pressing issues facing the country. They also are more likely to look to the government for solutions, according to NBC's latest: Fifty-five percent of respondents said the government should do more to solve problems and help meet the peoples' needs, versus 41% who said it's doing too much. Biden stressed from the start that his administration's ability to fight Covid depended on the passage of the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, dubbed the American Rescue Plan. "Absent additional government assistance, the economic and public health crises could worsen in the months ahead," the White House said on the day Biden was inaugurated . The legislation included several sweeping spending measures , including sending direct payments of $1,400 to most U.S. adults, $350 billion in aid to state and local governments and an extension of federal unemployment benefits. Since Biden took office, the U.S. has significantly ramped up vaccine distribution and vaccination rates. Asked in the Post-ABC poll about the stimulus package itself, 65% of respondents said they supported it, versus 31% who opposed it. The survey was based on phone interviews with a random national sample of 1,007 adults conducted from April 18 to April 21. It has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.5 percentage points. In NBC's poll, 46% of respondents said the Covid package is a good idea, a plurality that far outweighs the 25% who called it a bad idea and the 26% who had no opinion. Biden's infrastructure proposal, which in its initial form comes with a price tag of more than $2 trillion , is also popular among Americans, polls show. The package would fund a range of projects that go far beyond merely repairing roads, bridges, ports and other structures that some refer to as "traditional" transportation infrastructure. The White House frames the plan as a forward-looking investment that will address climate change, the rise of China, racial injustice and more. A Monmouth University poll published Monday found that nearly two-thirds of respondents back the plan, as well as the idea of paying for it, in part, by hiking the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% . Nearly half of those polled by Monmouth said the federal government isn't spending enough on transportation infrastructure, 49%, compared with 23% who said the government is spending the right amount and 14% who said it's spending too much. Monmouth's poll was conducted by phone from April 8 to April 12 with 800 U.S. adults, and the results carry a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.5 percentage points. CNBC's latest All-America Survey, which polled 802 adults nationwide from April 8 to April 11 and has a plus-or-minus 3.5 point margin of error, found that only a slight plurality support the infrastructure plan and the corporate tax increases. But Americans overwhelmingly support nearly all the details of the plan when presented with them individually, the poll found. Infrastructure investment is historically popular among both major political parties. But Republicans, and some moderate Democrats, have pushed for Biden to significantly pare back the sweeping package. A group of GOP senators last week put forward a counteroffer that costs less than one-third of Biden's proposal . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has slammed the Biden plan as a " Trojan horse " for a progressive agenda. But the survey results suggest that at this early stage, the White House's ambitious outline resonates with large chunks of the country. "The Biden administration's presumption that spending programs are popular is borne out by these poll numbers," Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a press release Monday. "The key to maintaining this level of support is whether Americans can point to direct benefits in their own lives once those plans are put into action." Ellis told CNBC that at this point "there is not a lot to necessarily attack or go after." "The devil is going to be in the details on these," Ellis said. In a joint address to Congress on Wednesday night, Biden is expected to lay out another massive spending plan focused on family issues. The details are unclear, but Monmouth's survey suggests Americans nevertheless have an appetite for more government spending. The proposal will reportedly focus on expanding child care, paid leave, universal pre-K education and other priorities and will cost roughly $1.5 trillion, NBC reported, citing sources familiar with the discussions. Reports also say Biden may seek to fund the plan by raising taxes on millionaire investors , pushing the tax on capital gains to 39.6% from 20% for those Americans earning more than $1 million. Monmouth's survey asked: "Biden is also expected to propose a large spending plan to expand access to healthcare and childcare, and provide paid leave and college tuition support. In general, would you support or oppose this plan?" Sixty-four percent of respondents said they supported it, while 34% opposed it and just 2% said they did not know. Multitrillion-dollar spending plans were not always viewed as political winners, Ellis said. He compared the current moment to the 2008 financial crisis, saying that when leaders were crafting recovery plans then, "there was a recognition that a trillion dollars is a threshold that we don't want to cross." But the Covid packages, first passed last year by Trump, "blew that away," Ellis said. "Once you cross that threshold, it becomes normalized," he said. "Most people have no sense of a trillion anything, much less a trillion dollars."
President Biden will call on Congress to pass $1.8 trillion in investments and tax credits aimed toward children and families. Biden will pitch the new spending plan before a joint session of Congress less than a month after he issued a sweeping $2 trillion infrastructure proposal. The new proposal, which includes about $1 trillion in investments and $800 billion in tax credits over a decade, will be fully offset in 15 years in part by raising the amount of taxes paid by the richest Americans, the White House said.	President Joe Biden on Wednesday will pitch Congress on $1.8 trillion in new spending and tax credits aimed toward children, students and families, senior administration officials said. Biden will unveil the massive new package less than a month after the White House issued a sweeping proposal to spend more than $2 trillion over eight years on infrastructure and other projects. Together, the plans comprise the Biden administration's vision to overhaul the U.S. economy as the nation seeks to recover from, and look beyond, the coronavirus pandemic. The new proposal, which includes about $1 trillion in investments and $800 billion in tax credits over a decade, will be fully offset in 15 years in part by raising the amount of taxes paid by the richest Americans, the White House said. Here's some of what the new plan calls for: "These are investments that we can't afford not to make as a country," a senior administration official said Tuesday night in a conference call with reporters. To fund the programs and tax perks, the proposal would, in part, reverse key pieces of the 2017 tax-cut law, the key legislative achievement of former President Donald Trump's first year in office. The Biden administration's new spending plan would hike the top income tax rate to 39.6% for the wealthiest Americans. That rate had been cut to 37% for married couples with over $600,000 in taxable income as part of the 2017 law . The plan would also seek to close a series of tax loopholes, and raise taxes on capital gains to 39.6% for households making more than $1 million. The Biden administration maintains that under the new plan, no one making $400,000 a year or less will see their taxes go up. Biden is set to detail the plan Wednesday night, during an in-person address before a joint session of Congress that also lays out his administration's broader legislative priorities. The event comes on the eve of Biden's 100th day in office.
Federal investigators executed search warrants at the Manhattan apartment and office of Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City. Giuliani has been the personal lawyer of former President Donald Trump. The searches were conducted as part of a criminal investigation into Giuliani's dealings in Ukraine, The New York Times first reported. Federal prosecutors in New York last year sought approval from top officials at the Department of Justice to ask for a search warrant for Giuliani's electronic communications.	Federal investigators executed search warrants Wednesday morning at the Manhattan apartment and office of Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who was the personal lawyer of former President Donald Trump , NBC News reported. The searches were part of a criminal investigation into Giuliani's dealings in Ukraine, The New York Times reported first Wednesday, citing three people with knowledge of the matter. FBI agents were escorted to Giuliani's apartment by his doorman, a source close to the former mayor told CNBC. They presented Giuliani with a warrant and requested "all electronic devices," the source said. Giuliani gave them one cell phone, one iPad and one laptop, according to the source. The agents left after about 45 minutes, the source added. The warrant for Giuliani's office also authorized the seizure of electronic devices there. A source told NBC that FBI agents also executed a search warrant at the Washington-area home of the Republican lawyer Victoria Toensing, who is close to Giuliani. Toensing — who is married to and law partners with former top Washington, D.C., federal prosecutor Joseph diGenova — represented Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, who himself is the subject of a federal indictment in the United States. The source said no additional warrants were executed Wednesday other than the ones targeting Toensing and Giuliani. The diGenova-Toensing law firm released a statement early Wednesday evening, saying she was told she wasn't a target in the probe. "Ms. Toensing is a former federal prosecutor and Senior Justice Department Official. She has always conducted herself and her law practice according to the highest legal and ethical standards," the statement said. "She would have been happy to turn over any relevant documents. All they had to do was ask. Ms. Toensing was informed that she is NOT a target of the investigation." Giuliani is a former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, the same office that is investigating him. Federal prosecutors in New York last year sought approval from top officials at the Department of Justice to ask for a search warrant for Giuliani's electronic communications, NBC reported . A source familiar with the investigation told NBC on Wednesday that prosecutors had sufficient grounds to obtain a search warrant late last year. But the source said it was just "a matter of timing," suggesting that the Justice Department — which oversees individual U.S. Attorney's offices — may have wanted to wait until the Trump administration ended in January. A lawyer for Giuliani, Robert Costello, said the authorities arrived at the Upper East Side apartment at 6 a.m. and seized electronic devices during the search, The Wall Street Journal reported. The investigation is looking into possible violations of foreign lobbying rules, and the search warrant sought communications between Giuliani and others including conservative columnist John Solomon, Costello told The Journal. Costello called the search "legal thuggery," according to The Journal. Giuliani tweeted Wednesday that he would issue a live statement on WABC-AM Radio in New York at 3 p.m. ET. But he failed to appear on that station as scheduled, and the show at that time, hosted by Dominic Carter, discussed the New York City mayoral race. Giuliani also deleted his tweet. Costello, in a lengthy statement to NBC later Wednesday, accused the Justice Department of a "corrupt double standard," comparing its treatment of Giuliani with "high level democrats whose blatant crimes are ignored, such as Hilary Clinton, Hunter Biden and Joe Biden." Costello's statement also claimed the materials taken are "replete" with information that is protected under attorney-client privilege. A spokesman for Trump did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. The Justice Department and a spokesman for the SDNY declined to comment. Giuliani tried in 2019 to dig up damaging information on Hunter Biden, in connection with the younger Biden's business dealings in Ukraine. The efforts by Giuliani, Trump and others in his orbit to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens — or at least announce an investigation — prompted House Democrats to impeach the former president for the first time. Democrats argued Trump's reelection ambitions prompted the dirt-seeking efforts. The Senate, then held by Republicans, acquitted Trump. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan were known to be reviewing Giuliani's bank records in connection with the investigation of his activities in Ukraine. Giuliani reacted to the investigation last winter, asserting in a furious tweet that the federal investigators were acting as "secret police" to help Biden. "They want to seize my emails. No reason. No wrongdoing. Attorney-Client privilege.?" Giuliani tweeted on Dec. 22. The search was the second time that investigators from the SDNY had raided the property of someone who served as Trump's lawyer. The first was Michael Cohen, whose office and home were searched three years ago this month . Cohen, once a Trump loyalist, later turned against his former boss and pleaded guilty to multiple crimes related to the ex-president and the Trump Organization. Trump and Giuliani both excoriated Cohen following his plea in November 2018 . Cohen is currently cooperating with an ongoing criminal probe of Trump and his business that is being conducted by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. That investigation focuses on possible bank and insurance fraud involving Trump Organization real estate assets, among other issues. In a tweet Wednesday, Cohen reacted enthusiastically to news of the raid on Giuliani's property. "Here we go folks!!!" Cohen tweeted. Andrew Giuliani, the former mayor's son and a former Trump administration official, told CNN last week that he would travel to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, to discuss a possible New York gubernatorial bid with the ex-president. Meanwhile, in Manhattan, journalists and onlookers were still gathered outside of Rudy Giuliani's apartment building as of early Thursday evening, as "It's the Hard Knock Life" from the musical "Annie" blasted from a nearby car. A man driving by asked whom the crowd was waiting for. "Steve Bannon," a woman replied jokingly, referring to Trump's former top advisor and campaign chief. Before he left office, Trump pardoned Bannon, who had been under federal indictment. When he was told that the reporters and photographers were waiting for Giuliani, the man then cracked: "Giuliani got raided today? About time." — CNBC's Amanda Macias and Shepard Smith contributed to this report.
President Biden said he was not told in advance about the FBI's execution of search warrants at the New York City home and office of Rudy Giuliani. The former New York City mayor has served as personal lawyer to former President Trump. Giuliani's lawyer accused the Justice Department of treating the Republican differently than Biden's son Hunter Biden.	President Joe Biden said he was not told in advance about the FBI's execution of search warrants at the New York City home and office of Rudy Giuliani , one of former President Donald Trump 's personal lawyers. "I give you my word, I was not" briefed beforehand, Biden told MSNBC's Craig Melvin in an interview that aired Thursday. "I learned about that last night when the rest of the world learned about it, my word," Biden said of early Wednesday's raids, in which FBI agents seized electronic devices from the former New York mayor and ex-federal prosecutor. "I had no idea this was underway." Biden also underscored that he has not been briefed on the Giuliani probe — which is focused on the latter's dealings in Ukraine — or any other criminal investigation by the Justice Department. The department is known to be probing the tax affairs of Biden's son Hunter. "I made a pledge I would not interfere in any way, order or try to stop any investigation the Justice Department had," Biden said "I'm not asking to be briefed. That's the Justice Department's independent judgment," the president said. Biden blasted Trump for his efforts to get the Justice Department to investigate certain people and issues, and his repeated criticisms of the department's investigations of people linked to Trump, including his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen , his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and GOP operative Roger Stone. "This last administration politicized the Justice Department so badly, so many [prosecutors], so many left because that's not the role — that's not the role of a president to say who should be prosecuted, when they should be prosecuted, who should be not prosecuted," Biden said. "That's not the role of the president. The Justice Department is the people's lawyer, not the president's lawyer." For months after Biden's defeat of Trump in the 2020 election , Giuliani falsely claimed that Biden won only as a result of widespread ballot fraud. Trump's own attorney general, William Barr, has said there was no evidence of such extensive fraud that would have led to Trump's loss. During an interview Thursday with Fox Business, Trump condemned the raid on Giuliani's properties, calling it "a very, very unfair situation." "He just loves this country. And they raid his apartment, it's like, so unfair and such a double -- like a double standard, like I don't think anybody's ever seen before," Trump said. "Rudy is a patriot who loves this country, and I don't know what they're looking for, what they're doing." The investigation of Giuliani by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York — an office he once headed — began while Trump was president and while his hand-picked attorneys general were heading the Justice Department, which oversees U.S. attorneys' offices. Trump himself faces a serious criminal investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. The New York Times reported in December that Giuliani had talked to then-President Trump about receiving a preemptive pardon that would have protected the lawyer from federal criminal prosecution. "Not true," Giulian i told CNBC after that report was published. Giuliani on Thursday retweeted a tweet by John Cardillo that blasted so-called establishment Republicans who are not publicly defending Giuliani, calling them "feckless cucks." On Wednesday, Giuliani lawyer Robert Costello accused what he called the "Biden Justice Department" of a "corrupt double standard" that treated his Republican client harshly while ignoring the alleged "blatant crimes of high-level Democrats including Biden, Hunter Biden and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. "You have not seen the home of Hunter Biden raided by the FBI with search warrants," said Costello, a former top official in the U.S. Attorney's Office in the SDNY. While there decades ago, Costello had overseen criminal cases that employed the use of search warrants and early-morning raids by FBI agents. "This behavior of the Justice Department, enabled by a compliant media, running rough shod over the constitutional rights of anyone involved in, or legally defending, former President Donald J. Trump is becoming the rule, rather than the exception." In 2019, Giuliani engaged in efforts to dig up damaging information about Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine as part of a strategy to harm Joe Biden's campaign for the Democratic nomination for president. Trump was impeached later that year after he pressured the president of Ukraine to announce an investigation of the Bidens. Trump was acquitted by the GOP-controlled Senate.
President Joe Biden's new American Families Plan does not include an expansion of Medicare eligibility or a provision allowing the program to negotiate prices directly with drug companies. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers have urged the president to include the health-care provisions in the second piece of his economic recovery plan. Biden's plan would make permanent premium cuts for people buying insurance on the individual market.	President Joe Biden 's new plan to boost the social safety net would not expand Medicare coverage, an omission that could irk dozens of Democratic lawmakers who urged him to extend the program to more Americans. The White House on Wednesday outlined the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan , the second piece of the president's more than $4 trillion economic recovery program. It calls to expand paid leave and free pre-K, make child care and higher education more affordable, and extend tax credits for families passed as part of the coronavirus relief bill this year. The plan does not include Biden's campaign pledges to create a public health-insurance option and cut the Medicare eligibility age to 60. It calls to put $200 billion into making permanent premium cost cuts for people who buy coverage on the individual market. The policy passed as part of the pandemic aid bill. Dozens of lawmakers from Biden's party have pushed him to lower the Medicare eligibility age as part of the proposal, saying the move would expand coverage to millions more Americans. They have also asked him to allow Medicare to negotiate prices with drug companies to cut costs. The provision did not make the new package. Seventeen senators wrote to Biden on Sunday asking him to include both policies in the families plan. More than 80 House Democrats sent a similar letter to the president on Monday. Biden plans to outline the recovery proposal before a joint session of the Democratic-held Congress on Wednesday night. Asked Tuesday why the administration did not call to lower the Medicare eligibility age or allow for direct drug-price negotiations as part of the plan, a senior administration official pointed to the funding to cut premium costs. The policy is "one of the most impactful investments we can make" to reduce prices and expand coverage, said the official, who declined to be named. "The president has been very, very clear that he remains fully committed to negotiations to reduce prescription drug prices — that, you will hear him reiterate as a very top priority and something he deems urgent," the official said. It is unclear now whether the exclusion of the health-care policies will threaten passage of Biden's plan in Congress. As Republicans have opposed both major expansions of the social safety net and tax increases to pay for them, Democrats may have to approve the proposal on their own through budget reconciliation. Health-care coverage emerged as the most important issue in last year's Democratic primary — even before millions of people lost their private insurance during an economic plunge and deadly pandemic. A wing of White House hopefuls led by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called for a single-payer system to cover all Americans. Biden opted for more gradual expansion, championing a public option and then a Medicare eligibility age of 60. Despite the intense focus on insurance during the campaign and a health crisis that exposed holes in the current system, the White House has not yet put forward those health-care plans. The administration has taken steps to keep people covered during the pandemic. Along with the subsidy expansions passed earlier this year, the federal government opened up a special Obamacare enrollment period to allow Americans to buy plans. The Democrats in Congress who back Medicare expansion have called it a direct tool both to increase insurance coverage and curb inequities in the health-care system. The representatives and senators who wrote to Biden pointed to an estimate that lowering the eligibility age to 60 would allow 23 million more people to qualify for Medicare. Cutting the threshold to 55 would make 42 million more people eligible for the program, lawmakers wrote. Meanwhile, proponents of direct Medicare price negotiations with drug companies say the change would not only cut costs for consumers, but also free up money for the federal government to pay for their coverage.

Eight representatives and senators will meet Thursday afternoon to discuss police reform legislation. Democrats' George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which passed the House, has stalled in the Senate amid Republican opposition. President Joe Biden urged Congress to pass a police reform bill by next month, the first anniversary of Floyd's killing by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.	Lawmakers from both parties joined police reform talks Thursday as Congress tries to craft a bill that can get through a narrowly divided Capitol. Eight senators and representatives discussed policing changes, a congressional aide confirmed to CNBC. The negotiations continue weeks of ongoing discussions involving Sens. Tim Scott, R-S.C., Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., along with members of the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus, another congressional aide familiar with the matter said. Bass is the lead author of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which the Democratic-held House passed last year and for a second time in March. Republicans oppose the bill, which has stalled in a Senate split 50-50 by party. Scott led a Republican proposal that Democrats blocked last year in the Senate, at the time controlled by the GOP. As bills need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, legislation has to garner at least some support from both parties in the chamber. It is unclear what could win support from Democrats and Republicans, who have differing views on how far the federal government should go to root out violence against Black Americans and abuses of power in policing. Asked Thursday when the House may vote on a policing bill, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said "we will bring it to the floor when we are ready." "And we will be ready when we have good, strong bipartisan bill," she told reporters. "And that is up to the Senate and then we will have it in the House. Because it will be a different bill." Scott, Booker and Bass planned to attend the talks Thursday afternoon, NBC News reported. Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., and Pete Stauber, R-Minn., were also set to participate, according to NBC. Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, George Floyd's brother Philonise and other family members of victims of police violence separately met Thursday with Scott and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. George Floyd, a Black man, died in May after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for about nine minutes. Chauvin was convicted on charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter earlier this month. Floyd's death, along with the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman, in Louisville, Kentucky, last year, sparked the biggest outcries for racial justice and police reform in the U.S. in decades. During his first joint address to Congress on Wednesday night, President Joe Biden called on lawmakers to pass a policing bill by the first anniversary of Floyd's death next month. "The country supports this reform and Congress should act," the president said. He has backed the House-passed legislation. The bill approved by Democrats aims to ban chokeholds, carotid holds and no-knock warrants at the federal level, and would tie state and local police funding to those departments barring the practices. It seeks to weaken so-called qualified immunity, which shields officers from many civil lawsuits, and aims to make it easier to prosecute police. Scott's plan last year called for more limited bans on chokeholds and no-knock warrants. His party at the time resisted efforts to change qualified immunity rules. Democrats called his bill inadequate. In recent weeks, the senator has reportedly floated a compromise that would make departments rather than individual officers the subject of civil lawsuits. Neither the Democratic nor Republican proposals would cut police funding. Activists and many progressive lawmakers have called since Floyd's death to redirect some money from law enforcement to social services. Many major U.S. cities have either reformed policing practices or reduced funding for police in the last year. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
Federal agencies are investigating at least two mysterious incidents on U.S. soil with some hallmarks of the "Havana syndrome." Lawmakers on the House and Senate Armed Services Committee confirmed to NBC News on Thursday that they were briefed in April on the investigation. In 2016, U.S. diplomats and their support staff stationed in Havana reported hearing strange sounds, steady pulses of pressure in their heads and a number of other bizarre physical sensations. In some cases, diplomats noticed a sharp deterioration in their hearing and vision.	WASHINGTON — Federal agencies are investigating at least two mysterious incidents on U.S. soil with some hallmarks of the "Havana syndrome," invisible attacks reported by American diplomats based in Cuba. Lawmakers on the House and Senate Armed Services Committee confirmed to NBC News on Thursday that they were briefed in April on the investigation. One of the unexplained attacks, reported by CNN , occurred in November near the Ellipse, the oval lawn south of the White House. The person who was sickened by the attack is a National Security Council official, people told CNN. Earlier on Thursday, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers she would work to provide Congress with more information on such investigations after she was asked about the reported attacks. But she was light on details because the information is classified. "I completely understand that getting the information is critical for you to be able to respond to these issues and ensure that you're able to make good decisions," Haines told U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., during testimony before the Senate Committee on Armed Services. "Our concern obviously with the classification is because it's either protecting sources and methods and it's critical to our national security," Haines added. In 2016, U.S. diplomats and their support staff stationed in Havana reported hearing strange sounds, steady pulses of pressure in their heads and a number of other bizarre physical sensations. In some cases, diplomats noticed a sharp deterioration in their hearing and vision. Canadian diplomats serving missions in Havana also reported similar symptoms. Physicians enlisted by the State Department said that brain scans of 21 affected U.S. personnel showed structural changes to the brain that had not been identified or linked to any known disorder. The State Department gradually evacuated most of its diplomatic staff from Havana by 2018. In February, the State Department said that while it investigates the mysterious neurological symptoms reported by American diplomats in Cuba, it will install a new senior-level advisor to manage future incidents. "This advisor will be positioned in a senior role and will report directly to the department's senior leadership to ensure, as I said, that we continue to make significant strides to address this issue and to ensure our people are receiving the treatment they need," State spokesman Ned Price told reporters on Feb. 11 . "We have no higher priority than the safety and the security of U.S. personnel, their families, other U.S. citizens both of course in this country and around the world," he added at the time. Price also said the investigation is a high priority for Secretary of State Antony Blinken and that the matter was one of the first briefings he requested from the transition team.
White House says the U.S. military has begun its withdrawal from Afghanistan. Pentagon proactively deploys temporary security assets to protect forces in the region. Earlier this month, Biden announced a full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, ending America's longest war.	WASHINGTON – The White House confirmed Thursday that the U.S. military has begun its withdrawal from Afghanistan and proactively deployed additional troops and military equipment to protect forces in the region. "Potential adversaries should know that if they attack us in our withdrawal, we will defend ourselves, [and] our partners, with all the tools at our disposal," White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling on Air Force One. "While these actions will initially result in increased forces levels, we remain committed to having all U.S. military personnel out of Afghanistan by Sept. 11, 2021," she said, adding that the Biden administration is intent on a "safe and responsible" exit from the war-torn country. The Pentagon has temporarily provided B-52H Stratofortress aircraft to U.S. Central Command, the combatant command that oversees American operations in the Middle East. A U.S. Navy carrier strike group is also in the region to provide support. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby has previously said that Defense Department leadership will continue to assess the need for additional military capabilities as the departure of U.S. and coalition forces proceeds. Earlier this month, Biden announced a full withdrawal o f U.S. troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, ending America's longest war. The removal of approximately 3,000 U.S. service members coincides with the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which spurred America's entry into lengthy wars in the Middle East and Central Asia. Biden's withdrawal timeline breaks with a proposed deadline brokered last year by the Trump administration with the Taliban . According to that deal, all foreign forces would have had to leave Afghanistan by May 1.
Former Vice President Mike Pence and other Republican leaders who are considered potential contenders for the presidential nomination in 2024 are planning to attend a private donor meeting next week in Texas. The donor gathering is being organized by Karl Rove, a former advisor to President George W. Bush and senior Republican strategist. Notably absent from the speaking agenda is former President Donald Trump, who has publicly and privately blasted Rove.	Former Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and other Republican leaders who are considered potential contenders for the GOP's presidential nomination in 2024 are planning to attend a private donor meeting in Texas next week. The donor gathering, according to multiple people briefed on the matter, including contributors set to attend the meeting, is being organized at least in part by Karl Rove, a former advisor to President George W. Bush and senior Republican strategist. People who declined to be named in this story did so in order to speak about a private matter. The schedule lists Pence, Christie, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Another potential contender, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., is also set to attend, following his rebuttal to President Joe Biden's congressional address Wednesday. Notably absent from the speaking agenda is former President Donald Trump, who has publicly and privately blasted Rove. The event, called the "Texas Victory Committee Donor Appreciation Conference," is scheduled to take place May 7 in Austin, according to an agenda first obtained by CNBC. It's set to take place at the Omni Barton Creek Resort. A Pompeo advisor confirmed to CNBC that the former secretary of State "will be attending and leading off the speakers at Karl Rove's event." Representatives for most of the other Republicans who are mentioned in this story and are scheduled to attend did not respond to requests for comment. It would mark one of the first times that some of the GOP's top financiers get to hear from several contenders who could run for president on the Republican ticket against Biden in the next election. Rove's role in helping organize the event suggests that the veteran, deeply connected Republican strategist is introducing his Texas donor network to those potential contenders. Rove co-founded the Republican super PAC American Crossroads, which raised over $80 million during the 2020 election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Data from the Center for Responsive Politics shows that the PAC spent over $75 million against Democrats that cycle. DeSantis, Scott and Rubio are up for reelection to their respective offices in 2022, which makes the gathering even more crucial as they court donors. National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Rick Scott, R-Fla., is also scheduled to be at the donor event. An NRSC spokesman hinted that focus of the discussions will be on the upcoming midterm elections and taking on Biden's agenda. "Chairman Scott looks forward to joining Senator Cornyn in Texas next week to talk about our efforts to win back the Senate and fight back against the Democrats' radical agenda," Chris Hartline, a spokesman for the NRSC, told CNBC on Thursday. Some of the possible nominees attending the Rove gathering were also recently in Florida during multiple donor retreats, including events that took place at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, is expected to first welcome donors to the retreat. The itinerary says Pompeo will be first interviewed. Pence will then be interviewed, followed by others speaking in front of donors with Rubio, DeSantis, Christie and Cotton, among others.
Biden pledged to build a diverse Cabinet that would "look like America," and is so far delivering on that promise with a higher share of Senate-confirmed women and nonwhite appointees than recent predecessors. The administration reached its latest goal of 200 million vaccine shots in arms in 100 days. S&P 500 gains during Biden's first 100 days are stronger than those of any president going back to at least the Eisenhower administration. Biden's approval rating sits at 57% after 100 days, according to Gallup data.	In his first 100 days in office, President Joe Biden signed into law a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, put forward a multitrillion-dollar plan to overhaul the economy and unilaterally reversed course on many of his predecessor's policies. Biden took the reins from former President Donald Trump amid the coronavirus pandemic and under a cloud of nationwide social and political unrest. When he took office Jan. 20, Biden vowed to shepherd the nation through an unprecedented "winter of peril" and set it on a path toward unity. As he approached his 100th full day on the job, Biden this week declared that America is "leading the world again." Here's a look at what's happened in Biden's first 100 days. Even before taking office, Biden pledged to build a diverse Cabinet that would "look like America." He's living up to that commitment, according to Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a presidential scholar and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has been tracking Biden's appointees. The Biden administration is pacing ahead of recent predecessors with a greater share of Senate-confirmed women and nonwhite appointees at the 100-day mark than former presidents Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush had at their 300-day marks, according to Brookings' tracker . The data was last updated on Wednesday and covers confirmations to the 15 departments in the line of presidential succession, and excludes some departments such as U.S. attorneys as well as military appointments. The high-profile positions that minorities have been appointed to also reflect Biden's commitment to diversity, Tenpas said. "It's not just that the numbers are showing he's appointed more women and nonwhites, but he's putting them in positions they've never occupied before," she said. Biden's Cabinet includes Lloyd Austin, the country's first Black Defense secretary; Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay person to hold a Cabinet position; Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet secretary; Janet Yellen, the first woman to head the Treasury Department; and Xavier Becerra, the first Latino secretary of Health and Human Services. Historically, Tenpas said, women and minorities have often been appointed to less-visible positions, such as with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Housing and Urban Development and Labor Department. The first 100 days are typically a preliminary look at administration appointments, Tenpas noted. A president's second 100-day period is often more productive in terms of Senate confirmations, which will be another opportunity to check in on Biden's diversity pledge. Biden took office amid the peak of the Covid crisis, when the country was reporting nearly 200,000 Covid cases and more than 3,000 deaths per day. He set an initial goal of 100 million vaccine shots administered in 100 days, which drew criticism for being too conservative. The White House reached that mark in 58 days and set a new target of 200 million shots, which was surpassed on day 92. More than half of U.S. adults have received at least one dose, according to Centers for Disease Prevention and Control and Prevention data, and all are now eligible to be vaccinated. But the pace of daily shots has slid in recent weeks, down to an average of 2.6 million daily reported vaccinations from a peak of 3.4 million in mid-April. The major stock market indexes have soared during Biden's tenure, with S&P 500 gains during his first 100 days stronger than those of any president going back to at least the 1950s and the Eisenhower administration. Bolstered by record levels of stimulus, the index has risen by 25% since Election Day, part of a continued rally that began in late March 2020 after the coronavirus crash, and has shown few signs of slowing down since. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 23.9% over that period and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has climbed 26.2%. The Biden rally hit a blip when news broke on April 22 that the president is planning a capital gains tax hike on the wealthy, with the S&P 500 and Dow closing down nearly a full percentage point each. Stocks quickly recovered their losses, though, and the White House brushed off a question related to investors' concern about the tax proposal. "I've been doing this long enough not to comment on movements in the stock market," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a press briefing on April 23, adding "but I did see data, factually, that it went back up this morning." The market has been somewhat volatile under Biden, at least by historical standards. The S&P 500 rose or fell by 1% or more on 31 of the days between the Election Day and Biden's 100th day, compared with five days under Trump's initial period in the White House. Considering the political moment he stepped into, Biden's approval rating has so far been strong. But it's unclear whether his numbers will stay above water, as he and his party gear up for a series of major policy fights that could define the rest of his presidency. Biden's approval rating sits at 57% after 100 days, according to Gallup data, making him way more popular than Trump was. But that's not saying much: Trump's rating at this point – 41% – was 14 points lower than any other president in Gallup's history. The president's Republican predecessor maintained historically low approval numbers throughout his one term in office, never cracking the 50% threshold, Gallup polling shows . Compared with other presidents, Biden's rating is less impressive. He's ranked third-lowest of any president since Dwight Eisenhower at the 100-day mark, according to Gallup. Americans tend to give Biden his lowest marks on his handling of China, guns and immigration. Still, it's notable that Biden is garnering positive ratings at a time of extreme political polarization . Gallup's latest survey shows Biden with just 11% approval among Republicans, but he nets 58% approval from independents. At this point in Trump's presidency, just 37% of independents gave him a thumbs up, Gallup shows. Biden's approval appears to be buoyed largely by his administration's decision to focus intently on Covid from Day 1. Americans still see the coronavirus as one of the most pressing issues facing the country, and several polls show Biden receiving highest marks for his handling of the pandemic. Biden pushed hard for Congress to pass the $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan, which many more Americans support than oppose. But there's also more of an appetite for the sort of big-ticket government spending that the administration has put forward. Fifty-five percent of respondents in a recent NBC News survey , for instance, said the government should do more to solve problems and help meet the peoples' needs, versus 41% who said it's doing too much. Even before the White House detailed Biden's latest spending plan — a $1.8 trillion package aimed at helping children, students and families — nearly two-thirds of respondents in a Monmouth University poll said they backed the idea. Experts say it makes sense that Biden's economic proposals — presented in their loftiest, most ambitious form — seem to resonate with Americans. But those plans are bound to change drastically once lawmakers get ahold of his agenda, and it's unclear what Congress will be able to pass. Democrats hold a slim majority in the House, and a razor-thin advantage in the Senate. The filibuster rules in the Senate requires 60 votes for much legislation to be passed, and Democrats' ability to bypass that hurdle through budget reconciliation can be used only sparingly. Biden has repeatedly said he seeks bipartisan input, while stressing that inaction on his agenda is not an option. But there's little indication that Republicans will support anything like Biden's plans in their current form. In addition, some moderate-to-conservative-leaning Democrats, such as Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, are already voicing skepticism about the spending push.
The investment funds of two U.S. universities, Duke and Vanderbilt, own significant chunks of stock in the mysterious company valued at $100 million by the stock market despite owning only a tiny New Jersey deli. Duke's and Vanderbilt's shares in Hometown International were acquired by their Hong Kong-based arms under the direction of Maso Capital Partners, itself a Hong Kong entity that is an investor in the deli-owning company. A third American university, Rutgers, pays $1,100 per month in rent for office space on Mantua Avenue next to the Paulsboro, New Jersey, deli to an entity whose partners include the CEO of the deli company.	The investment funds of two U.S. universities, Duke and Vanderbilt, own significant chunks of stock in the mysterious company valued at $100 million by the stock market despite owning only a tiny New Jersey deli. Duke's and Vanderbilt's shares in Hometown International were acquired by their Hong Kong-based arms under the direction of Maso Capital Partners , itself a Hong Kong entity that is an investor in the deli-owning company, financial filings reveal. The shares of Duke and Vanderbilt, among the biggest stakes in Hometown International, were acquired in the past year as part of what financial filings indicate is an effort to use Hometown International — as well as a shell company called E-Waste — as vehicles for private companies to become publicly traded on U.S. stock markets through either reverse mergers or similar maneuvers. It is not clear whether Duke and Vanderbilt are among the would-be buyers of shares in E-Waste, which last week announced it was offering to sell stock for $2.5 million. E-Waste, which is tied to people connected to Hometown, and which has borrowed money from the deli owner, has no ongoing business, but despite that has a market capitalization of more than $100 million. Manoj Jain, co-chief investment officer of Maso Capital, has sole voting and investment power for Hometown International shares held by the two universities, according to financial filings. Jain previously worked as a managing director at asset manager firm Och-Ziff, now known as Sculptor Capital Management. The role of Duke and Vanderbilt as Hometown International shareholders was first reported by The Financial Times. Financial records show that the same Duke and Vanderbilt investment vehicles that are shareholders in the deli owner previously had been listed as substantial shareholders along with Maso Capital in Paladin Energy, an Australian company that had uranium mining operations in Africa. They also show that the Duke and Vanderbilt entities hold shares in a so-called special purpose acquisition company, Duddell Street Acquisition Corp ., which Maso Capital created last year and which began trading on NASDAQ. A third American university, Rutgers, pays $1,100 per month rent for office space on Mantua Avenue next to the Paulsboro, New Jersey, deli, CNBC has learned. Paul Morina, CEO of the deli-owning company, is one of the partners in the landlord entity, Mantua Creek Group LLC. The involvement of the three universities with Hometown International and the deli's landlord raises more questions to the mystery surrounding Hometown, whose market capitalization of $100 million reflects — in no way at all — the underlying value of the deli it owns. That deli has had sales of just $35,000 in the 2019 and 2020 combined. Rutgers' space is being used for a study of Paulsboro's drinking water by the university's School of Public Health , which is being conducted with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Rutgers, a public university based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, is paying Mantua Creek Group rent under a 24-month lease that began last September. The Rutgers study's office is at 541 B Mantua Ave., while the Hometown Deli is at 541 A Mantua Ave. Hometown International itself is paying Mantua Creek Group $500 per month for the deli space. The Paulsboro Wrestling Club and the Monster Factory professional wrestling school are located at 541 C Mantua Ave., in a separate building. Morina, the Hometown International CEO, is also the principal of Paulsboro High School and head coach of its renowned wrestling team . A Rutgers spokeswoman said she had no information about how the university chose the location for its office in Paulsboro. The lease agreements with Rutgers and Hometown were signed by a man named James Patten, who works as an analyst for Tryon Capital, a North Carolina company controlled by Peter Coker Sr., the father of the chairman of the deli company, Peter Coker Jr. Patten, who wrestled in high school with Morina, was barred from acting as a stock broker after a series of disciplinary actions , according to FINRA, the entity that regulates broker-dealers. Hometown International's most recent annual report, filed last month, shows that Duke's entity, Blackwell Partners LLC — Series A, holds 1.38 million common stock shares in Hometown International. Duke holds warrants to purchase another 27.6 million shares. Vanderbilt's entity, Star V Partners LLC, holds 663,750 common shares in the company, with warrants to buy another 13.275 million shares. The universities' stakes, which include common shares and warrants, were acquired for about $2 million in total. On paper, those common shares alone now are worth more than $26 million, given Hometown International's recent closing price of $13 per share. But Hometown's stock is thinly traded, at best. For that reason, and because of the lack of any valuable asset other than its existence as a publicly traded company, it is likely impossible for anyone, including Duke and Vanderbilt, to sell their shares in large blocks for anywhere near the current trading price. It is not clear whether Vanderbilt and Duke are among the recent buyers. A spokeswoman for Duke, located in Durham, North Carolina, declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Maso Capital. Vanderbilt, located in Nashville, Tennessee, had no immediate comment when contacted by CNBC. Anders Hall, vice chancellor for investments and chief financial officer at Vanderbilt , previously handled investments at Duke. People connected to Hometown have for weeks refused to return calls and emails seeking comment from CNBC. CNBC in the past two weeks has detailed criminal cases, civil lawsuits and regulatory sanctions against people connected to Hometown International, whose listing on an over-the-counter market was removed last week because of irregularities in its financial filings. Those filings show that the largest shareholders of Hometown International stock include a group of opaque entities in Macao, China, which are located on the same floor in the same office building there. Earlier this week, as a result of CNBC's articles, Hometown International and E-Waste terminated consulting agreements that were paying Peter Coker Sr.'s Tryon Capital $15,000 per month in the case of the deli owner, and $2,500 per month in the case of E-Waste. Another company connected to Coker Sr., TM Medical Properties LLC on its website says it leases space to multiple health-care related entities, including Vanderbilt Medical Center Clinics. Coker Sr.'s Hong Kong-based son, Peter Coker Jr., among other positions has a board seat at Duddell Street Acquisition Corp ., the Maso Capital-linked SPAC firm whose shares last fall began trading on the Nasdaq . Duddell Street Acquisition, whose name reflects the Hong Kong office address of Maso Capital, on its website says it is "a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination."
The Biden administration will restrict travel from India as that country grapples with a gigantic surge in coronavirus cases, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. The policy will take effect Tuesday, May 4, Psaki said. India reported record daily cases and deaths from Covid on Wednesday and Thursday.	The Biden administration will restrict travel from India as that country grapples with a gigantic surge in coronavirus cases, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday. The policy will take effect Tuesday, May 4, Psaki said in a statement. The administration made the decision on the advice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she said. While Covid infections and deaths have been on the decline in the U.S. as millions of Americans get vaccinated each day, India is in the grip of an unprecedented spike in cases. India reported record daily death tolls from Covid on Wednesday and Thursday . The country is averaging about 3,050 Covid deaths per day, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, though media reports indicate the official figure is being understated. India has reported an average of about 357,000 new cases per day over the past seven days — up about 26% from a week ago, Johns Hopkins data shows. The country is battling a highly contagious Covid variant, known as B.1.617, which was first spotted there. The variant, which contains two key mutations that have been found separately in other coronavirus strains, is believed by some to be behind the latest wave of infections. The variant has since been identified in other countries, including the United States. There are few nonstop flights between the U.S. and India. United Airlines is the only major U.S. carrier operating nonstop service between the two countries, with four daily departures to India. Air India has a similar number scheduled for next month, according to aviation data firm Cirium. The new travel order isn't expected to ban flights, but rather non-U.S. citizens or permanent residents who have recently been in India — a similar format as restrictions that have been placed on much travel from the EU, China and Brazil, according to a person familiar with the matter. "If we are going to do this, we ought to be clear about what we're aiming to accomplish," former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said of the new travel restrictions on CNBC's "Closing Bell." "Most of the data shows that they have a negligible impact on transmission of the virus and introduction of the virus into the United States," Gottlieb said. "I can assure you that the variants we're seeing circulating in India, including the new 617 variant, are here in the United States already," he said. The Biden administration, facing bipartisan calls to help India get a grip on the staggering health crisis, announced this week that the U.S. is sending the country more than $100 million worth of Covid supplies, including 1,000 oxygen cylinders, 15 million N95 masks and 1 million rapid diagnostic tests. But lawmakers are still ratcheting up pressure on President Joe Biden to do more for India. In a letter Friday, members of the House Caucus on India and Indian Americans urged Biden to provide the country with additional resources, including vaccines. "Our support for India to help beat back this latest wave is in the U.S. national interest as the pandemic will not end anywhere until it ends everywhere," said the letter, which was signed by two Republicans and two Democrats in the House group. Psaki, talking with reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday afternoon, said two U.S. military planes filled with supplies landed in India that morning, adding that more was coming soon. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reached out to his Indian counterpart in recent days, Psaki noted. Asked about travel from India at a White House briefing on the pandemic earlier Friday, Covid response coordinator Jeff Zients said the U.S. was "continuously monitoring the situation." He added that America was "in very close contact with our foreign counterparts" and that it would "continue to follow the CDC's science-based guidance on travel and other matters." — CNBC's Leslie Josephs contributed to this report. Disclosure: Scott Gottlieb is a CNBC contributor and is a member of the boards of Pfizer, genetic testing start-up Tempus, health-care tech company Aetion Inc. and biotech company Illumina. He also serves as co-chair of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' and Royal Caribbean's "Healthy Sail Panel."
Rep. Kevin Brady suggested that President Joe Biden's proposals to raise tax rates on corporations and the rich are nonstarters for Republicans. "I'm not sure we should be compromising by making America dramatically less competitive than our global competitors," Brady said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." The Texas Republican advocated for "a different approach on how we pay for" Biden's infrastructure plan.	Rep. Kevin Brady, the top tax-writing Republican in the House during the Trump administration, suggested Monday that President Joe Biden 's proposals to raise rates on corporations and the rich are nonstarters. "I'm not sure we should be compromising by making America dramatically less competitive than our global competitors," Brady said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." The Texas Republican, who is retiring at the end of this term after more than two decades in Congress , predicted "there's going to be a real fight over these tax increases" and advocated for "a different approach on how we pay for" Biden's infrastructure plan. Biden last week laid out the second part of his multitrillion-dollar plan to overhaul the U.S. economy in the wake of the devastating coronavirus pandemic. The packages aim to make huge investments in infrastructure, child care and a slew of other projects that will be paid for in part by hiking the top income tax rate to 39.6% and raising the corporate tax rate to 28%. Biden's proposals would reverse some key pieces of the 2017 tax-cut law, which Brady, then the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, helped craft. The $1.5 trillion legislation, which cut taxes for corporations and individuals, became a key achievement of former President Donald Trump's term in office. Brady said Republicans and Democrats in Congress can "absolutely compromise" on an infrastructure plan, which has "always been a bipartisan issue." But "we shouldn't be funding infrastructure on the backs of American workers," Brady said. He proposed that lawmakers should instead start by looking to "recapture" some of the wasted money in the budget and by restoring to their original purpose a number of tax provisions that used to go toward infrastructure but have been subsumed by other issues. Brady also suggested seeking private capital sources to help raise infrastructure funds. "There are some different ways we can approach that to drive funding for infrastructure," Brady said. But Brady appeared to dismiss the prospect of taxing the rich, arguing that the tax code is already "extremely progressive." The Biden administration has called on Republicans to weigh in and offer their own proposals, while stressing that "inaction is not an option." But many Republicans have accused the White House of employing the rhetoric of unity while governing like partisans. Biden in March signed into law a $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill without any GOP support. Democrats hold narrow majorities in both chambers of the bitterly polarized Congress. The Senate is split 50-50 between the two parties, giving Vice President Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. The Senate filibuster, which requires a 60-vote threshold for most legislation to be passed, keeps Democrats from pushing most of their agenda through Congress. But budget reconciliation rules allow for some bills — such as the Covid relief bill in March — to be passed with just a simple majority, and Democrats have more opportunities to use that option before the 2022 midterm elections. Many Democratic lawmakers are pushing for the Senate to end the filibuster — a move that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., warned would lead to a "100-car pileup" in the chamber. But some moderate Democrats, such as West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have also come out against filibuster reform . Manchin and other moderate Democrats, who in a divided Congress wield outsize influence, have also voiced concern with the trillions of dollars in spending proposed by the Biden administration. McConnell on Monday accused Democrats of destroying the limited bipartisanship that led Congress to quickly pass multiple Covid stimulus bills last year. Democrats "just can't resist stretching out the pandemic, using it as a rationale for additional spending," McConnell said in remarks at the University of Louisville. "They want to raise the corporate rate to the highest in the world," McConnell added. "We're not going to revisit the 2017 tax bill." Asked Monday for his prediction on how the fight will play out on Capitol Hill, Brady said, "This is not a done deal by any means." "These are dramatic increases in taxes that have real impacts on jobs here in America. There's no question in my view this is going to sabotage the jobs recovery, it will drive jobs overseas," he said. Raising the corporate tax rate alone "makes America nearly dead last competitively and will drive jobs overseas, so I'm not sure we should be compromising by making America dramatically less competitive than our global competitors." "I think there's going to be a real fight over these tax increases and I predict, at some point I'm hopeful there'll be a middle ground that we find, both on infrastructure and a different approach on how we pay for it," Brady said.
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said state residents who get their first coronavirus vaccination in May will be eligible for a free beer at select breweries. The Garden State is hardly the first to propose an outside-the-box incentive for people to get vaccinated. The initiative comes as a significant number of Americans say they are still not willing to get vaccinated for Covid.	New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on Monday announced a new bid to boost coronavirus vaccinations: Receive your first dose in May and get a free beer. "We're not going to be afraid to try new things," Murphy said as he unveiled the new program, dubbed "Shot and a Beer," at a press briefing. Thirteen New Jersey-based breweries are participating in the program — which is only available to state residents ages 21 years and older, Murphy specified. Those New Jerseyans will have to show their vaccine cards as proof before receiving their reward, the Democratic governor said. The breweries themselves are footing the bill for the free drinks, said Murphy, who suggested more beer-makers could soon be added to the list. The breweries currently participating are: Battle River Brewing, Bradley Beer Project, Bolero Snort Brewing Company, Brix City Brewing Company, Carton Brewing Company, Flounder Brewing Company, Flying Fish Brewing Company, Gaslight Brewery and Restaurant, Hackensack Brewing Company, Kane Brewing Company, Little Dog Brewing Company, Magnify Brewing Company and River Horse Brewing Company. The program came from the New Jersey Department of Health in partnership with the Brewer's Guild of New Jersey. The Garden State is hardly the first to propose an outside-the-box incentive for people to get vaccinated. West Virginia's Republican Gov. Jim Justice last week announced an initiative to give $100 savings bonds to younger state residents who get vaccinated. Connecticut is offering its own alcoholic incentive with its "Drinks On Us" campaign : Residents who get fully vaccinated and show their vaccine cards at certain restaurants will score a free drink between May 19 and May 31. Incentive or no, vaccine rates are rising. More than 29% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, according to Johns Hopkins University, and cases and deaths from Covid are on the decline. But a significant number of Americans say they are not willing to get vaccinated. A Monmouth University poll published in mid-April found that about 1-in-5 Americans say they won't get the shot. That's prompting health officials and leaders at every level of government to urge more people to seek out and receive their vaccinations. The "Shot and a Beer" campaign is just one piece of New Jersey's broader slate of programs aimed at returning the state to a more normal summer as the fight against the pandemic continues. Murphy announced the free-beer plan after detailing the "Grateful for the Shot" initiative, which makes it possible for congregants to go from religious services directly to vaccination sites. It's "perhaps at the other end of the spectrum" of incentives, Murphy said.
President Joe Biden said he is raising the annual U.S. refugee cap to 62,500 entrants for the fiscal year. That number revises upward the much lower figure of 15,000 refugee admissions set under the Trump administration, which Biden said "did not reflect America's values." Biden also said he plans to set a cap of 125,000 refugee admissions for the following fiscal year.	President Joe Biden will raise the annual U.S. refugee cap to 62,500 entrants for the fiscal year, revising the much lower number set under the Trump administration that "did not reflect America's values," he said Monday. "It is important to take this action today to remove any lingering doubt in the minds of refugees around the world who have suffered so much, and who are anxiously waiting for their new lives to begin," the president said in a statement. Biden also said he plans to set a cap of 125,000 refugee admissions for the following fiscal year. The Biden administration faced immense pressure from Democrats and activists to quickly raise the refugee cap from the historically low limit of 15,000 set under former President Donald Trump . After Biden signaled in mid-April he would keep the Trump-era cap in place, lawmakers in his own party publicly tore into the Democratic president . "President Biden has broken his promise to restore our humanity," Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said at the time. Soon after the backlash, the White House said that there was "confusion" in its messaging and vowed to address the refugee cap by May 15. Republicans, meanwhile, have slammed Biden's handling of a surge of migrant arrivals along the U.S.-Mexico border. GOP lawmakers urged the administration to reinstate some of Trump's strict immigration policies that Biden canceled when he took office. Media outlets also spoke out against the administration for limiting press access at reportedly overwhelmed border facilities at the height of the surge. Biden's statement Monday afternoon said the U.S. refugee program "embodies America's commitment to protect the most vulnerable, and to stand as a beacon of liberty and refuge to the world." "It's a statement about who we are, and who we want to be. So we are going to rebuild what has been broken and push hard to complete the rigorous screening process for those refugees already in the pipeline for admission," the president said. But "the sad truth," he noted, "is that we will not achieve 62,500 admissions this year." "We are working quickly to undo the damage of the last four years. It will take some time, but that work is already underway. We have reopened the program to new refugees. And by changing the regional allocations last month, we have already increased the number of refugees ready for departure to the United States," he said. Biden also acknowledged that his goal for next year of 125,000 refugee admissions "will still be hard to hit." "We might not make it the first year. But we are going to use every tool available to help these fully-vetted refugees fleeing horrific conditions in their home countries," he said. "This will reassert American leadership and American values when it comes to refugee admissions."

Shell company E-Waste disavowed its own sky-high stock market valuation of $106 million, three days after an identical move by the mysterious corporation that owns just a single New Jersey deli. The deli company, Hometown International, has multiple connections to E-Waste. Each company has a market capitalization of about $100 million, which does not reflect either company's meager business operations. "The management of E-Waste Corp. ... disavows the price of its publicly quoted stock on the OTC Markets under the trading symbol 'EWST,'" the company said in an 8-K filing with the SEC.	The shell company E-Waste Corp. on Monday disavowed its own sky-high stock market valuation of $106 million, three days after an identical move by the mysterious corporation that owns just a single small New Jersey deli. The deli company, Hometown International , has multiple connections to E-Waste , which has no actual business operations. Both companies are thinly traded, at best, on the over-the-counter market. The back-to-back disavowals of their respective market capitalizations in Securities and Exchange Commission filings came after more than two weeks of articles by CNBC detailing legal and regulatory issues surrounding people and entities connected to Hometown International and E-Waste. They also come as a Hong Kong-based firm, Maso Capital, continues trying to position both companies as vehicles for acquisition by privately held companies to become publicly traded on U.S. stock markets. In its filing Monday with the SEC , the management of E-Waste said it "disavows the price of its publicly quoted stock on the OTC Markets under the trading symbol 'EWST.'" "Management is aware of no basis to support the Company's stock price, based upon its revenue or assets," the filing said in language that mirrored that of Hometown International's filing last Friday. Last week, both Hometown International and E-Waste on the same day killed consulting agreements with a North Carolina firm controlled by the father of Hometown's chairman. The moves, which cited "recent negative press," were praised by Maso Capital's founder, Manoj Jain, who said, "We look forward to both public companies taking forward their stated acquisition plans." E-Waste last month raised $2.5 million from several institutional investors in a private placement offering, according to Monday's filing. "Management disclosed that the proceeds from this private placement would be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, and to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, engage in a business combination with a private entity whose business represents an opportunity for the Company's shareholders," the filing said. The filing was signed by E-Waste President John Rollo, whose company in November declared a net loss of almost $58,000 for the prior nine months. A Grammy Award-winning recording engineer, the 66-year-old Rollo last year was working as a patient transporter in a New Jersey hospital, according to another recent E-Waste financial. E-Waste's stock price closed at $8.50 per share on Monday, with no trades recorded on the Pink market, according to OTC Markets Group. With 12.5 million shares outstanding, E-Waste has a market capitalization of $106.25 million. Hometown International stock, which also trades on the Pink market, closed at $13.40 per share, with just 2,866 out of the nearly 7.8 million common shares outstanding changing hands in trading. That stock price gives the company a market cap of $97.85 million. That is many times greater than the just $35,000 or so in sales of its Hometown Deli in Paulsboro, New Jersey, in the past two years combined. On April 21, OTC Markets Group demoted Hometown International to its Pink market from the more prestigious OTCQB platform because of "irregularities" in its public disclosures. The stock also had a "buyer beware" label slapped on it by OTC Markets , which told CNBC at the time that it was also examining the financial filings of E-Waste. It remains unclear why anyone — either close to both companies or not — would have paid much at all for either stock in the past year, much less bid them up in value to their current valuations, given their lack of any significant business. Both companies in their public disclosures have bluntly stated that there is no guarantee they will be able to survive in their current state. E-Waste ostensibly was created to develop an e-waste recycling business in 2012, but it discontinued those efforts and has not declared any revenue for years. A key figure connected to both companies is Peter Coker Sr., the father of Hometown International's chairman, Peter Coker Jr. The elder Coker is an investor in Hometown International. Last year, after a Macao, China-based entity called Global Equity Limited bought 6 million restricted shares in E-Waste, a controlling stake, E-Waste's registration and phone number changed to Coker Sr.'s office in Carrboro, North Carolina, and began paying $250 per month for a one-year lease there. Global Equity is also the biggest shareholder in Hometown International. E-Waste also last year began paying Coker Sr.'s Tryon Capital $2,500 per month under a consulting agreement. And Coker Sr. personally lent E-Waste $255,000 at an annual interest rate of 8%, according to financial filings. Tryon Capital also was collecting another $15,000 per month from a consulting agreement with Hometown International. Those consulting deals were terminated last week after scrutiny of the arrangements by CNBC. In late November, E-Waste issued a promissory note to Hometown International for $150,000 at an interest rate of at least 6% annually, according to an SEC filing. That note indicates Hometown International lent the shell company that amount. The promissory note was acknowledged by Hometown International CEO Paul Morina, who is the principal at Paulsboro High School, whose renowned wrestling team he also coaches. Coker Sr. has a tangled legal history, which includes allegations of hiding money from creditors and civil allegations of fraud , all of which he denied. Coker Sr.'s business partners include Peter Reichard. A decade ago, Reichard was convicted of using Tryon Capital in a scheme that employed bogus consulting deals to hide illegal campaign donations to Bev Perdue, a Democrat who was elected governor of North Carolina in 2008. Coker Sr. was not implicated or charged in that case.
House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy admitted that he rented a room for several months from pollster and corporate advisor Frank Luntz. But McCarthy, during an appearance on Fox News, denied there was any conflict of interest in sharing a home with his longtime pal Luntz, a consultant for Republican causes. McCarthy's admission came a day after outraged Fox News host Tucker Carlson first reported the California Republican's living arrangement with Luntz in downtown Washington.	Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House, admitted Tuesday that he rented a room for "a couple of months" from GOP pollster and corporate advisor Frank Luntz. But McCarthy, during an appearance on Fox News, denied there was any conflict of interest in sharing a home with his longtime pal Luntz, a commucations consultant for Republican causes and corporations. McCarthy's chuckling confirmation came a day after outraged Fox News host Tucker Carlson first reported the California Republican's curious living arrangement with Luntz in downtown Washington. McCarthy told Fox News he paid "fair market rate" for the room to Luntz. Records reviewed by CNBC indicate that Luntz bought that three-bedroom, 3½-bath, 1,740 square-foot penthouse apartment in 2018 for more than $1 million. The pad boasts "Italian appliances" and a "rooftop patio," according a real estate site. Carlson had expressed wide-eyed astonishment Monday night that Luntz — who has been a verbal target of his recently — was acting as McCarthy's landlord. Carlson's ire stems from his belief that Luntz is "effectively a Democrat" — whom Carlson says also effectively "lobbies on behalf of some of the world's most left-wing corporations" — while having the ear of " the leadership of the Republican Party." "His views, make no mistake, bear no resemblance whatsoever to the views of actual Republican voters," Carlson fumed on his show. Carlson began teeing off on Luntz last week after the pollster was quoted by Axios as saying "Republicans are more pro-immigrant than elites realize." Carlson said on his show he was tipped off to McCarthy staying with Luntz, but that McCarthy's spokeswoman all but chuckled in first denying the tip Monday morning. She said McCarthy either slept on his office couch or rented hotel rooms when in Washington, according to Carlson. But that spokeswoman two hours later confirmed the tip in a text to Carlson's show, saying, "Because of the [coronavirus] pandemic, McCarthy has rented a room in Washington at a fair market price from Frank." Carlson showed the message on his show and then said, "Now you know why they listen to Frank Luntz and not you." When Fox and Friends host Steve Doocy asked McCarthy on Tuesday morning about staying with Luntz — "What's up with that?" — the lawmaker smiled. "I didn't know how this was controversial," McCarthy said. "Frank has been a friend of mine for more than 30 years." McCarthy then chalked up his use of Luntz's residence to Democrats changing around offices in the House of Representatives — not to the Covid-19 pandemic, as his spokeswoman told Carlson. "As Democrats took over they started changing the House around," McCarthy told Doocy. Democrats won majority control in the House two years ago. So it is not clear how a reconfiguration of offices then led to McCarthy stay with Luntz more recently. "Yeah, I rented a room from Frank for a couple of months, but don't worry, I'm going back to where I am normally ... back to the couch in my office," McCarthy told Doocy. "We paid far-market rent," McCarthy said. CNBC has reached out to McCarthy's office to ask how long exactly he stayed with Luntz, and what rate he paid the pollster. "Frank's not a lobbyist, Frank's a friend," McCarthy told Doocy when the Fox News host pointed out Carlson's criticisms. "I don't see that there's any problem there along that line." Luntz, a frequent guest on CNBC, did not immediately return a request for comment. — Additional reporting by CNBC's Brian Schwartz and Christina Wilkie
President Joe Biden's allies in the business community have been helping the White House try to coax the private sector into supporting  the administration's climate change agenda. Several business leaders who are working with the White House told CNBC that the effort is a major divergence from what they saw during the Trump administration. "There's no longer the fear of the tweet, which I think was a legitimate fear from a lot of the business leaders in trying to speak out on these issues," said one corporate leader.	President Joe Biden's allies in the business community have been helping the White House try to coax the private sector into supporting the administration's climate change agenda. Several business leaders who are working with the White House told CNBC that the effort is a major divergence from what they saw during the Trump administration. For instance, executives say they are less worried about a tweet from the president if they try to make a push for new climate policies. Former President Donald Trump was known to target corporations that appeared to oppose him on key issues. "There's no longer the fear of the tweet, which I think was a legitimate fear from a lot of the business leaders in trying to speak out on these issues," Hugh Welsh, president of DSM North America, which is a member of the group CEO Climate Dialogue, told CNBC on Monday. Unlike Trump, Biden has proposed an aggressive climate change policy. Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement in 2017 and lifted Obama-era regulations on methane gas, among other actions that could end up hurting the environment. Biden brought the U.S. back into the Paris climate agreement on his Inauguration Day. Biden has also made addressing climate change a key part of his $2 trillion infrastructure plan. Biden's proposal pushes for a $174 billion investment in the electric vehicle market. It's all part of the president's goal to get the country to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Tom Steyer, a billionaire who ran for president during the Democratic primary, is among several business leaders who have been actively engaging the White House and administration leaders on their climate proposals. Steyer has been speaking with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and White House climate advisor Gina McCarthy on the need to work with the private sector on what will likely be one of the president's most expensive initiatives, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Steyer spent millions to defeat Trump and has invested in climate change initiatives. He has a net worth of $1.4 billion, according to Forbes. He was also a speaker at Morgan Stanley's annual climate conference, this person noted. Steyer told executives and investors at the meeting that they shouldn't invest in fossil fuel companies, as a way to combat climate change. This person declined to be named in order to discuss private matters. Representatives for Morgan Stanley did not respond to requests for comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment before publication. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the CEO Climate Dialogue have also been engaging the White House on climate initiatives. The Chamber opposes Biden's plan to raise corporate taxes, but it backs an infrastructure overhaul. The CEO Climate Dialogue has almost two dozen members including companies from Wall Street and the energy sector. The goal of the organization is to promote the use of the private sector and a more market-based approach to securing net-zero emissions by 2050. Welsh, of CEO Climate Dialogue, told CNBC that the group has been in touch with the Biden White House to help improve relations with corporate leaders. "The group has been involved with Gina McCarthy and some of the others in, I guess, rebuilding relationships with the White House after the last four years," Welsh said. Marty Durbin, president of the Chamber of Commerce's Global Energy Institute, told CNBC that the group has been in touch with McCarthy and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. Durbin said the chamber has been trying to encourage Granholm and members of Congress to fully fund climate-based research and development projects. The group also has been looking to encourage the new administration to work with the private sector on green policy proposals. "We've got to figure out how do we allow the private sector to be in a position to finance, deploy and commercialize these technologies. That's how we are going to see emission reductions at the end of the day," Durbin said. Members of a fundraising group called Clean Energy for Biden are also acting as a bridge to the private sector. Dan Reicher, a co-chairman of the organization, told CNBC that he helped outline a spending proposal to increase energy output from the nation's dams. The document, which was sent to the White House and endorsed by nearly a dozen organizations and trade associations, says that only 2,500 of the approximately 90,000 dams in the United States generate electricity. "If fully enacted, this $63.07 billion proposal for spending, over 10 years, will create approximately 500,000 good-paying jobs, restore over 20,000 miles of rivers enhancing their climate resilience, and secure more than 80 gigawatts of existing renewable hydropower and 23 gigawatts of electricity storage," the proposal says. It also calls for Biden to order the creation of a committee to coordinate on dam improvements and regulatory issues. Reicher said the outline was sent to Phil Giudice and David Hayes, two of Biden's climate policy advisors, and members of Congress, among others. The Clean Energy for Biden group is evolving into 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) nonprofits, both called Clean Energy for America, Reicher added. The Clean Energy for America website said that while backing Biden's climate agenda it will also be "supporting candidates at federal, state, and local level through fundraising, mobilizing the clean energy workforce, and serving as an early resource."
President Joe Biden said Monday that tax increases for millionaires and corporations are fundamental to creating a "fair" economy that rewards work and grows the middle class. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said these same tax hikes would be a red line for congressional Republicans, effectively killing any chance of a deal on infrastructure spending. Biden has an unofficial deadline of May 31 to see if he can find common ground with Republicans on an infrastructure package.	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell toughened their positions Monday over the tax increases for millionaires and corporations that Biden has proposed to fund his sweeping infrastructure and education plans. "We're open to doing a roughly $600 billion package which deals with what all of us agree is 'infrastructure,'" McConnell said at an event in Kentucky. "And to talk about how to pay for that in any way other than reopening the 2017 tax reform bill." Raising the corporate tax rate to 28%, up from 21%, is the linchpin of Biden's proposal to pay for the American Jobs Plan, a massive revamping of the nation's infrastructure and energy sector that would create jobs in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. But McConnell on Monday called the 2017 tax cuts among the most significant domestic accomplishments of the past four years under former President Donald Trump. "We're not going to revisit that," he said. McConnell's insistence on protecting the 2017 tax cuts effectively pours cold water on the best chance that the White House and congressional Republicans had to reach a deal on at least one part of Biden's sweeping domestic agenda. "I don't think there'll be any Republican support, none, zero for the $4.1 trillion grab bag, which has infrastructure in it, but a whole lot of other stuff," said McConnell. But it wasn't just McConnell who drew a line in the sand on Monday. Biden did too, during a visit to a community college in Norfolk, Virginia, where he touted the proposed expansion of pre-kindergarten and community college scholarships, part of his American Families Plan to expand the social safety net. This $1.8 trillion plan would be paid for largely by changes to individual tax laws, including higher income tax rates for the very rich and stiffer enforcement by the IRS. "I come from the corporate capital of the world," said Biden, who hails from the incorporation hub of Delaware. "I'm not anti-corporate, but it's about time they start paying their fair share," he said. "It's about making a choice." "I don't wanna punish anybody, but everybody should chip in, everybody should pay something along the road here. The choice is about who the economy serves, and so I plan on giving tax breaks to the working class folks, and making everybody pay their fair share," said the president. In addition to a return to pre-2017 income tax rates for the highest earners, Biden proposes to expand the IRS' ability to verify individual incomes, to tax capital gains upon death and to increase the capital gains tax rate to nearly 40%, which would match the individual income tax rate. Biden was careful on Monday not to personally vilify the very rich, saying, "They're good people, they're not bad folks." But the president also made it clear that he sees these tax hikes as more than just a necessary evil to fund his big plans: They're a key part of reestablishing a sense of shared responsibility and shared burden across the American economy. "For too long, we've had an economy that gives every break in the world to the folks who need it the least," he said. "It's time to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out." Despite McConnell's hard line, White House officials plan to dedicate additional time this week to lobbying key Republicans in Congress to support the infrastructure overhaul. Biden also plans to host McConnell, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer at the White House on May 12 for a broader discussion on shared priorities. But Democrats in and around the White House acknowledge that Biden has a narrow window of time in which to pass the biggest pieces of his domestic agenda, and they are wary of spending too much time courting Republicans for votes that might never materialize. Veteran Democratic political strategists in Biden's orbit also vividly recall former President Barack Obama's extensive outreach to Republicans in 2009 for support for the Affordable Care Act. Despite months of effort, Obama's signature legislation ultimately failed to garner any GOP votes. According to Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a close Biden ally, there is an unofficial deadline of May 31 for the White House and congressional Republicans to reach a consensus, if one is at all possible. "I believe that President Biden is open to spending the next month negotiating what the possibility is," Coons told Punchbowl News in an interview last month. If no deal has been hammered out by Memorial Day, Coons said, "I think Democrats just roll it up into a big package and move it."
President Joe Biden set the goal of getting 70% of U.S. adults to receive at least one dose of a Covid vaccine by July 4. The White House will also aim to have 160 million adults fully vaccinated by Independence Day, senior administration officials said. The announcement came two months out from the Fourth of July, a date the White House hopes will mark a turning point in the pandemic.	President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced his administration's latest goals in the fight against the coronavirus : getting 70% of U.S. adults to receive at least one dose of a Covid vaccine and having 160 million adults fully vaccinated by July 4. The new vaccination targets came two months out from Independence Day, a date the White House hopes will mark a turning point in the pandemic . "If we succeed in this effort," Biden said at the White House, "then Americans will have taken a serious step toward a return to normal." In a background call with reporters earlier Tuesday, senior administration officials also said the White House will change the way it allocates vaccines to states. Covid vaccines that go unused or unwanted by some states will be redistributed to others, officials said. In order to administer tens of millions more inoculations in the next 61 days, the president will take additional steps to encourage more people to get vaccinated and make it easier for them to do so, officials said. Biden will direct thousands of local pharmacies to provide walk-in vaccinations to people without appointments, an official said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will also support pop-up and mobile clinics, which are aimed at individuals who may otherwise have trouble reaching vaccination sites. The White House is also preparing to "be able to mobilize immediately" if the Food and Drug Administration approves Pfizer's Covid vaccine for people ages 12-15 for emergency use, an official said. The administration officials also said more funding from the $1.9 trillion Covid relief law will be allocated toward rural health clinics and hospitals. The administration's new efforts appear to be aimed in part at tackling the issue of vaccine hesitancy. A Monmouth University poll published in mid-April, for instance, found that about 1 in 5 Americans say they won't get a shot. The new goal comes as the pace of daily shots slows , down to an average of 2.3 million reported vaccinations per day as of Monday from a high of 3.4 million on April 13. As of Monday, more than 145 million Americans age 18 and older, or 56.3% of the total adult population, have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roughly 104.7 million Americans age 18 and older, or 40.6% of the total adult population, are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Reaching the 70% figure does not mean the U.S. has achieved so-called herd immunity against the virus, the officials noted on the call. Some health experts have argued that between 70% and 85% of the U.S. population needs to be vaccinated against Covid to achieve herd immunity – the point at which enough people in a given community have antibodies against a specific disease. But one official said herd immunity is actually more "elusive" and the U.S. should just focus on vaccinating as many people as possible to drive down hospitalizations and deaths. "Covid-19 is going to vary in its degree and dynamics by community," according to the official. "So each community must individually strive to reach the goal of vaccinating 70% of his population by July 4." Biden, who made Covid his main focus when he took office Jan. 20, previously identified July 4 as a significant date in the United States' fight against the pandemic. In his first prime-time address to the nation in March, Biden set a goal for Americans to be able to gather in person with their friends and loved ones in small groups to celebrate the holiday. "If we all do our part, this country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, our kids will be back in school, and we'll have proven once again that this country can do anything," Biden said at that time.
Vice President Kamala Harris is taking on a leading role as an ambassador to small businesses, particularly in underrepresented communities. On Wednesday, she plans to meet with female-led small businesses in Rhode Island and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to discuss women leaving the labor force. Harris urged JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan to ramp up PPP loans and outreach to minority and low-income communities, an official said.	As the White House attempts to sell President Joe Biden 's multitrillion-dollar rescue and recovery plans across the country, Vice President Kamala Harris is taking on a leading role as an ambassador to small businesses, particularly in underrepresented communities. On Wednesday, she plans to meet with female-led small businesses in Rhode Island and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to discuss what Harris has called the "national emergency" of women leaving the labor force. Harris has held events with the Black Chamber of Commerce and spoken directly with community lenders who work with Native American tribes. Behind the scenes, Harris has pushed the country's biggest banks to get federal relief to the smallest players. Harris called JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon and Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan in February, urging them to ramp up Paycheck Protection Program loans and outreach to minority and low-income communities, according to a senior administration official who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the call. "An important part of the solution to moving that needle was going to be working with JPM and working with BofA to help make sure they were getting the support they needed to drive those priorities," the official told CNBC. "These are just going to be huge players in the PPP in terms of delivering on those goals just precisely because of the scale that they bring." A Bank of America spokesperson described the conversation as "productive." A representative from JPMorgan didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. While JPMorgan has played a role in making government-backed loans to small business during the pandemic, Dimon is skeptical of the scale of Biden's economic proposals. On Tuesday, Dimon cautioned against excessive federal spending. Speaking at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council , he warned that the administration won't fix the economy simply by throwing money at the problem and blamed government regulation for hampering growth. And while a majority of small businesses support the administration's infrastructure plan, according to the latest CNBC/SurveyMonkey poll, 59% don't believe the corporate tax rate should be raised to pay for it. The White House's "Getting Back on Track Tour" this week is intended to help blunt those concerns. Harris is using her public appearances this week to showcase small business as not only part of the administration's economic agenda, but also to reducing structural racial inequality that was laid bare during the pandemic. "Recognizing that reaching low- and moderate-income communities, reaching sole proprietors, which are disproportionately in communities of color — this was about the survival for a lot of these businesses," Michael Pyle, Harris' chief economic advisor, told CNBC. The public and private focus on small business is part of Harris' attempt to define her own portfolio as the White House hopes to leverage Democratic control of Washington to pass a dizzying array of sweeping reforms: roughly $4 trillion in spending on infrastructure, child care and education; overhauling the immigration system; voting rights; and addressing police misconduct. Already, Biden has asked Harris to oversee diplomatic outreach surrounding the surge in border crossings and the quest for universal broadband. Pyle said that Harris' focus on small businesses and lenders dates to before she took office: She helped secure $12 billion for community development financial institutions in the Covid relief package during negotiations with Republicans in December. "Part of what Americans aspire to is charting their own course and control over their own destiny and the opportunity to build wealth and success. Small business is right at the heart of what that vision is," Pyle said. "All too often, the process of starting a small business and getting the capital to start a small business hasn't been there for a lot of underserved communities in this country." One of Harris' longtime campaign advisors, Brian Brokaw, said the vice president's interest in the issue goes back even further. During her first elections in California, Harris would conduct "merchant walks" through immigrant neighborhoods in San Francisco, stopping in each shop to talk to the owners. As district attorney, and later state attorney general, Harris launched programs to help offenders reenter the workforce. "The best path out of a cycle of recidivism for a lot of these low-level offenders was to get them job training and skills so they can support themselves," Brokaw said. "She's always recognized the connection between smart criminal justice reform and economic policy."
Suspects in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol continue to face arrest as the Justice Department ramps up its probe. At least three supporters of former President Donald Trump were arrested as recently as Monday and charged with federal crimes related to the riot, according to court records. The arrests come as federal prosecutors wrestle with how to proceed in the sprawling investigation, which now includes more than 400 defendants.	Suspects in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol continue to face arrest as the Justice Department ramps up its probe into the most significant breach of the federal government in modern American history. At least three supporters of former President Donald Trump were arrested as recently as Monday and charged with federal crimes related to the riot, according to court records. Abram Markofski and Brandon Nelson of Wisconsin and John Douglas Wright of Ohio were all arrested Monday and charged with breaking into the Capitol, the records show. Filings from the Federal Bureau of Investigation show that Markofski and Nelson have been under investigation since shortly after a tipster contacted the FBI a day after the riot. A charging document in Wright's case references four unnamed cooperating witnesses who each confirmed that he was at the Capitol on Jan. 6 based on Wright's own posts on Facebook. The arrests come as federal prosecutors wrestle with how to proceed in the sprawling investigation, which now includes more than 400 defendants. In late April, prosecutors said they expect to charge at least 100 additional people, calling the probe "one of the largest in American history, both in terms of the number of defendants prosecuted and the nature and volume of the evidence." Officials have estimated that as many as 800 people may have participated in the effort to forcibly prevent Congress from confirming President Joe Biden 's victory in November's election, meaning that despite the large number of arrests, many of those who entered the Capitol on Jan. 6 will not face charges at all. The most serious charges have been filed against alleged members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, two right-wing groups. The Oath Keepers emphasize the recruitment of military and law enforcement members, while the Proud Boys have described themselves as "Western Chauvinists." Prosecutors have alleged that members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys worked together ahead of the riot to plan the attack. In court papers, they have cited messages from Kelly Meggs, an alleged member of the Oath Keepers, referring to an "alliance" between the two groups and apparently discussing plans for the riot. "We have decided to work together and shut this s--- down," Meggs allegedly wrote in a Dec. 19 post on Facebook cited by investigators. In another message a few days later, Meggs allegedly wrote to an unnamed person to "wait for the 6th when we are all in DC to insurrection." At least 25 alleged Proud Boys and a dozen alleged Oath Keepers have been charged to date. Defense attorneys for those who have been charged have denied that there was a plan to attack the Capitol. The bulk of those who have so far been arrested in the probe have been hit with lesser charges. More than 350 individuals are facing charges of entering or remaining in a restricted building, the Justice Department has said. More than 100 people have been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding an officer, according to a CBS News tally . One of the central legal battles to date has been over whether defendants will be forced to remain in jail while their charges remain pending. In March, the federal appeals court in Washington handed prosecutors a setback via a ruling that suggested that nonviolent rioters shouldn't be locked up before they are convicted. "In our view, those who actually assaulted police officers and broke through windows, doors, and barricades, and those who aided, conspired with, planned, or coordinated such actions, are in a different category of dangerousness than those who cheered on the violence or entered the Capitol after others cleared the way," Judge Robert Wilkins, an Obama appointee, wrote for a three-judge panel of the D.C. appeals court. The appeals court ruling cleared the way for many of the alleged rioters to await trial from home. It came in connection with a case against Eric Munchel and his mother, Lisa Marie Eisenhart, who were subsequently released from confinement. Munchel is allegedly the subject of viral photographs of a man wearing military gear and carrying zip-tie handcuffs inside the Capitol building. A federal judge in Washington on Tuesday ordered the release, on $1 million bond, of 23-year-old Connecticut resident Patrick McCaughey, who is charged with assaulting a police officer who had been stuck in a door frame by rioters. McCaughey had been jailed since mid-January. McCaughey's lawyer, Lindy Urso, said: "We are grateful that common sense and the law have prevailed over politics." Urso had argued that the judge, in denying bond earlier, had put the burden on the defense to show McCaughey was not a risk of flight or a danger to the public, as opposed to putting the burden on prosecutors to show that he was. Despite the March ruling from the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, lower court judges have agreed with prosecutors to allow some protesters to be locked up despite a lack of evidence of violence on Jan. 6. Last month, for instance, a federal district judge in Washington ordered two alleged Proud Boys leaders to be jailed pending trial. Judge Timothy Kelly acknowledged that Ethan Nordean of Seattle and Joseph Biggs of Florida lacked the "usual markers of dangerousness" but wrote that the two were charged with "seeking to steal one of the crown jewels of our country, in a sense, by interfering with the peaceful transfer of power." Kelly wrote that the men were alleged to have "facilitated political violence," even if prosecutors did not have evidence that they personally committed acts of violence. Experts have said prosecutors are likely looking to persuade participants to plead guilty and agree to cooperate with the investigation. So far, only one person, Jon Ryan Schaffer, has done so. Schaffer was a member of the Oath Keepers but is not one of the 12 individuals said to be affiliated with the group charged with conspiracy. Schaffer pleaded guilty last month to two charges carrying a possible maximum sentence of 30 years in prison: obstruction of an official proceeding and entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon. In a press release announcing Schaffer's guilty plea, released 100 days after Jan. 6, then-acting Deputy Attorney General John Carlin touted the progress the Justice Department had made in the investigation and said that Schaffer had admitted to being a "founding lifetime member of the Oath Keepers." "The FBI has made an average of more than four arrests a day, seven days a week since January 6th," Carlin said.
Biden's American Families Plan, which officials priced at $1.8 trillion, would actually cost American taxpayers $2.5 trillion, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. The university also said that the totality of current revenue-generating proposals to help pay for the bill would fall short at $1.3 trillion. The Wharton study found that the American Families Plan would increase government debt by almost 5% by 2050 and decrease GDP by 0.4%. The findings could complicate Biden's bid for legislation that would channel hundreds of billions of dollars to child care, education and health care.	President Joe Biden 's American Families Plan would cost far more than the White House estimates, and it would increase government debt while decreasing GDP, according to a study released Wednesday. The administration's latest stimulus plan, which officials priced at $1.8 trillion, would actually cost American taxpayers $2.5 trillion over the 10-year budget window, about $700 billion more than the White House's estimate, the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimated. The school explained that the sizable difference in headline cost projections is thanks to a disagreement over how much the plan's tax credits, as well as the universal pre-K and free community college provisions, would require. Meanwhile, the study said that Biden's proposed revenue-raising methods would fail to drum up the funds to cover the cost of the expansive stimulus. Wharton said that the totality of current revenue-generating proposals to help pay for the bill would fall short at $1.3 trillion. The study broke down how much each of Biden's revenue-raising proposals would add to baseline revenue over a 10-year period: The Wharton study found that the American Families Plan would increase government debt by almost 5% by 2050 and decrease GDP by 0.4%, as the effects from larger debt on the economy outweigh the productivity gains associated with the new spending programs. The White House declined to comment, but referred CNBC to a study published Monday by Moody's Analytics and economist Mark Zandi. Zandi, who advised progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., during her presidential campaign, wrote for Moody's that while the families plan near-term impacts are small, it provides "meaningful longer-term economic benefits" as more Americans return to work and attain higher levels of education. There are a number of differences between the Wharton study and Zandi's, including how far each looks into the future to estimate how the Biden plan would affect the U.S. economy. Zandi focuses his report to the next 10 years, whereas the Wharton report attempts to gauge how continued spending would influence economic growth in the long term. While Zandi touts the benefits of an economy unfettered by the bonds of child care and the potential to bring more women back into labor force, Wharton contends that spending on education, child care and paid leave increases government debt by 11.6% in 2050 and becomes a net drag on GDP. While Wharton found that better tax compliance measures would generate an additional $480 billion over 10 years, Zandi puts that number around $700 billion. The findings could complicate the president's bid to enact a sweeping piece of legislation that, if passed, would channel hundreds of billions of dollars to child care, education and health care. Among its many provisions, the Biden proposal seeks to fund universal preschool, a federal paid leave program, efforts to make child care more affordable and free community college for all. The White House said the $1.8 trillion would be split between $1 trillion in spending and $800 billion in tax credits. As another multitrillion-dollar piece of legislation, the administration says it plans to pay for the American Families Plan with new taxes on high-income households and by increasing IRS enforcement. The president would like to raise the top rate on income taxes to 39.6% from 37%. Further, Biden is proposing a hike in the long-term capital gains rate to 39.6%. Currently, the top rate on those gains is 20%. The increase would apply to households making more than $1 million. Even before the Wharton study, the package faced many more hurdles than Biden's American Jobs Plan, a $2.2 trillion physical infrastructure proposal . While Republicans have a litany of problems with Biden's infrastructure plan, they have expressed far less interest in additional spending for education, child care and paid leave than they have for building roads and bridges. The GOP has also protested against several of the tax proposals included in Biden's families and jobs plans, including an increase to the corporate, income and capital gains tax rates.
The Atlanta Civil Service Board announced Wednesday that it is reversing the termination of Garrett Rolfe, the former police officer charged in the fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks. "The Board concludes the appellant was not afforded his right to due process. Therefore, the Board grants the appeal of Garrett Rolfe and revokes his dismissal as an employee of the APD," the decision read.	The Atlanta Civil Service Board announced Wednesday that it is reversing the termination of Garrett Rolfe, the former police officer charged in the fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks. The board said in a five-page decision that the city failed "to comply with several provisions" of the Atlanta City Code and "the information received during witnesses' testimony." "The Board concludes the appellant was not afforded his right to due process. Therefore, the Board grants the appeal of Garrett Rolfe and revokes his dismissal as an employee of the APD," the decision read. Brooks, a Black man, was fatally shot in June in the parking lot of Wendy's. Rolfe and Officer Devin Brosnan were called to the restaurant after receiving a report about a man asleep behind the wheel of a car in the drive-thru. Dash and body camera video showed that Brooks appeared cooperative as police questioned him for more than 25 minutes. After he allegedly failed a field sobriety test, Books struggled with the officers as they tried to arrest him, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has said. During the struggle, Brooks grabbed one of the officer's stun guns and ran away with it. Officials said Brooks turned around and pointed the stun gun at police and was shot twice in the back. Then-Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said at a news conference shortly after the death that Brooks "never presented himself as a threat" and appeared "almost jovial." Howard said Brooks followed every instruction from the officers and was never informed that he was under arrest for driving under the influence. According to the DA, more than two minutes passed when medical aid was not provided to Brooks. During that time, Rolfe kicked Brooks' body and Brosnan stood on his shoulders. Rolfe was fired by the Atlanta Police Department on June 13, a day after the shooting. In August, he filed a lawsuit against Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and then-interim police Chief Rodney Bryant. In the suit, Rolfe said he was terminated "without an investigation, without proper notice, without a pre-disciplinary hearing, and in direct violation of the municipal code of the city of Atlanta." It also stated that his use of force "was proper and in compliance with Georgia law" and the police department's policies. Rolfe asked to be reinstated with back pay and benefits. Last month, he took part in a virtual hearing with the board to appeal his firing, according to WSB-TV of Atlanta. The Atlanta Police Department did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday about the board's decision. Rolfe and Brosnan were both charged for their roles in the deadly shooting. Rolfe was charged with 11 counts, including felony murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, criminal damage to proper and violation of oath. Brosnan was not fired by the department and was instead placed on administrative leave, even though he was charged with one count of aggravated assault and two counts of violation of oath.
The Biden administration announced Wednesday that it supports waiving intellectual property protections for Covid-19 vaccines. Such a waiver could remove obstacles to ramping up the production of vaccines in developing countries. The move comes as coronavirus infections surge to their highest levels in countries that have struggled to procure or distribute vaccines.	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced Wednesday that it supports waiving intellectual property protections for Covid-19 vaccines, as countries struggle to manufacture the life-saving doses. "This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures. The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines," United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai wrote in a statement. "As our vaccine supply for the American people is secured, the Administration will continue to ramp up its efforts — working with the private sector and all possible partners — to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution. It will also work to increase the raw materials needed to produce those vaccines," the statement added. The World Health Organization's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, praised the U.S. decision as a "monumental moment in the fight against Covid-19" that reflects the "moral leadership" of the White House in the fight to end the pandemic. Stocks of major pharmaceutical companies that have produced vaccines, including Moderna , BioNTech and Pfizer , dropped sharply after news of the potential  waivers first broke. Pfizer ended its trading day flat, while Moderna lost 6.1%; Johnson & Johnson shed a modest 0.4%. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America expressed pointed opposition to the Biden administration's support for waiving IP protections. The trade group's members include vaccine makers such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. "In the midst of a deadly pandemic, the Biden Administration has taken an unprecedented step that will undermine our global response to the pandemic and compromise safety," said Stephen J. Ubi, the group's president and CEO. "This decision will sow confusion between public and private partners, further weaken already strained supply chains and foster the proliferation of counterfeit vaccines. " World Trade Organization leaders reportedly urged member nations this week to quickly hash out the details of an agreement to temporarily ease the rules protecting intellectual property behind coronavirus vaccines. The waiver, proposed by South Africa and India, could remove obstacles to ramping up the production of vaccines in developing countries. An administration official with knowledge of Tai's decision cautioned that the WTO's discussions over waivers could take time and, since the body's rulings are based on consensus, will require approval from all 164 members. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, added that Tai held at least two dozen meetings and calls with various industry stakeholders, including the major vaccine manufacturers. The person added that Tai plans to advocate for friendly cooperation between global firms to ease supply-chain bottlenecks. President Joe Biden at the White House on Wednesday affirmed that the White House would back the World Trade Organization's IP waiver proposal. "Yes, I'm going to talk about that later today. Yes," Biden said shortly before Tai's statement was released. The Biden administration's move comes as coronavirus infections surge to their highest levels in countries that have struggled to procure or distribute vaccines, highlighting a contrast with other nations , including the U.S., Canada and the U.K. In recent weeks, India has grappled with a staggering rise in new coronavirus infections. Over the weekend, India reported 400,000 daily cases, bringing the nation's cumulative total to 20,665,148 cases, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University . The spike may have been triggered by a highly contagious Covid variant, known as B.1.617, which was first identified in India. "The Biden Administration understands that a pandemic doesn't respect boundaries and that what's happening in India has global public health implications," wrote Dewardic McNeal, an Obama-era policy analyst at the Defense Department . "If it spread to Africa or Latin America to the levels ravaging India that many countries on those continents would collapse," he added. "So this move is just good global public health policy." The variant has since been identified in other countries, including the United States. In April, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed lifting the patent protections of coronavirus vaccines with Biden, according to a readout of their call . The relaxation would grant governments quicker and more affordable access to the lifesaving doses. Last week, the Biden administration announced that it will immediately make raw materials needed for India's coronavirus vaccine production available . Critics have argued that patents on vaccines and other protections are not the central obstacle to producing more vaccines for the nations that need them most. Some also suggest such agreements could harm companies' incentives to innovate during future pandemics. "This is a huge misstep by the Biden Administration that will do nothing to increase vaccine distribution and will endorse China's ability to piggyback on U.S. innovation to further its vaccine diplomacy aims," Clete Willems, a former attorney at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, said of the decision. "A solution more in line with the Administration's stated objectives of improving U.S. competitiveness and keeping jobs in America would be to produce and export vaccines from the United States," said Willems, who worked under both the Obama and Trump administrations. A Washington Post editorial this week said the goal of creating a "people's vaccine" to defeat Covid is "more slogan than solution." McNeal acknowledged the concerns voiced by Willems, but noted that Tai's decision to make its vaccines broadly available may offer the Biden administration a backdoor way to improve American geopolitical standing abroad. "There is no question that vaccine diplomacy has become a major part of the geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China, and to some extent Russia and its Sputnik vaccine," McNeal wrote. "This move it will severely undercut the Chinese efforts to spread its vaccine (and influence) globally." "If the U.S. doesn't move on something like this with India in particular, it begs the question for many U.S. allies and partners 'what's in it for us?' to move closer to the U.S. versus China if we can't even get assistance in our time of need," he added. — CNBC's Kevin Breuninger and Tom Franck reported from New York.
Republicans escalated their threats to clamp down on tech giants after Facebook's oversight board upheld the company's decision to ban former President Donald Trump's social media accounts. Trump was suspended from numerous online platforms in the wake of the deadly invasion of the Capitol on Jan. 6 by a mob of his supporters. Trump now has most of his party's backing and is openly weighing a 2024 White House run.	Republicans on Wednesday escalated their threats to clamp down on tech giants after Facebook 's oversight board upheld the company's  decision to ban former President  Donald Trump 's Facebook and Instagram accounts. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., vowed to "rein in big tech power over our speech," while other GOP lawmakers and allies of Trump went further. "It is time that we break up big tech, not just regulate them," Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows said on Fox News after the board issued its ruling. Trump, who is out of office but remains a dominant presence in Republican politics, declared in a statement that "corrupt social media companies must pay a political price, and must never again be allowed to destroy and decimate our Electoral Process." The decision to uphold the former president's suspensions — at least for now — could impact the GOP's messaging as it aims to retake majority control of the House in 2022 on a platform of pro-Trump populism. Trump was suspended from numerous online platforms in the wake of the deadly invasion of the Capitol on Jan. 6 by a mob of his supporters. In its ruling Wednesday morning, the oversight board said that Trump "violated Facebook's rules prohibiting praise or support of people engaged in violence" with his posts on that day — including when he addressed the rioters in a video by saying, "We love you. You're very special." The board also criticized Facebook for making Trump's ban "indefinite" and gave the company six months to review the matter and "decide the appropriate penalty." After being impeached in the House for inciting an attempted insurrection and later acquitted in the Senate, Trump now has most of his party's backing and is openly weighing a 2024 White House run . He is also teasing the launch of his own rival media tools. Republicans and Democrats alike have previously called for greater oversight and regulation on Big Tech, an industry that has drawn perennial concerns about antitrust, privacy, national security and a number of other issues. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for instance, advocated breaking up Amazon , Google and Facebook during her 2020 presidential bid. But the decision to keep the muzzle on Trump, who has never conceded to President Joe Biden and who continues to falsely assert the 2020 race was stolen from him via widespread fraud, divided lawmakers along partisan lines. Republicans decried the move to "silence" the former president and accused Facebook and its oversight board of political bias. "Facebook is more interested in acting like a Democrat Super PAC than a platform for free speech and open debate," McCarthy wrote on Twitter , which has also banned Trump. "If they can ban President Trump, all conservative voices could be next. A House Republican majority will rein in big tech power over our speech," the GOP leader tweeted. "Facebook's status as a monopoly has led its leaders to believe it can silence and censor Americans' speech with no repercussions," said Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, in a statement. "Now more than ever we need aggressive antitrust reform to break up Facebook's monopoly," Buck said. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the judiciary panel's top-ranking Republican, was even more blunt. "Break them up," he tweeted. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., called the move "extremely disappointing," adding: "It's clear that Mark Zuckerberg views himself as the arbiter of free speech." Democrats, meanwhile, supported the board's ruling. "I applaud that decision. Facebook is not the public square," House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told The Washington Post. "Donald Trump is no voiceless victim," said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. "He richly earned his suspension from Facebook by spreading dangerous, violence-inciting lies." "Our nation is still living with the consequences of the deadly insurrection Donald Trump incited, and there is a clear and present danger that he will do it again," he said. "The decision by Facebook's self-funded panel upholds a minimal marker for truth and decency." "Facebook must now decide what it values more: profits or holding Donald Trump accountable for espousing hate, disinformation, and violence," Blumenthal said. Warren tweeted, "Trump should be banned for good" but stopped well short of giving kudos to Facebook. "Facebook is a disinformation-for-profit machine that won't accept responsibility for its role in the safety of our democracy and people," Warren's tweet said. The company "will continue to fumble with its power until Congress and antitrust regulators rein in Big Tech," she tweeted. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., pushed back on Republicans' free-speech arguments. "There's no Constitutional protection for using social media to incite an insurrection. Trump is willing to do anything for himself no matter the danger to our country," Schiff tweeted. "His big lies have cost America dearly. And until he stops, Facebook must ban him. Which is to say, forever." Trump, a prolific social media user, is also among its biggest critics, long accusing the companies of bias against him and calling for their legal protections to be stripped away. In his final weeks in office, Trump urged Congress to repeal Section 230, a decades-old law that shields tech companies from being held liable for what users post on their platforms. He even went so far as to tie the issue to the passage of a bipartisan defense spending bill and to the passage of a round of coronavirus stimulus checks . Conservatives and other critics of major social media sites have in recent years championed alternative platforms. People in Trump's orbit have recently teased the possibility of Trump soon unveiling his own offering. "In the next two to six weeks you will see a ramp up of additional platforms," Meadows said Wednesday on Fox. Trump is "fully engaged now about taking back the House and Senate in 2022," the former chief of staff said. Meadows added that "there will be rallies that happen very soon."
The biggest group of shareholders in Hometown International, the owner of a small New Jersey deli, is located in Macao. Hometown International's market capitalization has topped $100 million despite having a thinly traded over-the-counter stock, and an eatery with sales of less than $37,000 in the past two years. The Paulsboro deli is near a high school whose principal, Paul Morina, is also coach of the wrestling team, in addition to being Hometown's CEO.	You can buy an actual sandwich at that mystery New Jersey deli — but good luck finding some of the biggest investors in the $100 million company that owns only that one eatery. CNBC tried — hard — without success to locate a group of four investment entities purportedly based in Macao who comprise the largest shareholder group in deli owner Hometown International . One of those investors — cryptically named VCH Limited — also collects $25,000 per month from Hometown International for a consulting agreement related to efforts by the money-losing sandwich seller to merge with a private entity. E-Waste , a shell company with multiple ties to Hometown International, likewise is being positioned for such a transaction, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. While Hometown International operates a real Italian deli in Paulsboro, New Jersey — albeit a modest one with less than $37,000 in combined sales in the past two years — E-Waste has no actual business operations. Despite that fact, the market capitalization of both companies has topped $100 million in recent weeks, due to a seemingly inexplicable rise in the prices of their thinly traded stocks since last year, when overseas investors began taking stakes in the companies. The biggest single owner in both over-the-counter-traded companies is a Macao entity called Global Equity Limited, which holds 42 million common shares and warrants in Hometown International. Global Equity also is the largest shareholder, by far, in a third company called Med Spa Vacations, whose sole corporate officer, John Rollo, is the president of E-Waste. An SEC filing shows that Hometown International in February loaned Med Spa Vacations $150,000 at an interest rate of 6%. Med Spa Vacations says in filings that it is, like E-Waste, a shell company with no ongoing operations that likewise is seeking to combine with a private entity. Three other entities registered in Macao — VCH Limited, IPC-Trading Company and RTO Limited — each hold 10.5 million shares and warrants in the deli owner. Filings state that VCH Limited, IPC-Trading Company, RTO Limited and Global Equity Limited are based in the same downtown office building in Macao, a special administrative region of China and a major gambling mecca located less than 40 miles from Hong Kong. Except for VCH, whose listed address is on the fifth floor of that office building, the other entities are on the first floor, according to their filings in Macao's Commercial Registry Office. But a reporter found no actual offices of the entities at the building, or any other sign of them. Instead, the reporter found the offices of an accounting company and a related corporate services firm that seem to be acting as mail drops for the investors, and possibly providing other functions. Those other physical companies at the building are connected to one of Macao's biggest and most prestigious law firms. Likewise, nowhere to be found at the address were the individuals who are identified in SEC filings as their managers and controllers of their stock holdings. Those individuals also do not show up in a search of SEC filings for any other company besides Hometown International, E-Waste or Med Spa Vacations. The owners of Global Equity, whose registration filings say it began operations in 2016, are listed as two men, Michael Tyldesley and Ibrahima Thiam. Tyldesley also is listed as managing director of VCH, which was created in May 2017. IPC-Trading's owners are listed as Thiam and someone named Lan Moi Lilia. The listed owner of RTO Ltd. is a person named Nathalie Tina Pasaywon. Filings show that RTO was created on the same day in May 2016 as Global Equity. IPC-Trading began operations four months earlier. The opaque nature of the entities' ostensible address in Macao and of their managers adds even more questions to the already strange saga of Hometown International and E-Waste. Three weeks ago, Greenlight Capital hedge fund manager David Einhorn first raised eyebrows and sparked headlines about Hometown International, when he noted in a client letter that the company had an absurdly high market capitalization of more than $100 million despite owning only one tiny deli. Since then, reporters have scurried along I-95 to buy reportedly tasty cheesesteaks and Italian hoagies in Paulsboro, and Hometown International has seen had its stock demoted from a midtier over-the-counter trading platform because of irregularities in its public disclosures. OTC Markets Group at the same time slapped a "buyer beware" warning on Hometown International's stock. The deli company and E-Waste also terminated consulting agreements that had them paying a company controlled by the father of Hometown International Chairman Peter Coker Jr. a total of $17,500 per month after CNBC detailed those arrangements. Last Friday, Hometown International , in an extraordinary SEC filing, disavowed its market capitalization, saying that neither its revenues nor assets warranted such a high stock price. E-Waste issued an identical disavowal of its own stock price three days later. Hometown International's lawyer did not return a request for comment from CNBC for this article. Not all of Hometown International's owners are a mystery — or as much of a mystery — as the ones in Macao. The investor with perhaps the biggest public profile, Paul Morina, is CEO and president of Hometown International. He holds a whopping 30.5 million common shares and warrants in the company. Morina is renowned in New Jersey high school wrestling circles as coach of the Paulsboro High School team, which frequently wins state titles. He is also principal at Paulsboro High, whose other administrators include Christine Lindemuth, the only other executive officer of Hometown International. Lindenmuth owns no shares of the company, according to the latest SEC filings. Morina's brother Carmel Morina is the elected sheriff of Gloucester County, whose environs include Paulsboro, a small town located just across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. Paul Morina has not responded to repeated requests to comment by CNBC for the past three weeks. Hometown International has three major shareholders based in Hong Kong. One of those, Maso Capital Partners, last year created a Nasdaq-traded special purpose acquisition company whose board members include Hometown International Chairman Coker Jr., who is also based in Hong Kong. Coker's own corporate interests include a financially troubled hotel in Macao — The 13 — which initially had marketed itself as the most luxurious hotel property in the world. The hotel, whose initial investors included Steve Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors, Fidelity International and Omega Advisors , has been closed to guests since February 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Maso Capital's leaders include Manoj Jain, a former managing director at the asset manager previously known as Och-Ziff. Jain holds sole voting and investment power for the two other Hometown International investors in Hong Kong. Those investors are corporate arms of the investment funds of two American universities, Duke and Vanderbilt. Jain controls more than 52 million common shares and warrants for Hometown International through the Hong Kong entities. Last week, Jain became the first person affiliated with the deli owner to publicly comment in the weeks since it gained notoriety for its bizarre stock valuation. Jain told CNBC in a statement then that he was "very concerned" about "serious allegations" surrounding Coker's father, Peter Coker Sr., and others affiliated with the elder Coker's North Carolina company. His comment came after CNBC documented the messy legal and regulatory issues involving Coker Sr. — who is a key investor in Hometown International — and people connected to Coker Sr., in addition to Hometown International's accounting firm and the company's first lawyer . Coker Sr.'s firm Tryon Capital was being paid $15,000 per month by Hometown International and $2,500 per month by E-Waste for consulting work before those deals were terminated last month. An SEC filing shows that Tryon Capital in February began leasing office space to the third company, Med Spa Vacations, which also that month entered into a one-year consulting agreement that pays Tryon Capital $2,500 per month. A Coker Sr.-controlled company called Hometown Global Services is the second largest shareholder, after Global Equity Ltd., in Med Spa Vacations. In its annual report filed in March, Med Spa Vacations said it had no revenue for 2020, ended the year with no cash, and had a loss of more than $46,000 for that year. Unlike Jain, the Macao investors have kept mum in the midst of the controversies over Coker Sr. and Hometown International. On Wednesday, a reporter visited their legal address at 759 Avenida Da Praia Grande, a 15-story building called Lun Pong. The building, located in Macao's central business area, is surrounded by architecture dating to the period when Macao was a colony of Portugal, and is five minutes away from Senado Square, the city's focal point, and part of the UNESCO Historic Centre of Macao World Heritage Site. The building's lower five floors are owned by Rui Jose da Cunha, a founding partner at C&C Lawyers and Notaries — one of Macao's top legal firms — which has its offices there. None of the Hometown International investors or any of their managers or owners are listed by name on the directory in the building's lobby. But a company called Gestores de Projetos Limitada — or Project Managers Limited in Portuguese — is listed as a tenant of the first floor. That same floor — whose walls feature Chinese calligraphy and a painting of the Ruins of St. Paul's, a Catholic religious complex in Macao — is the legal address for all of the Hometown International investors in the city with the exception of VCH. Gestores de Projetos Limitada, also known as GEP, provides accounting services to small- and medium-sized business in Macao. "Whether you need to outsource your payroll tasks or to get an expert opinion on an investment opportunity in Macao, we're able to assist you in a timely and cost-effective manner," GEP's website says. "We also work closely with one of the biggest law firms in Macao to assure your company stays compliant with the laws of Macao and to assist you in a wide array of services, including company incorporation or appointment and removal of directors," the site says. When the reporter asked a GEP employee about Global Equity Limited, that person said GEP provides "services to this company," indicating that Global Equity has an address in GEP's office. The employee then called a partner in GEP, Rui Pedro Cunha, who told CNBC he was not familiar with the names of the entities known to be Hometown International investors. Cunha said GEP services companies that want an address in Macao. Those client companies get mail delivered to GEP, which then forwards it on to the companies, he said. "Usually, we do that in the cases of companies that are using our accounting services," said Cunha, whose father is the owner of the building's bottom five floors and the C&C law firm. Cunha said that he would check to see if the Hometown International investors were among GEP's clients. Cunha later emailed CNBC, saying, "I cannot confirm which company is (or isn't) a client of GEP, but if GEP is handling mail for a company and receives mail for them, GEP will be sure to forward it." CNBC then replied, asking him to forward requests to the Hometown International investors and associated people that they contact a reporter so that they could answer questions for this article, and comment for it. On the building's fifth floor — the purported location of the investor VCH — there is another company called C&C Secretariado Limitada, or C&C Corporate Services Limited. That company provides auditing and accounting services, in addition to domiciliation and administration services to companies that have no physical presence in Macao.

Rep. Liz Cheney wrote in an op-ed that the Republican Party must "steer away from the dangerous and anti-democratic Trump cult of personality." The GOP "is at a turning point, and Republicans must decide whether we are going to choose truth and fidelity to the Constitution," Cheney wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post. Cheney's clarion call came as a flood of House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise, say they are through with her serving as House Republican Conference chair.	The GOP must "steer away from the dangerous and anti-democratic Trump cult of personality," argued Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, in an op-ed Wednesday . "The Republican Party is at a turning point, and Republicans must decide whether we are going to choose truth and fidelity to the Constitution," Cheney wrote in The Washington Post. The clarion call from Cheney came as a flood of House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise, say they are through with her serving as House Republican Conference chair . But in the op-ed Cheney, of Wyoming, appeared to cast aside concerns about her status in the party. "History is watching. Our children are watching. We must be brave enough to defend the basic principles that underpin and protect our freedom and our democratic process. I am committed to doing that, no matter what the short-term political consequences might be," Cheney wrote. Cheney was the only member of Republican leadership to vote for former President Donald Trump's impeachment in the wake of the Jan. 6 invasion of the Capitol by a mob of his supporters. Trump "summoned this mob, assembled the mob and lit the flame of this attack," Cheney said at the time. Trump was acquitted in the Senate on an article of inciting an insurrection. Since Trump left office, Cheney has stood apart from many of her Republican colleagues through her willingness to keep speaking out against Trump, who continues to falsely insist he beat President Joe Biden and spread baseless conspiracy theories about widespread voter fraud. On Tuesday, McCarthy reportedly said of Cheney: "I've had it with her. You know, I've lost confidence." A spokeswoman for Scalise said the whip has pledged his support to Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who emerged as an ardent defender of Trump during his first impeachment . Trump and other Republicans have also backed Stefanik. Cheney's op-ed asserted that it's not enough to simply look the other way on Trump's unfounded election claims. "Trump is seeking to unravel critical elements of our constitutional structure that make democracy work — confidence in the result of elections and the rule of law. No other American president has ever done this," Cheney's op-ed said. "While embracing or ignoring Trump's statements might seem attractive to some for fundraising and political purposes, that approach will do profound long-term damage to our party and our country," she wrote. She pointed out that McCarthy, in the wake of the attack on the Capitol, said Trump "bears responsibility" for the attack and "should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding." McCarthy has now " changed his story ," said Cheney. Cheney rejected Trump's persistent claims about a "rigged" election that cast doubt on U.S. institutions. "This is immensely harmful, especially as we now compete on the world stage against Communist China and its claims that democracy is a failed system," she wrote. Republicans, Cheney said, should support the Department of Justice's ongoing investigations into the Jan. 6 invasion. More than 400 people now face charges related to the attack . The GOP should also back a "parallel bipartisan review" of the invasion "by a commission with subpoena power to seek and find facts," she said. Lastly, Republicans "need to stand for genuinely conservative principles, and steer away from the dangerous and anti-democratic Trump cult of personality," Cheney said. She invoked the memory of former President Ronald Reagan, a Republican icon, saying he "formed a broad coalition from across the political spectrum to return America to sanity, and we need to do the same now." "But this will not happen if Republicans choose to abandon the rule of law and join Trump's crusade to undermine the foundation of our democracy and reverse the legal outcome of the last election," she said.

Some donors say they will withhold contributions to anyone who opposes Cheney. That signals a split in the wealthy Republican donor ranks between big-money financiers who continue to back former President Trump and those more aligned with Cheney's views.	Liz Cheney's top financial supporters are standing by her despite a move by House Republicans to remove her as conference chair. Cheney, who represents the state of Wyoming, is unlikely to lose any of her major contributors even if she is ousted as an official leader within the House Republican caucus, according to donors who spoke to CNBC. Some even say they will withhold contributions to anyone who opposes Cheney. That signals a split in the wealthy Republican donor ranks between big-money financiers who continue to back former President Donald Trump and those more aligned with Cheney's views that Joe Biden won the 2020 election fair and square. Eric Levine, who is an owner of the law firm Eiseman Levine and a Republican fundraiser, told CNBC on Wednesday in an email that Cheney's business supporters plan to continue to back her. Those donors, he said, are concerned about Trump's influence over the Republican Party and how those forces will impact future elections. Levine gave over $2,800 to a Cheney joint fundraising committee in the first quarter, records show. "With but a few exceptions, that group appears to be uniformly supportive of Cheney and very concerned about Trumpism," Levine said. "Republicans can only win if we can make substantial inroads in the suburbs and with women.  Donald Trump is a proven loser in those precincts," he added. Republicans are hoping to win back majorities in the House and Senate during the 2022 midterm elections. Cheney is up for reelection next year and numerous Republicans have announced primary campaigns against her. Cheney's spokesman did not return a request for comment for this story. Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York has received support from House GOP leaders such as Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., to replace Cheney as conference chair. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif, said in a Fox News interview that he's heard from members that are "concerned about her [Cheney's] ability to carry out the job as conference chair, to carry out the message." Though Cheney voted more in line with Trump's positions than did Stefanik, according to data from FiveThirtyEight , the former also backed impeaching him after the deadly Jan. 6 riot on Capitol Hill. Cheney has consistently blamed Trump for inciting the riot that left at least five people dead. Stefanik, on the other hand, challenged the results of the 2020 presidential election that showed Joe Biden defeating Trump. Trump himself endorsed Stefanik for the leadership role and blasted Cheney on Wednesday for her stance on the election. CNBC reached out to many of Cheney's leading donors who contributed up to $2,800 to Team Cheney, a joint fundraising committee that brings in campaign cash for Cheney's political reelection campaign, her leadership political action committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee. Cheney's reelection campaign raised just over $1.5 million in the first quarter of this year, Federal Election Commission records show. Part of that success came on the backs of contributions from corporation PACs such as Pfizer, T-Mobile, Morgan Stanley and General Electric. Some companies said after the Capitol riot that they would pause donations to lawmakers that challenged the results of the election. Tony Fratto, founder of communications firm Hamilton Place Strategies and a former deputy press secretary under President George W. Bush, gave $2,800 to the committee in January. Fratto blasted the move by Republican leadership to remove Cheney and said he will not support anyone who oppose her. "It's absurd. Every word Liz Cheney has said about the outcome of the 2020 election, the events of January 6th, and the damage done to Republicans for lying about both is spot on," Fratto said Tuesday. "I'll support Liz for as long as she's in office, whether in leadership or not. And I'll never support any member who opposed her." The congresswoman's father, Dick Cheney, was Bush's vice president. A Wall Street executive who gave to the Cheney committee in the latter stages of the quarter, told CNBC that individual corporate donors are going to flee the Republican Party if GOP leaders move against the Wyoming lawmaker. This person declined to be named in order to avoid retribution for speaking out against Trump. "She's one of the last hopes that the Republican Party hasn't lost its mind. If she's ostracized, a lot of people will go with her," this financier said. "Corporate givers and lobbyists have to be strategic, but there's a really important principle at stake with what happens to her." Reginald Brown, a lawyer and a special assistant to Bush in the early 2000s, told CNBC that for many donors, Cheney represents a counterweight to some of the pro-Trump forces within the Republican Party. "She's a buy and hold investment for those who care about the Republican long game. A GOP that doesn't have room for women leaders or people that think the attack on the Capitol was nuts is going nowhere fast," Brown said in an email to CNBC. "Most business execs prefer Liz to the bare-chested guy with horns in the Capitol and the folks that egged him on." Brown gave $2,800 to Cheney in February. Devon Spurgeon, a partner at communications firm Sheridan Strategies, contributed $1,000 to Team Cheney in February. Spurgeon said that with these attacks from House Republican leaders, Cheney is on the path to acquiring new donors and igniting her base of supporters. "Liz is an independent thinker, she doesn't take direction from anyone. Clearly, this is a problem for certain members of House Leadership," Spurgeon told CNBC in a LinkedIn message. The addition of new donors has been an apparent theme of Cheney's since she voted to impeach Trump. Lawrence Mandelker, a lawyer at Eiseman Levine, who told CNBC he is a Democrat and has worked with members of both parties, admitted that one of the reasons he gave to Cheney's reelection effort was because of her vote to impeach Trump. "Even though I disagree with most of her substantive policy issues it was just important enough to say thank you in being a profile in courage," Mandelker said Wednesday in a phone interview. He gave $1,000 to Team Cheney in March, records show. Mandelker said he will continue to back her 2022 bid for reelection and will not donate to Stefanik's campaign. "I would never give her money because she drank the Kool-Aid," he said in describing Stefanik's appearance of ultimate loyalty to the former president.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer are still pushing President Joe Biden to forgive up to $50,000 per borrower in federal student debt through executive action. The White House is reviewing the president's legal authority to cancel loans, and he has urged Congress to forgive up to $10,000 in debt per borrower. Proponents say it will help the economy and reduce the wealth gap between white and Black Americans, while critics say it will disproportionately help high earners who racked up debt while getting advanced degrees.	Sen. Elizabeth Warren is not easing up on her campaign to get President Joe Biden to forgive student debt. The Massachusetts Democrat and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., have led members of the president's party in urging him to cancel up to $50,000 in federal student loans per borrower. Warren renewed the pressure on Biden on Thursday as his administration considers whether he has the authority to wipe out debt with the stroke of a pen. "This is something the president can do, and Leader Schumer and I are pushing hard to try to get it done," the senator said during a Washington Post event. Biden has questioned whether he can or should lift the student loan burden from millions of borrowers through executive action. He has called on lawmakers to pass bills that would forgive up to $10,000 in debt and make higher education more affordable. Some Democrats have pushed Biden to forgive loans as a means to boost the economy, ease a roughly $1.7 trillion strain on borrowers, and lift a disproportionate burden on Black and Latino Americans. Warren called canceling debt "the one thing Joe Biden could do by himself to help close the Black-white wealth gap." The action would apply to loans held by the federal government but not those by private lenders. Warren said the government would not have to increase taxes in order for Biden to cancel student debt through executive action. (Congress has the power to raise or cut taxes.) Last month, White House chief of staff Ron Klain said Biden would make a decision on whether to forgive loans after he reviewed an expected memo from Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. The document would outline the president's legal authority. A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request to comment on whether Biden has received the memo or when he expects to make a decision. Biden has signaled he does not want to forgive up to $50,000 in student debt. He echoed critics of broad cancelation in saying it would disproportionately benefit borrowers who racked up debt while earning advanced degrees — which are generally associated with higher earnings.

The battle over President Biden's economic recovery plan may undermine the Republican Party's attempt to rebrand itself as the party of the working class. Trump's presidency, the pandemic relief bills and recent GOP policy plans have all helped Republicans cement gains among working-class voters. But Biden's plan to raise taxes to fund blue-collar jobs and family benefits is pushing Republicans back into the position of defending corporate tax cuts and opposing popular policies.	WASHINGTON — The looming battle over tax hikes to fund President Joe Biden's economic recovery bills threatens to undermine the Republican Party's nascent, post-Trump effort to rebrand itself as the party of the working class. Over the past decade, the share of Americans with only a high school education who identified as Republicans has risen by more than 10 points, from 34% to 45%, according to NBC News/Wall Street Journal polling. Many of these voters were initially drawn to the GOP over cultural issues, not financial ones. But Trump injected economic populism into the party platform. In the 2020 election, despite losing the presidency, he won noncollege white men by 42 percentage points, and noncollege white women by 27 points. Over the past year, Republicans also joined Democrats in voting for massive Covid relief bills that strengthened the social safety net with cash payments and enhanced unemployment benefits — two things that Republicans rarely vote for. Since Biden took office in January, several GOP senators have released new policy plans that boost the incomes of working families, and that defy traditional, laissez-faire conservative economics. GOP Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah proposed raising the child tax credit in Biden's coronavirus relief bill even higher than Democrats had initially set it. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah has released a plan to provide a monthly cash benefit of $350 to families for each child under 6, and $250 a month for children 6-17 years old. And Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a staunch Trump supporter, announced legislation to give a tax credit to anyone making less than the mean hourly wage of $16.50, in the form of a quarterly check from the IRS. "Before Trump, the GOP plan was to be hands off on the economy," said Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center. "But Trump's victories, and the fact that he mobilized large-scale support and grew the blue-collar vote for Republicans, changed all that." In the House, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana , leader of the conservative Republican Study Committee, wrote a memo last month arguing that the only way for the Republican Party to win control of Congress was by "enthusiastically rebranding and reorienting as the Party of the Working Class." "For too long, the Republican Party fed into the narrative and the perception that the Republican Party was the party of big business or the party of Wall Street," wrote Banks. All these initiatives reflect a party "trying to catch up with the people who are supporting them," said John Russo, co-editor of the publication Working-Class Perspectives and a visiting scholar at the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor at Georgetown University. "Trump turned it upside down, especially when it comes to deficit spending. The GOP is trying to capture the voters he won over and keep them," he said. But Biden's economic recovery package now threatens to drive a wedge between Republicans and the working-class voters they're trying to hold onto, by forcing the GOP to choose between protecting corporate tax cuts or creating more blue-collar jobs. Russo noted that there are many ways to define "working class." For the purposes of this story, it means people without a college education. The Biden recovery plan is divided into two massive investment bills: the infrastructure-focused American Jobs Plan, and the American Families Plan, which expands education and child-care aid. The combined price tag for the plans is north of $4 trillion, but Biden intends to avoid ballooning the federal deficit in part by raising taxes on corporations and the very rich to pay for the programs. The chief beneficiaries of the plans will be Americans without a college degree and low-income workers. For Republicans, however, the bills' prospects begin and end at the tax hikes. Four years after passing the biggest tax cut in a generation in 2017, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said this week that any increase to the tax rates enshrined in the 2017 law would be a red line for Republicans. Calling the cuts among the most significant domestic accomplishments of Trump's presidency, the Kentucky Republican said, "We're not going to revisit the 2017 tax bill." He accused Democrats of wanting to "raise the corporate rate to the highest in the world," despite the fact that Biden proposes raising it only to 28%, which is still 7 points lower than the pre-2017 rate of 35%. Banks and the Republican Study Committee were equally outraged by the proposed tax increases on the wealthy and corporations. "Biden and Congressional Democrats' assault on American jobs and American taxpayers is simply unconscionable," the committee said in a statement on the proposed tax hikes. But the 2017 tax cuts didn't win over many Americans, a reality reflected in a wide array of polls both during and after the bill's passage in late 2017. But that's not surprising, given that multiple analyses of the bill's impacts have found that the biggest beneficiaries of the changes, by far, were the wealthiest Americans and corporations. Following the law's implementation, most voters did not report seeing any material change in their own circumstances. By contrast, the first part of Biden's package, the American Jobs Plan, appeals directly to noncollege educated voters: Three of every 4 infrastructure jobs created by the plan will require no more than a high school diploma. Biden has referred to the jobs plan as "a blue-collar blueprint to build America," and it is widely seen as more likely to become law in a Congress where Democrats hold only razor-thin majorities in both chambers. The second part of Biden's agenda, the American Families Plan, faces a narrower path to becoming law, and there are competing estimates of how much it would actually cost to greatly expand public education, child-care subsidies and unemployment benefits. Like the infrastructure bill, this, too, relies on making changes to the 2017 tax bill. But not all Republicans agree with McConnell's iron-clad refusal to revisit the 2017 tax cuts. According to Olsen, preserving tax cuts above all else reflects a kind of conservative economic thinking that's increasingly outdated. "With respect, Senator McConnell tends not to be comfortable being a policy entrepreneur, so defending the tax cut comes naturally for him," Olsen said. "But going forward, it ought not to be the Republican approach to economic policy." Instead, conservative economists like Olsen see the influx of noncollege educated voters to the GOP as a chance for the party to champion new kinds of economic policy that will appeal to working-class people because it genuinely benefits working-class people. Oren Cass, executive director of the conservative economic policy group American Compass, sees "a huge opportunity here for conservatives to tell voters what they'd like to do, and not just reject Biden's plan." Cass said the proposals introduced this spring by Republican senators like Romney and Hawley prove that there's fresh thinking inside the party about economic policies. "If you look at these proposals, there's real interest in providing benefits to working-class families," he said. "Hopefully, the fight this summer won't be over whether to get more benefits to working families, because both parties will support that. It'll be about how to do it," said Cass.
A landmark United Nations report has declared that drastically cutting emissions of methane, a key component of natural gas, is necessary to avoid the worst impacts of global climate change. The world could slash human-caused methane emissions by up to 45% this decade, according to the Global Methane Assessment. The report represents a shift in the worldwide conversation on how to best address the climate crisis, which has focused on setting longer-term carbon dioxide reduction targets.	A landmark United Nations report has declared that drastically cutting emissions of methane, a key component of natural gas, is necessary to avoid the worst impacts of global climate change . The report, published Thursday by the Climate and Clear Coalition and the U.N. Environment Programme, represents a shift in the worldwide conversation on how to best address the climate crisis, which has focused on longer-term carbon dioxide reduction. Methane is 84 times more potent than carbon and doesn't last as long in the atmosphere before it breaks down. This makes it a critical target for reducing global warming more quickly while simultaneously working to reduce other greenhouse gases. More than half of global methane emissions come from oil and gas extraction in the fossil fuel industry, landfills and wastewater from the waste sector, and livestock emissions from manure and enteric fermentation in the agricultural sector. The world could slash methane emissions by up to 45% this decade, or 180 million tons a year, according to the U.N.'s Global Methane Assessment. Such a target will avoid nearly 0.3 degrees Celsius of warming by 2045 and help limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a goal of the Paris climate accord. The report comes after methane emissions surged to record highs last year despite worldwide lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic, according to research from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Methane emissions are also rising faster than ever since record-keeping began in the 1980s. "Cutting methane is the strongest lever we have to slow climate change over the next 25 years and complements necessary efforts to reduce carbon dioxide," Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme, said in a statement. "The benefits to society, economies, and the environment are numerous and far outweigh the cost," Andersen said. "We need international cooperation to urgently reduce methane emissions as much as possible this decade." The fossil fuel industry has the greatest potential for reducing global emissions at little or negative cost by repairing leaks from oil and gas infrastructure, the report said. It added that companies that prevent leaks and capture methane could profit while curbing methane release. The report also pointed to the public health benefits of reducing methane, which is responsible for creating ground-level ozone, a dangerous air pollutant. The 45% methane emissions reduction would prevent 255,000 premature deaths, 775,000 asthma-related hospital visits and 73 billion hours of lost labor from extreme heat and 26 million tons of crop losses each year, according to the report. "We must tackle emissions not only from the energy sector, but also from landfills, agriculture, and abandoned coal mines," Jutta Paulus, a Green Party member of the European Parliament, said in a statement. "Setting aside dedicated funds for these super-emitters will be well-invested money on the path to reach our climate targets in 2030," Paulus said. A new study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters also said that cutting methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, agriculture and other human sources could slow global warming by as much as 30%. Oil and gas extraction, processing and distribution account for 23% of emissions, while coal mining comprises roughly 12% of emissions, the report said. Agriculture and livestock emissions from manure and enteric fermentation account for about 32% of methane emissions. CNBC has reached out to the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest trade group, and the American Farm Bureau Federation, a lobbying group for the U.S. agricultural sector, for comment on the U.N. report. Countries such as Russia, France and Argentina called for curbing methane emissions at the global leaders' climate summit hosted by President Joe Biden last month. In the U.S., the Senate recently restored an Obama-era regulation designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas fields by requiring companies to monitor and repair methane leaks from pipelines, storage facilities and wells.
Brian Kolfage, the previously indicted founder of an allegedly fraudulent donor campaign to build a border wall, was charged Tuesday by a grand jury on additional counts, of fraud and filing a false tax return. Kolfage was indicted last year along with three associates — including former Trump advisor Steve Bannon — on wire fraud and money-laundering conspiracy charges. Trump pardoned Bannon and dozens of others on his last night in office. Trump did not pardon Kolfage.	Brian Kolfage, who was previously indicted with Steve Bannon for his role in an allegedly fraudulent crowdfunding campaign to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, was indicted Tuesday on additional charges, of fraud and filing a false tax return. A federal grand jury in Florida accused Kolfage of failing to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in income on his 2019 taxes, according to the latest indictment. An arraignment and initial appearance for Kolfage are set for May 27 in a Pensacola courthouse before Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Timothy, court filings show. Kolfage, a disabled war veteran, was indicted last year in Manhattan federal court along with three associates , including Bannon, on wire fraud and money-laundering conspiracy charges. On his last night in office, former President Donald Trump pardoned Bannon and dozens of others . Trump did not pardon Kolfage. The charges all stemmed from "We Build the Wall," the ostensible fundraising campaign to privately build parts of the border wall promised by Trump. The Department of Justice alleged that Kolfage, who founded the campaign, and his associates defrauded "hundreds of thousands of donors" by raising millions of dollars "under the false pretense that all of that money would be spent on construction" of the border wall. Instead, the defendants schemed to slip some of that money to Kolfage, "which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle," the Justice Department said. In an email Friday, Kolfage attorney Harvey Steinberg said: "Unlike the government, we are not going to hold a press conference to celebrate the persecution of a war hero."
The Pentagon has deployed six B-52 Stratofortress bombers to the U.S. Central Command region, the combatant command that oversees America's military operations in the Middle East. In addition, the Pentagon has also extended the deployment of a U.S. Navy carrier strike group in the region. Last month, Biden announced a full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, ending America's longest war.	WASHINGTON – The Pentagon has ramped up its military assets in the Middle East as U.S. and NATO coalition forces begin the colossal task of withdrawing from Afghanistan. This week, two more U.S. Air Force B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers arrived at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, bringing the total number of B-52s on standby to respond to a Taliban attack to six. "We have made it exceedingly clear that protecting our forces and the forces of our allies and partners as they too withdraw is a priority, it's a main priority," Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday. "We have made plans to introduce additional ground force capabilities to, again, make sure that this is safe and orderly," Kirby added. The Pentagon also extended the deployment of a U.S. Navy carrier strike group in the region and deployed a dozen F-18 fighter jets to provide additional support. Kirby has previously said that U.S. Central Command, the combatant command that oversees American operations in the Middle East, will continue to assess the need for additional military capabilities as the departure of U.S. and coalition forces proceeds. "The President has decided to end America's involvement in our longest war and we're going to do just that. And so far, less than one week in, the drawdown is going according to plan," Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday. "Our focus is on making sure that we can retrograde our resources, our troops, our allies in a safe and orderly and responsible fashion," Austin said, adding that in the future the Defense Department, hopeful of congressional support, plans to provide financial aid to Afghan forces. Last week, the White House confirmed that U.S. troops had begun the withdrawal process from Afghanistan and that the Pentagon proactively deployed additional troops and military equipment to protect forces in the region. "Potential adversaries should know that if they attack us in our withdrawal, we will defend ourselves, [and] our partners, with all the tools at our disposal," White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling on Air Force One. "While these actions will initially result in increased forces levels, we remain committed to having all U.S. military personnel out of Afghanistan by Sept. 11, 2021," she said, adding that the Biden administration is intent on a "safe and responsible" exit from the war-torn country. In April, Biden announced a full withdrawal o f U.S. troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, ending America's longest war. The removal of approximately 3,000 U.S. service members coincides with the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which spurred America's entry into lengthy wars in the Middle East and Central Asia. Biden's withdrawal timeline breaks with a proposed deadline brokered last year by the Trump administration with the Taliban . According to that deal, all foreign forces would have had to leave Afghanistan by May 1. Since Biden's decision to exit the country, the U.S. has removed the equivalent of approximately 60 C-17 Globemaster loads of material out of Afghanistan, according to an update from Central Command. More than 1,300 pieces of equipment, which will not be left to the Afghan military, have also been handed over to the Defense Logistics Agency for destruction. The U.S. has also officially handed over one facility to the Afghan military. So far, Central Command estimates that the U.S. has completed between 2% and 6% of the withdrawal process.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the bill, SB 90, in a closed-door event that blocked out all reporters and media coverage — except for Fox News. The NAACP promptly filed a federal lawsuit alleging the law violates the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Florida is only the latest GOP-led state to push for new voting restrictions.	Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday signed into law a sweeping election bill that has drawn accusations it will suppress voter turnout and already faces a legal challenge. DeSantis signed the bill, SB 90, in a closed-door event that blocked out all reporters and media coverage — except for Fox News, which in a live interview applauded the Republican governor for his response to the coronavirus pandemic . DeSantis said in a press release that the new voting rules are designed to boost election security. "Floridians can rest assured that our state will remain a leader in ballot integrity," he said. However, civil and voting rights groups promptly filed a complaint in federal court alleging the law violates the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The NAACP, Disability Rights Florida and Common Cause argue that the law imposes burdensome identification requirements to vote by mail and severely limits drop boxes among other hurdles, provisions which will negatively impact voters of color and those with disabilities. "I'm not a fan of drop boxes at all, to be honest with you, but the legislature wanted to keep them," DeSantis said on Fox. The governor, who signed the bill inside a Hilton hotel near the Palm Beach airport, was flanked by supporters, who clapped and cheered at his answers in the interview. Meanwhile, local outlets reported being blocked out of the event. "News media is barred from entry at Gov. Ron DeSantis' signing of controversial elections bill," South Florida Sun Sentinel columnist Steve Bousquet tweeted. "DeSantis spokeswoman Taryn Fenske says bill signing is a 'Fox exclusive.'" CBS reporter Jay O'Brien said his outlet and others also were "not allowed into the event." DeSantis "signed a law today that will impact ALL Floridians. And only some viewers were allowed to see it. That's not normal," O'Brien tweeted. DeSantis' office did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment about why no journalists were allowed in the signing room. Florida is only the latest GOP-led state to push for new voting restrictions. Georgia passed a bill in March that prompted waves of criticism from Democrats, corporate leaders and sports leagues alike. Texas' legislature was reportedly set to vote Thursday on its own election bill. Former President Donald Trump , who remains a de facto GOP leader despite his loss to President Joe Biden , has repeatedly cast doubt about the integrity of the 2020 election before and after leaving office. Trump has spread an array of baseless conspiracy theories about widespread voter fraud and has falsely asserted he beat Biden. Top U.S. officials in the Trump administration said the election was secure and that no evidence of widespread fraud had been found that would reverse Biden's victory. House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney of Wyoming on Wednesday urged her colleagues to reject Trump's "cult of personality." "Trump is seeking to unravel critical elements of our constitutional structure that make democracy work — confidence in the result of elections and the rule of law. No other American president has ever done this," Cheney wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. A growing number of House Republicans, as well as Trump and his allies, now say they no longer support Cheney as a leader.
NYC's wealthiest executives would likely see tax rates higher than those on wealthy California residents in the budget recently signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Wealthy New Yorkers have previously signaled to CNBC they may leave New York altogether and head to Florida due to rising taxes. Former President Donald Trump's 2017 tax reform law capped SALT deductions at $10,000, hitting wealthy people in high-tax states like New York. Some Democrats, including Cuomo, are calling for President Joe Biden to lift the SALT cap as part of any tax changes under his administration.	New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is privately encouraging some of the state's wealthiest business leaders to remain in the Empire State and lobby lawmakers to remove the federal cap on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. Cuomo took the opportunity to discuss the topic with a small group of executives which included financiers from Wall Street during a call on Thursday, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. This person declined to be named in order to speak freely about a conversation deemed private. "As business leaders, we should be telling people to stay in New York and to try to get SALT in the new tax bill," the person with knowledge of the call said in describing the message from Cuomo to participants. The Biden administration wants to roll back parts of former President Donald Trump's 2017 tax reform law in order to fund infrastructure. Some Democrats, including Cuomo, are calling on the White House to remove the $10,000 cap Trump imposed on SALT deductions as part of any changes. A Cuomo press representative did not return repeated requests for comment. In the state budget recently signed by Cuomo, New York City's wealthiest executives would likely see combined local and state personal income tax rates higher than those on wealthy California residents. Within the more than $200 billion state budget, the top tax rate gets bumped to 9.65% from 8.82% for single filers who make more than $1 million. Those who make between $5 million and $25 million would be taxed at around 10.3%, and for those making more than $25 million the rate would be at 10.9%. Wealthy earners are expected to get hit with those new taxes in the next tax season, with the rates expiring in 2027. Wealthy New Yorkers have previously signaled to CNBC they may leave New York altogether and head to Florida with taxes on the verge of hitting historic levels for the rich in the Big Apple. Cuomo's engagement with these executives comes as he has been under siege for alleged sexual harassment and his administration's handling of nursing home death data during the Covid pandemic. Cuomo has denied the accusations of sexual harassment. Cuomo has also previously said he wants to run for a historic fourth term in 2022 and keeping big businesses, along with their leaders, from leaving New York could help him shore up support for another run. A recent Siena College Research Institute poll showed that 33% of respondents would vote to reelect Cuomo next year if he runs, compared to 57% who would prefer "someone else." Cuomo has previously called for removing the SALT cap. "Repealing SALT would lower the effective tax rate on the state's top earners by 37%," Cuomo said in April . "The state's new, top 10.9% tax rate becomes an effective 6.9% tax rate," he explained. Cuomo was part of a group of governors that sent a letter to President Joe Biden calling for the repeal of the SALT cap. Taxpayers, particularly wealthy people in New York and other high-tax states including New Jersey and California, saw the biggest benefits when there was no cap on SALT deductions, which include property and income taxes at the state and local levels. Executives in New York, including leaders of the Partnership for New York City, have pushed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Biden's team to bring back the full deduction. Reps. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y. and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., are among some of the Democratic lawmakers who say they will oppose any changes to the tax code unless SALT is brought back. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in April that the SALT deduction "would not be a revenue raiser" and it's unclear if the Biden administration plans to include repealing the cap as part of their infrastructure plan. Biden is looking to raise taxes to pay for his $2 trillion infrastructure proposal. Biden has said he is open to raising the corporate tax rate to between 25% and 28% as a way to pay for his infrastructure plan, and has vowed not to raise taxes on those making less than $400,000.
A federal grand jury has indicted four former Minneapolis police officers for violating the civil rights of George Floyd, who died during his arrest last May. The videotaped death sparked nationwide protests and demands for the reform of police departments. The indictment comes weeks after one of those ex-cops, Derek Chauvin, was convicted at a state trial of murder and manslaughter in the death of Floyd. Chauvin separately was charged in another federal indictment with violating the civil rights of a 14-year Minneapolis boy during a September 2017 arrest by holding the boy by the neck and hitting him multiple times in the head with a flashlight "without legal justification."	A federal grand jury has indicted Derek Chauvin and three other former Minneapolis police officers for violating the civil rights of George Floyd, the Black man whose videotaped death last May during an arrest sparked nationwide protests and demands for the reform of police departments. Chauvin separately was charged in another federal indictment with violating the civil rights of a 14-year-old Minneapolis boy during a September 2017 arrest by holding the boy by the neck and hitting him multiple times in the head with a flashlight "without legal justification." The new criminal charges revealed Friday come nearly three weeks after Chauvin was convicted at a state trial of murder and manslaughter in the death of Floyd , and three months before the other ex-officers are due to face another state trial for his death. The federal indictment accuses Chauvin — who held his knee on or around the neck of a handcuffed and prone Floyd for more than nine minutes — of killing the 46-year-old while violating his rights to be protected from use of unreasonable force by a police officer. It also accuses two of Chauvin's fellow cops — Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng — of "willfully" failing to intervene to stop Chauvin from using unreasonable force, a failure that also led to Floyd's death. All three ex-officers, along with the fourth, Thomas Lane, are accused of letting Floyd die by willfully failing to aid him when they saw Floyd "lying on the ground in clear need of medical care." Floyd was being detained by the cops on suspicion of having used a counterfeit bill in a purchase. In the separate federal indictment related to his arrest of the 14-year-old, Chauvin likewise is accused of holding his knee on the neck and upper back of the boy, even after the teen "was lying prone, handcuffed, and unresisting." "This offense resulted in bodily injury to" the boy, that indictment says. Chauvin, whose actions against the boy were caught on camera, was responding to a call by a woman who said that her son and daughter had assaulted her, the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper has reported. The Star Tribune also reported that Chauvin struck the boy in the head repeatedly with his flashlight after the boy refused to get up off the floor, and then choked the boy unconscious with his knee. The federal criminal indictments are separate from a U.S. Justice Department investigation into the practices of the Minneapolis Police Department that was announced by Attorney General Merrick Garland a day after Chauvin was convicted. Garland said that probe will assess whether the MPD "engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force, including during protests." The Star Tribune last week reported that on the heels of the state jury verdicts against Chauvin that federal prosecutors were preparing to ask a grand jury in U.S. District Court in Minnesota to indict Chauvin and the other three cops involved in arresting Floyd. The newspaper also had reported federal authorities wanted to have Chauvin indicted for the case involving the 14-year-old. Chauvin, an 18-year police veteran, is due to be sentenced in the state case in June. Earlier this week his lawyers filed an appeal, arguing that publicity about the case over the past year harmed Chauvin's right to fair trial. The appeal also says the trial judge erred in not granting a defense motion that sought to have Chauvin tried outside of Minneapolis. All four of the ex-cops are charged in the new federal indictment with deprivation of rights under color of law, alleging they "willfully deprived George Floyd of the right, secured and protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States, to be free from unreasonable seizure, which includes the right to be free from use of unreasonable force by a police officer." One of the counts, which is aimed solely at Chauvin, says that the cop held his left knee across Floyd's neck, and his right knee on Floyd's back and arm, and kept his knees on "Floyd's neck and body even after Floyd became unresponsive." "This offense resulted in bodily injury to, and the death of, George Floyd," the indictment says. Count two of the indictment says that Thao and Keung, "were aware" that Chauvin was using his knee to hold Floyd down by the neck, and that he continued to do so "even after Floyd became unresponsive." "The defendants willfully failed to intervene to stop Defendant Chauvin's use of unreasonable force," the indictment says. "This offense resulted in bodily injury to, and the death of, George Floyd." All four cops are jointly charged with violating Floyd's civil rights by acting with "deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs." "Specifically, the defendants saw George Floyd lying on the ground in clear need of medical care, and willfully failed to aid Floyd, thereby acting with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of harm to Floyd," the indictment says. "This offense resulted in bodily injury to, and the death of, George Floyd."
Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said after a disappointing April jobs report that in normal circumstances 266,000 new jobs "is a good number." Walsh rejected arguments made by Republican lawmakers and business groups that pandemic-related federal unemployment benefits are encouraging potential workers to stay on the sidelines. Among the barriers that remain for potential workers, Walsh said, are lack of child care options and schools that remain closed.	Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said Friday the Covid-19 pandemic is still weighing on jobs, but he projected optimism about recovery of the U.S. economy as vaccinations continue, saying, "We are starting to see the confidence come back." Walsh's comments on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" came shortly after the Labor Department released a disappointing April jobs report , showing that nonfarm payrolls grew by 266,000. Analysts had been expecting more than 1 million new jobs. "Under normal circumstances — and certainly we are not living in normal circumstances — a 266,000 job gain a month is a good number," Walsh said. "Unfortunately, we are still in the midst of a pandemic." "If you look back on the last three months, the United States economy has added 500,000 new jobs per month as compared to the previous three months, where it was 60,000. So we are definitely going in the right direction, but we still have a ways to go, there's no question about it. We are still dealing with a pandemic," Walsh said. Walsh rejected arguments made by Republican lawmakers and business groups that pandemic-related federal unemployment benefits are encouraging potential workers to stay on the sidelines. "I still think we need unemployment, obviously, we still have millions of Americans out of work. Many of those Americans don't have opportunities at this moment," Walsh said. "I know we are making a correlation between open jobs and people who are unemployed, but it's not a fair correlation." Walsh pointed to data from the jobs report showing that more Americans looked for work in April than in previous months. "I think as we continue to move forward here, hopefully in the coming months we are going to see lots of those Americans who are looking for jobs finding jobs, and I'll be able to stand in front of this camera and talk about the great gains we've had," Walsh said. "But I still think 266,000 jobs this month is a good number." Shortly after the jobs report was released, the Chamber of Commerce put out a statement calling for an end to the $300-per-week unemployment supplement. Neil Bradley, an executive vice president at the group, said the "disappointing jobs report makes it clear that paying people not to work is dampening what should be a stronger jobs market." President Joe Biden said at a press conference in the afternoon that the extra benefits were not causing a labor supply shortage. Walsh, a Democrat and the former mayor of Boston, said that cutting the unemployment boost was a nonstarter. "There are millions of Americans that have been impacted by the coronavirus that lost their job; some of their work is not coming back," he said. "We have lost restaurants. We have lost businesses. I wouldn't say we are in the midst of pandemic ... but we are still living and dealing with the pandemic, and as we continue to move forward here we will continue to recover." Among the barriers that remain for potential workers, Walsh said, are lack of child care options and schools that remain closed. "Those are two barriers right now in my opinion that are keeping people out of the work force as well, because their children are at home, learning remotely, or their child care facility is not open," Walsh said. "There have been investments made by the president in those areas, but we need to continue to make those investments so that people feel — know — they can go back to work." Walsh said there are other reasons why Americans haven't returned to work at the level that analysts expected — that it could not be reduced to a single explanation. "It's not a simple answer," he said.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Friday blamed a $300-per-week federal jobless benefit for enticing Americans to stay at home and April's far-weaker-than-expected jobs report. A Chamber spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that it will be using similar messaging to start lobbying the White House and Capitol Hill to end the payout.	The largest business lobbying group in America on Friday blamed a $300-per-week federal jobless benefit for enticing Americans to stay at home and April's far-weaker-than-expected jobs report. "The disappointing jobs report makes it clear that paying people not to work is dampening what should be a stronger jobs market," the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in the hours after the Labor Department released its April 2021 employment report. "One step policymakers should take now is ending the $300 weekly supplemental unemployment benefit," the lobbying group added. "Based on the Chamber's analysis, the $300 benefit results in approximately one in four recipients taking home more in unemployment than they earned working." A Chamber spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that it will be using similar messaging to lobby the White House and Capitol Hill to end the payout. The group's attack against the federal unemployment benefit came hours after the Labor Department reported that total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 266,000 last month , far below the 1 million expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. The Biden administration has pushed back on arguments like the Chamber's. Appearing on CNBC on Friday, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh rejected arguments made by Republicans and business groups that the enhanced unemployment benefits are encouraging potential workers to stay home. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also panned such critiques and told reporters Friday afternoon that she doesn't think the addition to unemployment benefits "is really the factor that is making a difference." "When you look across states, or across sectors, or across workers, if it were really the extra benefits that were holding back hiring, you'd expect to see that either in states, or for workers in or sectors where the replacement rate due to [unemployment insurance] is very high — you'd expect to see lower job-finding rates," she said. "And, in fact, what you see is the exact opposite." Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, offered a cynical view of the Chamber's criticism of the $300-a-week benefit. For much of the past year, millions of unemployed Americans have qualified for a special federal jobless benefit to help replace income lost as a result of layoffs during the Covid-19 pandemic . The first such federal jobless benefit began under former President Donald Trump in March 2020, when he signed the CARES Act. That law provided unemployed Americans with a $600 weekly supplement, which in many cases was greater income than workers received while employed full time. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., countered that corporations should instead be paying their workers higher wages. President Joe Biden 's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, signed into law in March, provides unemployment payments of $300 per week. Without any additional government intervention, that benefit will expire in early September. Some economists and many Republicans have blamed the benefit for discouraging Americans from returning to the jobs they held before the pandemic. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, for example, earlier this week ordered the state's Department of Employment and Workforce to withdraw from the federal government's pandemic programs by the end of June. "This labor shortage is being created in large part by the supplemental unemployment payments that the federal government provides claimants on top of their state unemployment benefits," McMaster said in a press release dated Thursday. "What was intended to be a short-term financial assistance for the vulnerable and displaced during the height of the pandemic has turned into a dangerous federal entitlement, incentivizing and paying workers to stay at home rather than encouraging them to return to the workplace," he added.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the CDC health expert who sounded alarms about the threat posed to the U.S. by the coronavirus, is resigning. Even before the virus descended on the U.S., Messonnier urged the nation to start preparing for a massive outbreak that would drastically affect normal life. Messonnier's stark warnings contrasted sharply with then-President Donald Trump's messaging at the same time.	Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the health expert who was among the first to sound alarms about the threat posed to the U.S. by the coronavirus, is resigning from her role at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency's director confirmed Friday. Messonnier "leaves behind a strong force of leadership and courage in all that she's done," CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing. "I want to wish her the best in her future endeavors." Walensky did not address a reporter's question asking why Messonnier was recently reassigned from her role leading the CDC's Covid vaccine task force. Messonnier, who had served as director of the agency's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases since 2016, will resign from the agency effective May 14, multiple outlets reported Friday . She will take on a new role as executive director for pandemic and public health systems at the Skoll Foundation, a California-based organization, she reportedly told colleagues in an email. Walensky received Messonnier's resignation Friday morning, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald told CNBC. The resignation was first reported by The Washington Post. In early 2020, when fewer than 100 Covid cases had been reported in the U.S., Messonnier urged the nation to start preparing for a massive outbreak that would drastically affect normal life . "I understand this whole situation may seem overwhelming and that disruption to everyday life may be severe. But these are things that people need to start thinking about now," Messonnier said in February 2020. Messonnier's stark warnings contrasted sharply with then-President Donald Trump 's messaging at the same time , prompting him to threaten to fire her, outlets have reported . The former president had incorrectly tried to assure the nation that the small number of U.S. Covid cases "within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero" and will disappear "like a miracle." More than 32,606,724 Covid infections have been reported in the U.S., and at least 580,076 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
President Joe Biden said April's lower than expected job growth shows that his massive infrastructure and family support bills are needed now more than ever. The president rejected the idea that federal unemployment benefits are removing incentives for people to return to the labor force.	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Friday that April's lower than expected job growth reveals that the U.S. economy is still struggling to recover from the Covid pandemic, and that his massive infrastructure and family support bills are needed now more than ever. "This month's job numbers show we are on the right track," said Biden. "But we still have a long way to go. My laser focus is on growing the nation's economy and creating jobs. My laser focus is on vaccinating, and my laser focus is on one more thing: making sure that hard working people in this country are no longer left out in the cold." Hours before Biden spoke, the Labor Department reported that hiring slowed dramatically in April , with nonfarm payrolls increasing by a much less than expected 266,000 and the unemployment rate rose to 6.1% amid an escalating shortage of available workers. Dow Jones estimates had been for 1 million new jobs and an unemployment rate of 5.8%. Many economists had been expecting an even higher jobs number amid signs that the U.S. economy was roaring back to life. Biden said the slow pace of recovery served to rebut critics of the administration's Covid relief efforts. "Some critics said we didn't need the American Rescue Plan, that this economy would just heal itself. Today's report just underscores, in my view, how vital the actions we are taking are," the president said. "Our efforts are starting to work, but the climb is steep, and we have a long way to go." The lower-than-expected job growth could strengthen the Biden administration's argument to Congress that the president's $4 trillion jobs and families plans are needed to help the U.S. economy fully recover from the pandemic. Biden's infrastructure bill, dubbed the American Jobs Plan, would spend $2.3 trillion on rebuilding the nation's transportation infrastructure and create millions of jobs for workers without a college degree. The second piece of his domestic agenda, the American Families Plan, would dedicate another $1.8 trillion to fund universal prekindergarten, offering free community college to every American and subsidizing child care, among other proposals. Biden intends to fund his economic recovery packages by increasing the corporate tax rate, raising taxes on the very rich, closing loopholes and increasing IRS enforcement. And while the president hopes to win some bipartisan support for the bills, Republicans in Congress have already said that raising taxes is a red line they won't cross. Negotiations are ongoing, however, and a group of Republican senators is expected to visit the White House in coming days to meet with the president about potential areas of compromise. The weak jobs recovery also reflects what many economists say is a labor shortage across multiple sectors. "I think this is just as much about a shortage in labor supply as it is about a shortage of labor demand," Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University and a former Obama administration advisor, told CNBC. "If you look at April, it appears that there were about 1.1 unemployed workers for every job opening. So there are a lot of jobs out there, there is just still not a lot of labor supply." Republicans and some employers have blamed the labor shortage on what they say are overly generous unemployment benefits that were approved by Congress as part of the broad pandemic relief package. Specifically, they point to a $300 per week federal unemployment bonus above and beyond what states provide, which is set to expire in September. "I told you weeks ago that in Florida I hear from small business everyday that they can't hire people because the government is paying them to not go back to work," Republican Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted on Friday. Biden rejected that argument. "Today's report is a rebuttal to loose talk that Americans just don't want to work," he said. "What this report shows is that there's a much bigger problem: It is that our economy still has 8 million fewer jobs than when this pandemic started." The president also said the impact of unemployment benefits on labor markets was "nothing measurable." Census data taken in recent weeks suggests the closures of day-care centers and schools have forced millions of Americans to stay home and care for children or oversee online learning. According to a Census Household Pulse surveys taken in late March , 6.3 million people reported that they were not working because they needed to care for a child not in a school or day care. Another 2.1 million were caring for an older person. An additional 4.1 million Americans said they were not working because of concerns about getting or spreading Covid. --- CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.
Threats against federal lawmakers have more than doubled so far this year compared with last year, the United States Capitol Police said Friday. The law enforcement agency tasked with defending Congress reported a 107% increase in threats against members of Congress compared with the same point in 2020. "Provided the unique threat environment we currently live in, the Department is confident the number of cases will continue to increase," the agency said in a press release posted online.	Threats against federal lawmakers have more than doubled so far this year compared with last year, the United States Capitol Police said Friday. The law enforcement agency tasked with defending Congress reported a 107% increase in threats against members of the legislative body compared with the same point in 2020. "Provided the unique threat environment we currently live in, the Department is confident the number of cases will continue to increase," the agency said in a press release posted online. The report comes months after a mob of supporters of former President Donald Trump overwhelmed the police department and stormed the Capitol in an effort to prevent Congress from confirming President Joe Biden 's victory. The Justice Department has estimated that about 800 individuals may have been involved in the Jan. 6 attack. More than 400 alleged rioters are now facing criminal charges, and arrests are continuing . Steven Sund, who led the police department at the time of the riot, resigned on Jan. 7. Friday's release is consistent with comments from lawmakers, who have said that their security is more at risk as a result of the political atmosphere. In January, members of the House of Representatives sent House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other congressional leaders a letter asking for broader authorization to use a congressional fund for security measures, citing increased risks. Several lawmakers who were supportive of impeaching Trump have also boosted their own spending on security since the Jan. 6 attack, financial disclosures show . The police department has previously said that threats were on the rise. In March, acting USCP Chief Yogananda Pittman told Congress that threats against lawmakers were up more than 90% in the first two months of the year. Between 2017 and 2020, she said, there was a 118.66% increase in threats and "directions of interest. " The Jan. 6 attack prompted the Capitol Police to ask Congress for more funding. The police department has asked for a $107 million increase in its 2022 budget compared with its fiscal year 2021 budget. That ask reflects revisions to the budget request made after the riot. The original request, prior to Jan. 6, called for a $36 million increase in funding over 2021 levels. In its press release, the police department continued its push for more funding. It said that it agreed with recommendations issued in an April report from the agency's inspector general to increase its staff dedicated to threat assessment and to establish a stand-alone countersurveillance entity. Both proposals, the police department said, would "require resources and authorization." "In its report, the [inspector general] suggests the Department's Threat Assessment Section be similar to the United States Secret Service (USSS). In 2020, the USSS, which has more than 100 agents and analysts, had approximately 8,000 cases. During the same time period, the USCP, which has just over 30 agents and analysts, had approximately 9,000 cases," the department said. The police department added, "The USCP agrees a stand-alone counter-surveillance unit would be valuable. However, in order to fully implement this recommendation, the Department would require additional resources for new employees, training, and vehicles as well as approval from Congressional stakeholders."
Colonial Pipeline fell victim to a cybersecurity attack on Friday that involved ransomware, forcing it to temporarily shut down all pipeline operations. Colonial transports nearly half of the East Coast's fuel supply through a system that spans over 5,500 miles between Texas and New Jersey. The pipeline transports gasoline, diesel, home heating oil and jet fuel. It also supplies the military. John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York, said the U.S. will see spot shortages of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel develop rapidly if the outage persists. President Joe Biden was briefed on the incident Saturday morning, according to the White House.	The operator of the country's largest fuel pipeline, Colonial Pipeline, fell victim to a cybersecurity attack on Friday that involved ransomware, forcing it to temporarily shut down all pipeline operations and raising concern that the outage could lead to spot shortages of gas, diesel and jet fuel. The company confirmed it was the victim of a ransomware attack Saturday. Colonial Pipeline has hired a third-party cybersecurity firm to launch a probe into the incident and has contacted law enforcement and other federal agencies. The cyberattack has affected some of its IT systems too. The F.B.I. was notified of the disruption on Friday and is working closely with the company and government partners, a spokesperson said Saturday. Colonial Pipeline, which transports nearly half of the East Coast's fuel supply, said it is "taking steps to understand and resolve this issue." "At this time, our primary focus is the safe and efficient restoration of our service and our efforts to return to normal operation," the company said in a statement. "This process is already underway, and we are working diligently to address this matter and to minimize disruption to our customers and those who rely on Colonial Pipeline," the company said. President Joe Biden was briefed on the incident Saturday morning and the federal government is working to avoid supply disruptions, according to a White House spokesperson. "The federal government is working actively to assess the implications of this incident, avoid disruption to supply, and help the company restore pipeline operations as quickly as possible," the spokesperson said. Colonial operates the largest refined products pipeline in the U.S., transporting 100 million gallons or 2.5 million barrels per day, according to its website. Refined products include gas, diesel, home heating oil and jet fuel. The pipeline also supplies the U.S. military. Colonial's system spans over 5,500 miles between Texas and New Jersey, connecting refineries on the Gulf Coast to more than 50 million people in the southern and eastern U.S., according to the company. Colonial Pipeline is privately held by five entities: CDPQ Colonial Partners, IFM (U.S.) Colonial Pipeline 2, KKR-Keats Pipeline Investors, Koch Capital Investments Company, and Shell Midstream Operating. John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York, said the U.S. will see spot shortages of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel develop rapidly if the outage persists. "It appears that it was a ransomware attack, rather than a state actor, but it highlights the significant software vulnerability across the industry," Kilduff said. "If there's is not a resumption of operations by tomorrow night or at least some clarity on a resumption, gasoline prices will skyrocket on the open of trading Sunday night." Andy Lipow, president of Texas-based Lipow Oil Associates, said an outage that last one to two days would cause some minor inconveniences and that more widespread impact would occur after four to five days of shutdown. There could be potential sporadic outages as well if a specific terminal was relying on a delivery today or tomorrow and that is now delayed, Lipow said. "Unlike the February freeze or hurricane, refineries are still in operation turning crude into gasoline, jet and diesel. They just can't get it to the terminals," Lipow said. "An extended colonial pipeline outage will force refiners to reduce their operating rates as inventory in the refinery fills up." "While they may not be able to ship it to Colonial, the refineries will certainly be able to continue shipping to the Midwest markets," Lipow said. The Biden administration in April announced a 100-day plan to protect the country's electric system supply chain from cyberattacks amid growing concerns over how vulnerable the U.S. power supply is to cyber threats. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees interstate pipelines, said it is aware of the cyberattack and is monitoring the situation. "We are aware of what appears to have been a serious cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline system," Chairman Richard Glick said in a statement to CNBC. "FERC is in communication with other federal agencies, and we are working closely with them to monitor developments." The U.S. Department of Energy is coordinating with Colonial Pipeline, the energy sector, states and interagency partners to support response efforts, according to an agency spokesperson. "DOE is also working closely with the energy sector coordinating councils and the energy information sharing and analysis centers, and is monitoring any potential impacts to energy supply," the spokesperson told CNBC. Eric Goldstein, executive assistant director of the cybersecurity division at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said the agency is working with Colonial Pipeline and interagency partners. "This underscores the threat that ransomware poses to organizations regardless of size or sector," Goldstein said.
Colonial Pipeline is working to restore service and has some smaller lateral lines between terminals and delivery points operating again, the company announced Sunday afternoon. Its four mainlines remain offline. The company, the operator of the country's largest fuel pipeline, temporarily suspended all operations due to a ransomware attack on Friday. "We are in the process of restoring service to other laterals and will bring our full system back online only when we believe it is safe to do so, and in full compliance with the approval of all federal regulations," the company said in a statement.

The federal government is working to avoid supply disruptions after the company suspended operations, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Sunday morning. "This is what businesses now have to worry about," Raimondo said during an interview on CBS' "Face the Nation." "Unfortunately, these sorts of attacks are becoming more frequent. They're here to stay." President Joe Biden has been briefed on the ransomware attack and the F.B.I. said it's working closely with Colonial Pipeline and government partners to address the situation. The Department of Energy is leading the federal response, according to Colonial. The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is coordinating with the company. Colonial said it learned Friday that it "was the victim of a cybersecurity attack" and has since shut down 5,500 miles of pipeline that carry nearly half of the fuel supplies on the East Coast, raising fears of spot shortages of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. The pipeline is the largest refined products pipeline in the nation, according to Colonial. "It's an all hands on decks effort right now," Raimondo said. "We're working closely with the company, state and local officials to make sure that they get back up to normal operations as quickly as possible and there aren't disruptions to supply." The company connects refineries on the Gulf Coast to more than 50 million people in the southern and eastern U.S., according to its website. The ultimate impact of the attack on fuel prices is unclear since there's no timeline for Colonial to resume operations, according to Bernadette Johnson, senior vice president of power and renewables at Enverus. Johnson predicted a short-term spike in refined product prices given a short-term outage. "Refined product storage in both the USGC and Northeast can mitigate the impact of a short term event," Johnson said Saturday. But If the shutdown persists, the country could see shortages of fuel develop rapidly, according to John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York. Kilduff predicted that gas prices will skyrocket on the open of futures trading Sunday evening if the company's operations don't resume by then. Johnson agreed: "If this outage were to persist for a significant amount of time, there would be product shortfalls in the Northeast and a glut of product in the USGC, which would impact prices across the country," she said. Jay Hatfield, founder and CEO of Infrastructure Capital Management in New York, said a temporary outage will likely drive already rising national retail gas prices over $3 per gallon for the first time since 2014. Gas futures gained 0.6% to settle at $2.1269 a gallon and diesel futures rose 1.1% to settle at $2.0106 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday. — CNBC's Pippa Stevens contributed to this report
A smart and targeted federal package to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure is a tremendous opportunity to make America competitive for the 21st century, but once again Republican and Democratic leaders are far apart on the details. Fortunately, I believe there is a clear path for a common-sense infrastructure compromise.	One of the things that has always made America exceptional is that when we see something that's broken, we go out and fix it — or at least we try to. However, over the last few decades, while America's infrastructure has crumbled and gradually fallen behind the rest of the world, Washington has been too bogged down by toxic politics and partisan dysfunction to address this urgent priority that impacts every single American's daily life. A smart and targeted federal package to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure is a tremendous opportunity to make America competitive for the 21st century, but once again Republican and Democratic leaders are far apart on the details. While President Joe Biden has released a $2.3 trillion proposal that reads like a wish list of the far left and defines infrastructure as everything under the sun, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has expressed support for a $600 billion to $800 billion package that is limited to only traditional infrastructure like roads and bridges . Fortunately, I believe there is a clear path for a common-sense infrastructure compromise. As chairman of the National Governors Association, I led a yearlong initiative focused on rebuilding America's crumbling infrastructure. Based on the input of governors from both parties, we released a series of recommendations for a federal infrastructure bill. Unlike the Biden proposal, our framework is actually targeted towards real, physical infrastructure, but unlike the current Republican plan, we recognized that the infrastructure of the 21st century must also include investments in the future like broadband, grid modernization, resiliency and clean energy that will grow our economy and enhance our national security. I believe this approach would attract bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. Last month, I hosted an unprecedented summit in Maryland's historic capital of Annapolis that brought together a bipartisan group of over 20 governors, U.S. senators, and members of Congress to discuss how we can find common ground on a bipartisan federal infrastructure package. Although we come from different parties and different levels of government, we came together in the shared conviction that any infrastructure bill will only be successful if both parties have a stake in its success. At the conclusion of the summit, there was unanimous support for an infrastructure bill that invests in "physical assets, broadband, and energy technologies to position America to create good jobs and out-innovate our competitors around the globe in the 21st century." When the Biden plan is narrowed to fit this more targeted scope, the price tag comes to a midpoint between the Democratic and Republican proposals. Of course, that still doesn't resolve how to pay for it. But, even on this sticking point, there are common-sense solutions that have wide support in both parties. In Maryland, instead of raising taxes, we've successfully leveraged public-private partnerships to finance transformative projects, including major road improvements to the Capital Beltway and building a new light rail line in the Washington, D.C., metro area. Right now, there are trillions of dollars sitting on the sidelines that private-sector leaders are anxious to invest in infrastructure projects. We don't have to choose between doing nothing and passing massive tax hikes that would make America less competitive. Public-private partnerships have support from Republican and Democratic governors and have been endorsed by the House Problem Solvers Caucus — the largest bipartisan bloc in Congress. The reality is that none of America's greatest challenges can be solved by one party or one level of government alone. The greatest barrier to a bipartisan infrastructure bill isn't disagreements on policy. There is no such thing as a Republican bridge or a Democratic tunnel. The greatest barrier is mistrust. After years of escalating partisanship, too few trust the other side of the aisle to deal in good faith. And Americans are stuck paying the price in tires destroyed by potholes, hours lost due to delayed trains, and kids struggling to do their homework with inadequate broadband. If we are going to meet the needs of the 21st century, then we have to break down the walls of mistrust that are at the root of Washington's dysfunction. And if we can't begin to do that on infrastructure — an issue where both parties agree more than they disagree — then it's hard to imagine where it can ever be accomplished. In Maryland, we've already shown a better path. While Washington has been playing to the ideological extremes, I've found common ground with my overwhelmingly Democratic legislature, including passing the largest tax cut in state history to provide relief for struggling families and small businesses with near unanimous support, rebuilding roads, bridges, tunnels and transit, expanding broadband and investing in the grid, green energy and resiliency. The question is not whether there is common ground to be found. The question is whether there still exists the will and the political courage to achieve it. Forging a bipartisan compromise on these issues will not be easy, but it can and it must be done. Larry Hogan is the Republican governor of Maryland.
The attack, carried out by the criminal cyber group known as DarkSide, forced the company to shut down approximately 5,500 miles of pipeline. President Joe Biden said that since the attack that struck the jugular of America's pipeline system, he has received regular briefings on the matter.	WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden said Monday that his administration was prepared to take additional steps as the energy sector grapples with a colossal cyberattack targeting one of the largest fuel pipelines in the nation. On Friday, Colonial Pipeline paused its operations and notified federal agencies that it had fallen victim to a ransomware attack. The assault, carried out by the criminal cyber group known as DarkSide , forced the company to shut down approximately 5,500 miles of pipeline, leading to a disruption of nearly half of the nation's East Coast fuel supply. Ransomware attacks involve malware that encrypts files on a device or network that results in the system becoming inoperable. Criminals behind these types of cyberattacks typically demand a ransom in exchange for the release of data. The Department of Energy is leading the federal government response in coordination with the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense. A spokeswoman for FireEye Mandiant confirmed to CNBC that the U.S. cybersecurity firm was working with Colonial Pipeline after the incident. Biden said that since the attack that struck the jugular of America's pipeline system, he has received regular briefings on the matter. The president said that his administration does not have intelligence to support claims that Moscow directed the ransomware attack. He added that he would still discuss the situation with Russian President Vladimir Putin . "So far there is no evidence from our intelligence people that Russia is involved although there is evidence that the actor's ransomware is in Russia, they have some responsibility to deal with this," Biden said from the White House. The Kremlin has previously denied claims that it has launched cyberattacks against the United States. Earlier Monday, White House national security officials described the attack as financially motivated in nature. Biden administration officials, however, would not say if Colonial Pipeline agreed to pay the ransom. "Typically that's a private sector decision," Anne Neuberger, deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technologies, told reporters at the White House when asked about the ransom payment. "We recognize that victims of cyberattacks often face a very difficult situation and they have to just balance often the cost-benefit when they have no choice with regards to paying a ransom. Colonial is a private company and we'll defer information regarding their decision on paying a ransom to them," Neuberger said. She added that the FBI has previously warned victims of ransomware attacks that paying a ransom could encourage further malicious activity. Colonial Pipeline did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Earlier on Monday, the DarkSide group described its actions as "apolitical" in a statement provided to CNBC by Cybereason . "We are apolitical, we do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a defined government and look for our motives," the group wrote. "Our goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society. From today we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future," the statement added. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Monday that the Defense Department was monitoring the nation's fuel supply following concerns that Colonial Pipeline's shutdown could trigger shortages of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Kirby said there were currently no known shortages posed to the U.S. military. Deputy national security advisor Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall told reporters at the White House that the administration did not forecast a fuel shortage. Colonial Pipeline wrote in a statement Monday afternoon that it hopes to restore service by the end of the week . "Actions taken by the Federal Government to issue a temporary hours of service exemption for motor carriers and drivers transporting refined products across Colonial's footprint should help alleviate local supply disruptions and we thank our government partners for their assistance in resolving this matter," the statement added. The Colonial Pipeline attack comes as the Biden administration works to pass a $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan aimed at addressing, in part, America's critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. "Unfortunately, these sorts of attacks are becoming more frequent. They're here to stay. And we have to work in partnership with businesses to secure networks to defend ourselves," Commerce Secretary Gina Marie Raimondo told the CBS Sunday program "Face the Nation ." "It's an all-hands-on-deck effort right now. And we are working closely with the company, state, and local officials to make sure that they get back up to normal operations as quickly as possible, and there aren't disruptions in supply," she said, adding that investing in infrastructure is a top priority for the administration.
President Joe Biden said his administration will distribute more coronavirus relief funds as it aims to help companies hire more workers. While he urged companies to boost wages and make workplaces safe to entice workers, Biden also said people who do not take an offer for a "suitable job" would lose unemployment benefits unless they have a specific coronavirus-related concern. Job growth slowed in April, and Biden disputed the notion that a $300 per week enhanced unemployment benefit deterred Americans from taking jobs.	President Joe Biden on Monday urged U.S. companies to boost pay for workers as he outlined the steps his administration is taking to spur hiring after disappointing job creation in April. The president said his administration will distribute more of the coronavirus relief funds included in Democrats' $1.9 trillion aid plan as reopening businesses search for employees. The federal government will start allowing state and local governments to apply for part of a $350 billion relief pool , push to streamline distribution of aid to child care centers and begin sending grants to 16,000 struggling restaurants and bars, among other efforts. Biden said the White House does not "see much evidence" that the $300 per week federal unemployment benefit in place until September has deterred people from taking jobs, adding that "Americans want to work." Even so, he said, anyone "offered a suitable job must take the job or lose their unemployment benefits" unless they have specific concerns related to Covid-19. The president put the onus on employers who have accepted federal relief to offer good pay, protect workers from the virus and encourage vaccination so Americans feel comfortable taking jobs. "My expectation is that as our economy comes back, these companies will provide fair wages and safe work environments," Biden said in remarks at the White House. "And if they do, they'll find plenty of workers." U.S. nonfarm payrolls grew by 266,000 in April, well below expectations of about 1 million jobs created, as the unemployment rate ticked up to 6.1%. The report Friday raised questions about how companies can entice workers in a reopening economy and what role the government should play in encouraging hiring. Biden downplayed the slow growth, saying the economy is "moving in the right direction." Yet the president has said the disappointing data showed the need to increase vaccinations against Covid-19 and pass his infrastructure and economic recovery plans. Democrats have said parts of his proposals, including provisions to expand affordable child care and paid leave, will make it easier for parents to accept jobs. Increasing child care capacity, reopening schools and boosting the rate of vaccinations should help to mitigate hiring issues, Biden said Monday. Republicans and business organizations have questioned the need for the $300 per week enhanced federal unemployment benefit as much of the country prepares to lift economic restrictions. The payments were extended as part of Democrats' $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package. Critics of the enhanced benefits contend they discourage Americans from taking jobs that may not pay them as much as unemployment insurance does. A lack of child-care options for job seekers and safety concerns as the virus lingers have likely played a major role , as well. A White House fact sheet released Monday said "workers may not turn down a job due to a general, non-specific concern about COVID-19 and continue to receive benefits." People could reject an offer and keep receiving unemployment if they have a child at home who cannot go to school due to the virus, or if an employer does not comply with federal or state health standards, among other reasons, the administration said. As Democrats draft economic recovery legislation and Biden prepares for negotiations with Republicans , the president's plans may not get through Congress for weeks or months. The White House may also have to scale back the proposals to win approval in the Capitol, even under special budget rules that would require only Democratic votes. Another Biden priority that could make employers boost wages — a $15-per-hour federal minimum wage — did not make it into the coronavirus aid package earlier this year. A standalone bill to boost the pay floor faces long odds of Senate approval. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
States and local governments will have significant leeway in deciding how to spend the $350 billion in Covid-19 relief funds, according to the Treasury Department. Officials said states and territories are not allowed to use the funding to offset tax cuts or make a deposit to a pension fund. Additionally, state governments will receive their funding in either one or two payments based on their respective unemployment rates.	States and local governments will have significant leeway in deciding how to spend the $350 billion in Covid-19 relief funds authorized by President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan. The Treasury Department said Monday that governments will be compelled to spend the cash infusion "to meet pandemic response needs and rebuild a strong, more equitable economy." But importantly, Treasury officials said states and territories are not allowed to use the funding to offset lost revenue as the result of a tax cut or make a deposit to a pension fund. Senior administration officials said on Monday that approved uses for the funds are intentionally broad and flexible. "Every state and city are different," Deputy Treasury Secretary Adewale "Wally" Adeyemo told reporters Monday. "In the coming days and weeks, Treasury's Office of Recovery Programs will work hand-in-hand with governors, mayors, members of Congress and other local officials to answer any questions and ensure funds are making it to communities as soon as possible." Of the $350 billion total, state governments and the District of Columbia will receive $195.3 billion, counties will receive $65.1 billion, cities will receive $45.6 billion and tribal governments and territories will receive $24.5 billion. Additionally, state governments will receive their funding in either one or two payments based on their respective unemployment rates. States that have experienced a net increase in their unemployment rate of more than 2 percentage points from February 2020 to the latest available data will receive their funds in a single payment. All other states will receive the funding in two equal tranches. Counties, cities and tribal governments can apply and be certified for the federal funds via a Treasury website and see payments in as soon as a few days. "Today is a milestone in our country's recovery from the pandemic and its adjacent economic crisis," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a press release. "With this funding, communities hit hard by COVID-19 will able to return to a semblance of normalcy; they'll be able to rehire teachers, firefighters and other essential workers — and to help small businesses reopen safely," she added. But governments are barred from depositing money into pension funds, which became a key worry of Republicans in Congress. Democrats slipped the prevention into Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan just before Capitol Hill approved the legislation after several moderates expressed concerns that some states could seize the funds to approve tax cuts or fund retirement plans. Approved expenditures for the $350 billion include supporting public health expenditures, addressing the negative economic impact caused by Covid-19, replacing lost public-sector revenue or investing in water, sewer and broadband infrastructure. Governments can also elect to earmark funds to provide premium pay for essential workers. Officials noted that while some states or local governments may opt to use the funds for select infrastructure projects, the current allocations are not meant to replace the American Jobs Plan. The Biden administration is trying to persuade lawmakers to support two more multitrillion-dollar stimulus plans. The White House bills its $2 trillion American Jobs Plan as a once-in-a-generation infrastructure overhaul with hundreds of billions of dollars earmarked for road repair, fixes to the nation's waterways and the developments of climate-friendly energy. The other is the American Families Plan, a $1.8 trillion collection of spending and tax breaks aimed at encouraging education, reducing child-care costs and supporting national paid family leave.
Mitch McConnell said he thinks an infrastructure package should cost between $600 billion and $800 billion. The Senate minority leader is set to discuss infrastructure when he meets with President Joe Biden and top congressional leaders Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy on Wednesday. Biden has backed $2.3 trillion in infrastructure spending, and Democrats and Republicans have disagreed on what constitutes infrastructure and how they should pay for it.	Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said an infrastructure plan should cost no more than $800 billion, setting down a marker ahead of a critical week for efforts to craft a bill that would refresh U.S. transportation, broadband and water systems. "The proper price tag for what most of us think of as infrastructure is about 6-to-800 billion dollars," the Kentucky Republican told his state's PBS TV station KET on Sunday , again criticizing President Joe Biden for putting what he called unrelated items in his $2.3 trillion proposal. McConnell outlined his desired spending cap ahead of Biden's first meeting with the top four congressional leaders on Wednesday. The president is expected to discuss infrastructure with McConnell, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Biden will then meet with six Republican senators to talk about a potential compromise on Thursday. One of those lawmakers, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, led a $568 billion GOP infrastructure proposal last month. Capito on Friday signaled Republicans could agree to a larger package. She told NBC News that the GOP plan "is not our final offer." The parties would have to settle fundamental disputes to strike an infrastructure deal. Biden, Schumer and Pelosi have indicated they could forge ahead with legislation on their own in the Democratic-held Congress if Republicans — many of whom see blocking the president's priorities as their best path to retaking the Capitol in the 2022 midterms — are reluctant to compromise. The president will also meet with Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Tom Carper, D-Del., about infrastructure on Monday, according to The Associated Press. Democrats would need Manchin's support to pass a bill with a simple majority through special budget rules in a Senate split 50-50 by party. He has expressed doubts about backing more massive spending plans, and said he prefers a 25% corporate tax rate to Biden's desired 28%. Biden's plan includes $400 billion to bolster care for elderly and disabled Americans, along with investments in housing and electric vehicles. Republicans do not consider those policies infrastructure. The parties also back different methods to pay for the infrastructure improvements. Democrats want to raise the corporate tax rate to at least 25% from 21%, the level set under the 2017 GOP tax plan. Republicans are prepared to oppose any changes to their law. GOP senators have floated electric vehicle user fees or a diversion of state and local coronavirus relief funds as means to offset infrastructure costs. McConnell also said Sunday that the existing gas tax could raise money for investments. The Senate minority leader said he opposed "revisiting the tax bill in a way that creates additional problems for the economy." Sluggish hiring in April also complicated Biden's push to pass the $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan and an additional $1.8 trillion proposal to strengthen child care, education, paid leave and tax credits for families. The president on Friday said the jobs report shows the need to vaccinate more Americans against Covid-19 and pass what he called "vital" recovery bills. Republicans have said the $300-per-week enhanced unemployment benefit set to expire in September deterred Americans from taking jobs. The president may rebut those arguments during remarks on the economy set for Monday afternoon. Several other factors could have contributed to slower-than-expected hiring last month. Many parents still have to watch their children during the workday as schools and care facilities reopen. The jobs report led some Democrats to call for immediate investments in child care — which Biden's second recovery plan would address. That legislation may not pass for months, even if it overcomes hurdles to get through Congress. In a statement Friday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said that "if we want moms and dads to go back to work as this pandemic subsides, we need to provide them with the child care they need." Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
Uber and Lyft will offer free rides to vaccination sites until July 4 as part of a new White House partnership, the Biden administration announced Tuesday. The White House said the initiative would launch within the next two weeks. The Biden administration said the program should help to reach the president's goal of vaccinating 70% of U.S. adults with at least one shot by Independence Day.	Uber and Lyft will offer free rides to vaccination sites until July 4 as part of a new White House partnership, the Biden administration announced Tuesday. "By helping Americans get a free ride to a vaccination site, Lyft and Uber are eliminating a potential barrier and driving America closer to the President's goal of getting 70% of the U.S. adult population with at least one shot by July 4th," the White House said in a press release. Both companies had already partnered with other businesses to expand transportation access to Covid vaccination sites, but Tuesday's announcement builds on those commitments and introduces a formal government partnership. The White House said the initiative would launch within the next two weeks. Uber did not immediately provide details of how the the rides would look in its app, but Lyft said a "ride code" will be available through its website or app by May 24. Though the White House advertised the rides as free, Lyft said it would cover $15 of a ride each way. Lyft said in a statement that amount should cover "most, if not all" of the fare based on past rides to vaccination sites it's observed. Users will be able to go to Lyft's website or app to get a code to ride to a nearby vaccination site after giving a few details. The codes can be used for standard rides as well as scooters or bikes offered through Lyft during standard pharmacy hours of 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. "The vaccine is the key to getting us all moving again, and we're proud to do our part to move the country forward," Lyft co-founder and President John Zimmer said in a statement. "We've always believed transportation has the power to improve people's lives, and this initiative makes that truer than ever. Helping more Americans get vaccinated helps the Lyft community of drivers and riders, and we're grateful to the Biden Administration for prioritizing access." "Vaccines are our best hope to beat this pandemic and soon everyone in America will be able to take a free Uber to get their shot," Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement. "We are honored to deepen our previous global commitments, and partner with the White House and Lyft to provide free rides to vaccination sites across the US. This is a proud moment for me, for Uber, and for our country." Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube. WATCH: Uber, Lyft pledge millions to fight driver shortage
President Joe Biden is holding high-profile meetings this week with a bipartisan group of senators whose input could shape the outlines of any final bill. Right now, there are no visible areas of overlap between the Democratic and Republican infrastructure funding plans. In the House, rank-and-file Democrats question whether their Republican colleagues really want a bipartisan compromise.	WASHINGTON — The clock is ticking this week on President Joe Biden's goal of reaching an agreement with congressional Republicans to support some, if not all, of his wide-ranging infrastructure proposal. After weeks of outreach by White House aides to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the president is holding high-profile meetings this week with influential senators, both Republicans and Democrats, whose input could shape the outlines of any final bill. There are a number of reasons to be cautiously optimistic that Biden can reach an agreement with Republicans, especially if he agrees to split the massive $1.8 trillion American Jobs Plan package into two or more separate bills. But with each passing day, the partisan divide grows deeper over how to pay for the much-needed infrastructure investments. Democrats have so far rejected a Republican proposal to fund the plan through user fees, with White House officials saying this amounts to a tax hike on middle-class Americans who drive. Instead, Democrats propose raising the corporate tax rate and closing loopholes that would effectively mean corporations and the very richest Americans pay for the plan. But Republicans say any changes to the low tax rates enacted in their 2017 tax-cut bill are a nonstarter. So where does that leave the prospects of a bipartisan bill? Advocates and analysts on both sides of the aisle agree: Right now, there are no visible areas of overlap between the Democratic and Republican funding plans. Under any other president, this would render any hopes of a compromise bill effectively DOA. But with Biden in charge, they say, the math is different. "We've never had a president spend this much time and political capital on infrastructure," said Kevin DeGood, who leads the infrastructure policy team at the progressive Center for American Progress. "I'm cautiously optimistic about a compromise bill because it's a personal priority of the president's," said Republican strategist Michael Steel, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies and a former top aide to then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. On Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki reaffirmed that the search for a bipartisan compromise is coming directly from Biden himself. "He is quite open, as is evidenced by the fact that he invited Sen. [Shelley Moore] Capito and a group of members to meet with him in the White House later this week. He's very open to having a discussion about it: where we can find agreement, where we can move forward." After meeting on Monday with Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Tom Carper of Delaware, the president is expected to discuss infrastructure at a joint meeting Wednesday with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Biden will then meet with six Republican senators, including Capito, to talk about a potential compromise on Thursday. Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, led a $568 billion GOP infrastructure proposal last month. Still, there are doubts that Biden's enthusiasm for a deal can paper over the deep divisions between the two parties' priorities. "The two sides are still extremely far apart, not only on the topline spending but also on the guts of the respective plans and what they're trying to achieve," DeGood told CNBC. Biden's proposal features hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for traditional infrastructure projects, such as roads and bridge repair. But it also includes billions more in spending to expand the electrical grid, bolster care for elderly and disabled Americans, invest in affordable housing and expand broadband access. And Biden so far refuses to agree to any funding for the plan that would contribute to the federal deficit, insisting that any provisions in a bill be paid for upfront. Republicans have seized on Biden's expansive definition of "infrastructure" to oppose much of his proposal. In April, Republican senators released the framework of a counteroffer infrastructure bill that would cost about a quarter of what Biden is proposing . Republicans also say that Biden's refusal to fund the plan by imposing user fees, or deficit spend, is unsustainable. "I don't understand why infrastructure needs to be paid for within the bill," said Steel, the Republican strategist. "With low interest rates right now, why should it be verboten to make these improvements that will grow the economy, and to finance it with some spending?" he said. As for the Democratic proposal to raise the corporate tax rate, Steel said Republicans are united in their opposition. "I don't see tax hikes. At all. And Republicans are going to see closing any tax loopholes as a tax hike," he said. As negotiations continue this week, Biden has said he has only two red lines: inaction, and tax hikes on people making less than $400,000. But many rank-and-file Democrats are suspicious of the motives of their GOP colleagues. "Dealing with infrastructure and the Republicans always feels like Lucy and the football to me, with Charlie Brown. Every time we get close, they kind of pull the football away," Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., said Monday on MSNBC. Sherrill also noted that her concern "has less to do with the top line [funding] number, and more to do with what's in the package." The longer the negotiations continue, the greater the chances that unrelated events will shift Biden's hand one way or another. April's disappointing jobs numbers, which came out Friday, served to bolster the administration's case in recent days for why a sweeping job creation bill is needed right now. According to DeGood at the Center for American Progress, April's sluggish job growth gives Democrats "even more impetus to stick with this fight, because this is their signature domestic job creation bill." Biden has previously said that 75% of the jobs his American Jobs Plan would create are for people who have only a high school diploma. Also impacting the public debate over infrastructure this week is the news that one of America's largest energy pipeline operators, Colonial Pipeline, has been crippled by a ransomware cyberattack. On Monday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNBC the attack highlights the unique vulnerabilities of our current infrastructure and why it needs to be shored up. "Twentieth-century infrastructure is going to be especially vulnerable, and it's why we need to be planning to future-proof the assets that we have around the country," said Buttigieg. Biden has set an unofficial deadline of Memorial Day for reaching a deal with Republicans. If Biden fails to reach a bipartisan compromise on the plan, he and congressional Democrats have said they will use budget reconciliation to pass an infrastructure package on a purely party-line vote, which requires only 51 votes in the Senate.
A New York real estate tax lawyer — who once did work for former President Donald Trump — in 2011 purchased a shell company whose creators later became key investors in a mystery $100 million company that owns only a small New Jersey deli. Europa Acquisition I Inc. was one of eight shell entities set up by Peter Reichard and Peter Coker Sr., the North Carolina investors in deli owner Hometown International. CNBC has detailed criminal and regulatory sanctions imposed on people and entities linked to Coker Sr. and Reichard. Duke and Vanderbilt universities are invested in Hometown International, as are entities based in Macao.	Shell companies sure make strange bedfellows. A New York real estate tax lawyer — who did work for former President Donald Trump decades ago — in 2011 purchased a shell company whose creators later became key investors in a mystery $100 million company that owns just a small New Jersey deli , records show. The shell company — Europa Acquisition I Inc. — was one of eight shell entities set up in 2010 by Peter Reichard and Peter Coker Sr., the North Carolina-based investors in deli owner Hometown International . After Reichard and Coker sold them, most of those shell companies — including the one later purchased by Trump's former real estate tax lawyer Allan Schwartz — ended up having their registrations revoked by the Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to keep current in their disclosure filings, records show. The shell companies were named in numerical sequence, starting with Europa Acquisition I and ending with Europa Acquisition VIII. Schwartz, the former Trump lawyer, told CNBC in a phone interview that he knew nothing about Coker Sr. and Reichard, Hometown International, or its deli in Paulsboro, New Jersey, which has minuscule sales. Coker Sr. and Reichard sold the Europa shell months before Schwartz bought it from other entities. Schwartz, 73, is the latest person with an eyebrow-raising history to pop up in financial records linked to the deli company investors or to entities they were involved in. "I know nothing about it," Schwartz said Monday after a reporter told him that key investors in Hometown International had created a shell company he once owned. Schwartz laughed when he was told details about Hometown International, including its market valuation of $100 million despite it owning only a South Jersey deli that had sales of less than $37,000 for the past two years. Schwartz is in good company. A lot of people have laughed or made jokes about Hometown International since last month , when hedge fund manager David Einhorn first highlighted the deli owner's preposterous market capitalization and used it as a warning to retail investors. "The pastrami must be amazing," Einhorn quipped in an oft-quoted line from that letter. In recent weeks, CNBC has detailed criminal and regulatory sanctions imposed on people and entities linked to Coker Sr. and Reichard, reported on the investments by Duke and Vanderbilt universities in Hometown International and revealed details about the opaque nature of a group of Macao-based investors in that company. Articles also have explored the incongruous professional backgrounds of Hometown's two executive officers — both of whom are public high school administrators — and the existence of a related shell company. That shell company, E-Waste , like the deli owner , has a sky-high stock market capitalization that is not justified by any meaningful business operations. Those articles led to the termination of consulting agreements in which Hometown International and E-Waste had paid thousands of dollars per month in fees to a firm controlled by Reichard and Coker Sr. Another firm controlled by the two men, Europa Capital Investments, remains a major investor in Hometown International, as does Coker Sr. as an individual. Coker Sr.'s son, Hong Kong-based Peter Coker Jr., is the deli company's chairman. Both Hometown International and E-Waste in recent weeks took the extraordinary step of telling the SEC in a filing that their relatively high stock prices are unjustified. That move came after OTC Markets Group in late April demoted the deli owner's stock from one over-the-counter trading platform to a less prestigious platform. OTC Markets said that move, and its imposition of a "buyer beware" warning label on Hometown International stock, were warranted by "irregularities" in public disclosures filed by the company. Records reviewed in recent days by CNBC show that a now-disbarred lawyer — who last year pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges related to a shell company factory scheme — also was involved in the creation of the Europa Acquisition shells for Coker Sr. and Reichard. That same lawyer three years later played a similar role in the creation of Hometown International and later securities filings for that company. SEC records show that the accounting firm involved during the registration of the Europa Acquisition shell companies was an earlier incarnation of a Florida-based firm that handled accounting work for Hometown International. The Florida firm itself was censured last year by an accounting oversight board for lack of oversight in work for a company that is not connected to either the deli owner or to the Europa shell companies. CNBC last week obtained from the Raleigh Police Department in North Carolina a record of Coker Sr.'s arrest on April 30, 2010, on a charge of soliciting a prostitute, who herself was arrested that day. That arrest came nearly 18 years after Coker Sr. was reportedly arrested in Allentown, Pennsylvania — where he had been a high school basketball star — on prostitution and other charges. The Morning Call newspaper at the time reported that Coker, then 49, was nabbed by police after allegedly exposing himself to three girls, one as young as 10 years old, and trying to proposition them. "Yes," Coker Sr. said when he answered his phone Monday and was told that a reporter was calling. "Thanks, but no," he said when told that CNBC was preparing to publish another article about him. He then hung up after a reporter asked if he would listen to details of that article. Coker, 78, previously was accused in lawsuits of hiding assets from a bank that he owed nearly $900,000 , and of business-related fraud . He denied those allegations at the time of the lawsuits. The 64-year-old Reichard, who was sued along with Coker Sr. in 2019 in a now-settled case regarding alleged business fraud involving a specialty foods retailer in North Carolina, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. His lawyer in the lawsuit had denied the plaintiff's claims of wrongdoing at the time the case was filed. In late 2011, Reichard was convicted in North Carolina court of a criminal scheme that illegally contributed thousands of dollars to the successful campaign of Bev Perdue, a Democrat, for governor of that state in 2008. The scheme involved the use of bogus consulting contracts with Tryon Capital, a firm controlled by Reichard and Coker Sr. The elder Coker was not charged in that case. Tryon Capital is the same firm that until last month was being paid $15,000 a month by Hometown International for a consulting agreement and $2,500 per month by E-Waste for a similar agreement. In financial filings, Hometown International and E-Waste have indicated that they are marketing themselves as candidates for reverse mergers or other financial maneuvers, which would have them effectively taken over by a private company that wants to become publicly traded in the United States. Investments by outside entities in the past year, including ones linked to Duke and Vanderbilt that were placed by a Hong Kong-based investment firm, in both companies were meant to bolster that effort. But the investments do not explain the bizarre steep rise of share prices of both Hometown International and E-Waste in the past year, particularly since E-Waste has no actual business. Both stocks are thinly traded, at best, each day. They also, despite having millions of common stock shares outstanding, have relatively few shareholders, the largest of which are entities involved in the plan to have the companies merge with other firms. If that plan is successful, shareholders are expected to receive a return on their investment that bears little, if any, resemblance to the current share prices of either company. All of those facts raise the question of why anyone would pay so much now to buy shares of the companies on the open market. Adding to the oddness is the fact that the CEO of the deli owner, 62-year-old Paul Morina, is the principal of Paulsboro High School and the head coach of the school's renowned wrestling team . The only other executive is Christine Lindemuth, 46, an administrator and a teacher at the same high school, which is close to the deli. E-Waste's only executive, 66-year-old New Jersey resident John Rollo, is a Grammy-winning music recording engineer who last year worked as a patient transporter at a New Jersey hospital . The eight Europa Acquisition shell companies were set up by Reichard and Coker Sr. as so-called blank check companies to become vehicles for transactions like those being sought by Hometown International and E-Waste, according to SEC filings. Several of the shells actually ended up being used for that purpose, in transactions that ended with them being controlled by China-based companies. Those filings show that Europa Acquisition I was incorporated in Nevada in June 2010 and a month later filed a registration of securities with the SEC, as did four other Europa shells. The three highest-numbered Europa shells were registered with the SEC in December 2010. In 2020, Gregg Jaclin, the lawyer named on the Europa Acquisition company filings, pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges related to his creation of shell companies to sell to individuals "who use those shell companies as publicly traded vehicles for market manipulation schemes," court records show. None of the companies involved in that scheme were the Europa Acquisition shells. Nor were they Hometown International, whose first SEC filings lists Jaclin as a lawyer for that corporation. Jaclin, who was disbarred as a lawyer and sanctioned by the SEC for his actions, did not respond to requests for comment. The July 2010 registration filing for Europa Acquisition I said that Reichard, who served as its president and director, held 60,000 shares of the company, while Coker Sr. held the remaining 40,000 shares. That share split between the business partners was mirrored in other initial filings by Europa shells. Less than three months later, Reichard and Coker sold all of their shares for $15,000 to two companies, Beige Holdings and Marlin Financial Group, filings show. One of Schwartz's sons, Gregory, then was appointed as president of Europa Acquisition I, filings state. Then, in January 2011, Allan Schwartz himself paid $18,750 for 90%, or 90,000 shares, of the company, while Beige Holdings retained 10,000 shares. "I had no doubt that I bought a quiet, clean shell company," Allan Schwartz said in a phone interview. Schwartz said that he purchased Europa Acquisition I — his first and only shell company — "with the hope that we could do something with it," along the lines of a merger with a small company and possibly an additional issuance of stock. But, he said, "it never did anything," after several years of Schwartz paying thousands of dollars annually to maintain the existence of the company, which at some point he renamed Wintahenderson International. "At a certain point, I said that's the end of it," recalled Schwartz. "We just let the company go out of business." Wintahenderson last filed a required quarterly report with the SEC in 2017, according to the regulator's online database. Last September, the SEC revoked Wintahenderson's registration for failing to file required periodic reports. The SEC had taken similar action for the same reason against most of the other Europa Acquisition shells years earlier. Schwartz currently is senior counsel and senior managing partner at the Manhattan firm of Podell, Schwartz, Schecter & Banfield , which represents property owners seeking to reduce their property taxes. Schwartz's current firm, which is a leader in real estate tax work, merged in 1997 with his prior firm, Schwartz & Weiss. "At one point in time our firm did represent Trump, but that's going back 27 years or more," Schwartz said. "I don't think I represented Trump for more than two, three years," Schwartz said. "I think I met him once in his office at Trump Tower ... 99% of the time I was dealing with someone in his office." At some point, Schwartz said, Trump "switched real estate tax attorneys." "Sometimes clients choose to go with another firm," Schwartz said. "Maybe he wasn't happy, and he changes lawyers." Schwartz said that decades ago a former New York City tax assessor and city Tax Commission hearing officer named Thomas McArdle may have done some work for his law firm after becoming a consultant. But Schwartz said that he had "zero recollection" of McArdle performing any work in connection with Trump's properties for Schwartz's firm. In 2002, The New York Times reported that McArdle was a key figure in a federal indictment filed against 18 other then-current and former city tax assessors , who were charged in a decades-long scheme with accepting millions of dollars in bribes in exchange for lowering property taxes for commercial property owners. Prosecutors said at the time that the scheme had cost New York City $160 million in lost tax revenue during the prior four years alone. McArdle, who died in 2013 , was never charged in that case but was identified in news reports as a cooperating witness in the investigation. In a 2002 Times article, Schwartz's then-lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, acknowledged that Schwartz had worked for Trump in the past, but added that "it did not involve Mr. McArdle, to our knowledge.'' ''McArdle was an industrywide consultant who was used by the most prominent and well-respected law firms and real estate firms in the city,'' Brafman said at the time. Brafman also said Schwartz was "not aware of any wrongdoing by McArdle" or anyone else. The Times reported at the time that Trump told the newspaper that "he stopped using Mr. Schwartz in the early 1990s because he seemed ineffectual." Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump, did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC. Schwartz on Monday told CNBC that he was aware nearly two decades ago that "there was a scandal" around McArdle. But he also said that he was not personally aware of any wrongdoing by McArdle in connection with his work for Schwartz's firm. In March 2020, an article by ProPublica and WNYC radio reported that five former city tax assessors and city employees, as well as a former Trump Organization employee, had said that the Trump Organization paid bribes, using middlemen, to city tax assessors to lower its property tax bills for several Manhattan buildings in the 1980s and 1990s. The city employees interviewed for that article were among those 18 who all pleaded guilty in the scheme said to involve McArdle. CNBC has reached out for comment to the Trump Organization. Last year, the Trump Organization's chief legal officer, Alan Garten, denied the allegations. "To be clear, at no time did the Trump Organization or any of its employees or principals ever pay anyone for the purpose of unlawfully obtaining a lower tax valuation," he told ProPublica and WNYC for their article. "This was corroborated by multiple investigations which found no evidence of any wrongdoing by the company or any of its principals. ... If anything, the Trump Organization was a victim of the scandal," Garten said. Trump and his company currently are the subjects of a criminal investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. Vance's office among other things is eyeing allegations that the Trump Organization manipulated the valuation of certain real estate properties to lower their tax bill and insurance costs and to receive more favorable terms from lenders. New York State Attorney General Letitia James is conducting a civil investigation of the Trump Organization that is focused on those same allegations . The claims were first raised during testimony to Congress in 2019 by Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer , who is cooperating with Vance's investigation. Trump, a Republican, has denied any wrongdoing and also has claimed that both investigations are "witch hunts" by Vance and James, both of whom are Democrats. Among the Trump properties being eyed in both probes is 40 Wall Street, a skyscraper in lower Manhattan. Schwartz said that he represented the owners of 40 Wall Street before it was sold to Trump. He also said that he never represented Trump in connection with that building. The lawyer said that no one from either Vance's or James' office has contacted him to ask about his work for Trump. Schwartz said he has no reason to believe that Trump or his company misstated the incomes of their properties in their appeals of city assessment rulings, which if successful led to a reduction in tax liabilities. He noted that property owners "must submit certified statements of income and expenses on their tax commission forms." "That's the basis on which real estate attorneys argue" for lower assessments, he said. "Do I think he submitted phony statements?" Schwartz said. "I would suspect no, but I have no idea. I don't know, nor would I have any reason to suspect that he did." Schwartz was bemused and spoke matter-of-factly about his link to Trump. "I can't dispute the facts, but it's funny that there are so many facts that are related to each other," Schwartz said. "Everything that you discussed is in the public record." He added: "Of all the characters you've mentioned, the only one I can tell you that I knew was Trump, for a short period of time. And McArdle." In addition to having worked for Trump, Schwartz at one point had an office in the Villard Houses in Manhattan, a historic landmark owned by the Sultan of Brunei, on land leased from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. Schwartz's office there was one floor below the office of the mysterious money manager Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex criminal who killed himself in 2019 while in a Manhattan jail awaiting trial on federal child sex trafficking charges. Epstein was a former friend of Trump's, as well as of another former president, Bill Clinton . "Never met him," Schwartz said of Epstein. "I never saw him in the building."
The Senate Rules Committee deadlocked along partisan lines in a vote to advance the Democratic-backed For the People Act, a sweeping elections reform bill that will influence registration, voting, campaign finance and congressional redistricting. Democrats will need a simple majority vote, which will require support from all of their members, to bring the legislation to the floor in the Senate split 50-50 by party. The committee held a hearing on the legislation, during which Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called it necessary to combat restrictive voting laws and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell cast it as a power grab. Unified opposition from Republicans and skepticism from at least one Democrat makes the bill's passage unlikely.	Senate Democrats took the first step Tuesday toward advancing a sweeping federal election reform bill, calling it vital to combating a wave of restrictive voting proposals around the country. The chamber's Rules Committee deadlocked in a 9-9, party-line vote on whether to send a version of the House-passed For the People Act to the Senate floor. Democrats can advance the bill with a majority in the evenly split chamber — which could require a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Kamala Harris. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has insisted he will bring the plan to the chamber floor. The legislation aims to create automatic voter registration, expand early voting, require more disclosures from political donors and curb partisan gerrymandering, among a bevy of changes. It has little chance of getting through the full Senate. Republicans have opposed the legislation, calling it a federal takeover of locally administered elections. Lacking GOP votes, Democrats appear boxed in from passing the bill on their own. They cannot use special budget rules that allow certain legislation to pass with a simple majority, and do not have the support within their party to scrap the 60-vote filibuster threshold. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., has also criticized the bill, arguing Congress should make election reforms on a bipartisan basis. Underscoring the bill's significance, Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., testified at a contentious committee hearing Tuesday. The Democratic leader called the plan necessary to combat laws passed in Georgia, Florida and elsewhere that critics say will disproportionately impede the right to vote for people of color. The moves to restrict voting followed former President Donald Trump's persistent, unfounded claims that widespread fraud caused him to lose the 2020 election. The claims led a mob of Trump's supporters to overrun the Capitol on Jan. 6 while lawmakers counted President Joe Biden's electoral win. "Republican legislatures have seized on the big lie to restrict the franchise, and inevitably make it harder for African Americans, Latinos, students and the working poor to vote," Schumer said. "Here in the 21st century, we are witnessing an attempt at the greatest contraction of voting rights since the end of Reconstruction and the beginning of Jim Crow." McConnell again downplayed the effects of the restrictive state laws, which sparked lawsuits from voting rights groups and criticism from major corporations and CEOs. He decried what he called "hysterical attacks" on the Georgia measures, which set strict identification requirements for absentee ballots and limits drop-off boxes, among other provisions criticized by voting-rights advocates. The Republican leader also pointed out that Democrats first moved to pass the For the People Act in 2019, before the post-2020 election laws took hold. McConnell described the bill as a power grab. "Our democracy is not in crisis," he said. "And we are not going to let one party take over our democracy under the false pretense of saving it." The legislation as passed by the Democratic-held House in March would implement automatic voter registration across the country. It would require states to offer 15 days of early voting and encourage no-excuse absentee voting. The measure would boost public funding of campaigns — which has drawn particular ire from Republicans — and require disclosures from certain political advertisers and donors to "dark money" groups. It would also set up independent redistricting commissions to curb partisan gerrymandering of congressional seats. Democrats have said huge turnout in 2020 showed pandemic-era measures including widespread absentee voting will make it easier for Americans to participate in elections. Voting-rights experts have cheered many pieces of the legislation but some have expressed concerns that the plan would create an administrative mess for state and local officials. Senate Democrats hope to ease those fears through changes they planned to make Tuesday. Senate Rules Committee Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said amendments would give states more time to implement automatic voter registration and same-day registration at polling places. The tweaks would shorten the window for election officials to accept absentee ballots and resolve signature disputes, so they can certify results more quickly. "You can simultaneously make elections fair and secure, while giving voters options that work for them," Klobuchar said Tuesday in pushing for the bill. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
GOP Rep. Liz Cheney is vowing behind the scenes that she will not stop slamming former President Donald Trump for repeating the lie that the election was stolen from him. Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and much of the caucus are on the verge of removing Cheney from a leadership post. Liz Cheney's father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, supports his daughter's stance on Trump, sources say, and has taken part in meetings and talks with key donors and supporters.	GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, who appears likely to be stripped of leadership duties by her fellow House Republicans, does not plan to stop blasting former President Donald Trump for repeating the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him, according to people familiar with the matter. Cheney, a staunch conservative, has been telling key donors and supporters behind the scenes that she is going to continue to hold Trump and the Republican Party accountable for what she has called the "Big Lie," said these people. Her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has been involved in these talks as well, the people said. These people declined to be named in this story in order to speak on a private matter. Her stance is likely going to cost Liz Cheney her spot as GOP conference chair in the House. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has told members to expect a vote on Wednesday to remove Cheney from the position. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is in line to take over that post. Trump, who has ripped Cheney as a "warmonger," has endorsed Stefanik for the role. During a call with her allies and top donors late last month, Cheney said she has no intention of backing down from Trump, according to one of the people with direct knowledge of the matter. She has publicly linked Trump's false claims about the election to the deadly riot on Jan. 6 on Capitol Hill. Cheney, like every other member of the House, is up for reelection next year. Numerous Republicans have announced primary campaigns against her. Cheney was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in the weeks following the deadly insurrection. Many of her top donors told CNBC last week that they plan to stick with Cheney despite the move by Republicans to oust her from her leadership post. The April call included a small group of supporters, including former Vice President Cheney, one person said. While Dick Cheney has been involved with his daughter's campaigns in the past, he now finds himself in the midst of a battle for a party he once led along with former President George W. Bush. Dick Cheney, according to people familiar with this call and other recent private gatherings with him, has indicated he supports his daughter's stance on Trump and the Capitol riot. The April discussion took place before the House Republican retreat and prior to McCarthy publicly taking aim at Cheney in a Fox News interview and other instances. Liz Cheney, in multiple recent private meetings, has told allies that she will likely discuss Trump's election claims on the campaign trail. She has also acknowledged it could be a challenge to persuade at least some Republicans in her state that Trump's claims are, in fact, lies. Trump defeated Democrat Joe Biden in Wyoming by over 43 percentage points in 2020. Cheney was recently censured by the Wyoming Republican Party for her vote to impeach Trump. Representatives for Liz Cheney and Trump did not respond to requests for comment. The Wyoming lawmaker recently wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post calling for the party to move on from Trump. "We Republicans need to stand for genuinely conservative principles, and steer away from the dangerous and anti-democratic Trump cult of personality," Cheney wrote . Still, the apparent unity between Cheney, her father and their associates against Trump and his brand of politics represents an attempt at maintaining power by a faction that seems to have been losing sway in a party that's largely guided by the former commander in chief. Dick Cheney has not publicly condemned Trump's stance on the election. People close to him say there is no sign he's actively lobbying members of Congress to try to help his daughter keep her leadership spot. Liz Cheney, according to Politico , has not been making calls to other Republican officials that could help preserve her position as House GOP chair.
Lawmakers hope to reach an agreement as soon as this week on the creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 invasion of the U.S. Capitol. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has deputized House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson to finalize negotiations with GOP Rep. John Katko, a Democratic aide said. If a deal is struck in time, a bill to create the commission could be brought to the House floor by next week, the aide said.	Lawmakers in the House hope to reach an agreement as soon as this week on the creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 invasion of the U.S. Capitol, a senior Democratic aide told CNBC on Tuesday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has deputized House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., to finalize negotiations with Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., the panel's ranking member, the aide said. If a deal is struck in time, a bill to create the commission could be brought to the House floor by next week, according to the Democratic aide. "As things are fluid, we cannot comment at this time," said Adam Comis, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Committee, in an email. A spokesperson for the committee's GOP minority did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., appeared to confirm later Tuesday that the negotiations were underway. "I believe that that Chairman Thompson and ranking member Katko are working on a bipartisan commission," Hoyer told reporters, adding he believes their discussions are "productive." "Do all the Republicans want to do it? I can't say that but in any event, I'm hopeful that we will get to an agreement that will enjoy bipartisan support," Hoyer said. "And I hope we get to it soon so we can put it on the floor next week." The development on Capitol Hill, first reported by Punchbowl News, follows a monthslong partisan logjam over the details of the 9/11-style investigative panel. Pelosi in February said Congress would establish a commission to look into the deadly Jan. 6 invasion by a mob of former President Donald Trump 's supporters, which derailed efforts to confirm President Joe Biden 's Electoral College victory. But disagreements quickly arose over the initial terms of the commission, which would have included seven Democratic appointees and just four Republicans and would have given the Democrats unilateral power to issue subpoenas. In April, Pelosi said she would agree to split the panel evenly between the two parties and change the rules for issuing subpoenas. Another sticking point is the scope of the probe. Democrats want the commission to focus solely on the Jan. 6 invasion and the circumstances surrounding it, while Republicans have pushed to expand its parameters to include violence at separate protests attributed to far-left instigators. Other investigations into the Capitol riot are already underway. Michael Bolton, inspector general for the U.S. Capitol Police, testified before lawmakers this week about problems with the department's operations in the lead-up to the attack. Pelosi also tasked retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore with leading a review of Capitol security. Honore in March reported deficiencies in Capitol officers' training, staffing and equipment and made numerous recommendations.
Judge Peter Cahill found that Chauvin abused his authority as a police officer when he restrained Floyd last year, and that he treated Floyd with particular cruelty. Still even with the aggravating factors, legal experts have said, Chauvin is unlikely to get more than 30 years when he is sentenced June 25.	A Minnesota judge has ruled that there were aggravating factors in the death of George Floyd, paving the way for a longer sentence for Derek Chauvin, according to an order made public Wednesday. In his ruling, Judge Peter Cahill found that Chauvin abused his authority as a police officer when he restrained Floyd last year, and that he treated Floyd with particular cruelty. Still even with the aggravating factors, legal experts have said, Chauvin is unlikely to get more than 30 years when he is sentenced June 25. Chauvin, who is white, was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for 9 1/2 minutes as the Black man said he couldn't breathe and went motionless. Even though he was found guilty of three counts, under Minnesota statutes he'll only be sentenced on the most serious one — second-degree murder. Under Minnesota sentencing guidelines, he would have faced a presumptive sentence of 12 1/2 years on that count, and Cahill could have sentenced him to as little as 10 years and eight months or as much as 15 years and still stayed within the guideline range. But prosecutors asked for what is known as an upward departure — arguing that Floyd was particularly vulnerable with his hands cuffed behind his back as he was face-down on the ground. They noted that Chauvin held his position even after Floyd became unresponsive and officers knew he had no pulse. Prosecutors also said Chauvin treated Floyd with particular cruelty during the lengthy restraint, saying Chauvin inflicted gratuitous pain and caused psychological distress to Floyd and to bystanders. They also said Chauvin abused his position of authority as a police officer, committed his crime as part of a group of three or more people, and that he pinned Floyd down in the presence of children — including a 9-year-old girl who testified at trial that watching the restraint made her "sad and kind of mad." Cahill agreed with all but one of the prosecutors' arguments. He said prosecutors did not prove that Floyd was particularly vulnerable. Defense attorney Eric Nelson disagreed with the state, saying that prosecutors did not prove that there were aggravating factors. He said Chauvin had legal authority to assist in Floyd's arrest and was authorized under law to use reasonable force. He also said Floyd was not particularly vulnerable, saying he was a large man who was struggling with officers. Nelson also argued Floyd was not treated with particular cruelty, saying that there is no evidence that the assault perpetrated by Chauvin involved gratuitous pain that's not usually associated with second-degree murder. No matter what sentence Chauvin gets, in Minnesota it's presumed that a defendant with good behavior will serve two-thirds of the penalty in prison and the rest on supervised release, commonly known as parole. Chauvin has also been indicted on federal charges alleging he violated Floyd's civil rights, as well as the civil rights of a 14-year-old he restrained in a 2017 arrest. If convicted on those charges, which were unsealed Friday, a federal sentence would be served at the same time as Chauvin's state sentence. The three other former officers involved in Floyd's death were also charged with federal civil rights violations; they await trial in state court on aiding and abetting counts.
"I have asked Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hady Amr to go to the region immediately to meet with Israelis and Palestinians … he will urge, on my behalf and on behalf of President (Joe) Biden, a de-escalation of violence," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Israel said it killed 16 members of the Hamas military wing in a air strike on Gaza on Wednesday and Palestinian militants rained rockets into Israel as global concern mounted over their most intense hostilities in years.	The United States is sending a diplomat to urge Israelis and Palestinians to calm "harrowing" violence, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday, saying Israel had a particular responsibility to avoid civilian casualties. "The images that came out overnight are harrowing," Blinken said. "I have asked Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hady Amr to go to the region immediately to meet with Israelis and Palestinians … he will urge, on my behalf and on behalf of President (Joe) Biden, a de-escalation of violence." Israel said it killed 16 members of the Hamas military wing in a air strike on Gaza on Wednesday and Palestinian militants rained rockets into Israel as global concern mounted over their most intense hostilities in years. Blinken said both sides must reduce violence. He drew a distinction between "a terrorist organization, Hamas, that is indiscriminately raining down rockets in fact targeting civilians, and Israel's response, defending itself." However, he placed a particular responsibility on Israel, saying "I think Israel has an extra burden in trying to do everything they possibly can to avoid civilian casualties, even as it is rightfully responding in defense of the people."
President Joe Biden said he anticipates good news "in the next 24 hours" on the ongoing Colonial Pipeline cyber attack that has disabled fuel deliveries along the East Coast. "I think you're going to hear some good news in next 24 hours. And I think we'll be getting that under control," said Biden. In addition to lifting restrictions on overland fuel transports, Biden said the United States military would be "providing fuel, and with vehicles to get it there, places where it's badly needed."	UPDATE, 5:15PM ET: Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm just announced that Colonial Pipeline is restarting its gas pipeline operations.  WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden on Wednesday said he anticipates good news "in the next 24 hours" on the ongoing Colonial Pipeline cyber attack that has disabled fuel deliveries up and down the East Coast in recent days. "We have been in very, very close contact with Colonial Pipeline, which is the one area you're talking about – one of the reasons gasoline prices are going up," Biden said at an event Wednesday afternoon. "I think you're going to hear some good news in next 24 hours. And I think we'll be getting that under control." The remarks came as Americans in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic faced fuel shortages at the pump starting late Monday, which showed little sign of abating by Wednesday afternoon. Panic buying in some states was exacerbating the supply chain issues. "I have in the meantime made it easier for us to have lifted some of the restrictions on the transportation of fuel, as well as access to the United States military providing fuel, and with vehicles to get it there, places where it's badly needed," said Biden. The latest moves by the Biden administration represent what the White House says is a large-scale government mobilization to respond to the crisis, which began when Colonial informed federal agencies on Friday that it had been the target of a ransomware attack. The administration said Tuesday it would direct a "comprehensive federal response" aimed at restoring and securing U.S. energy supply chains. The assault forced the company to shut down approximately 5,500 miles of pipeline, leading to a disruption of nearly half of the nation's East Coast fuel supply. The attack on Colonial Pipeline has been traced back to a hacker group called the DarkSide, an organized group of hackers set up along the "ransomware as a service" business model. This means the DarkSide hackers develop and market ransomware hacking tools, and sell them to other criminals who then carry out attacks. DarkSide is believed to operate out of Russia, but the White House has said it has no evidence so far that the attack was state-sponsored or directed by the Kremlin. Questions remain around precisely how Colonial Pipeline is resolving the attack, including whether Colonial has paid the ransom that hackers typically demand in these scenarios. White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday refused to answer specific questions about how Colonial Pipeline and the Biden administration are collaborating, but said the company and the relevant agencies are in close cooperation. The Department of Energy is leading the federal government response in coordination with the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense. A spokeswoman for FireEye Mandiant confirmed to CNBC that the U.S. cybersecurity firm was working with Colonial Pipeline after the incident. The national average for a gallon of unleaded gasoline jumped to $2.985 Tuesday, an increase of 6 cents in the past week, according to AAA. Regionally, however,  the price increases were sharper, AAA found . In South Carolina, for instance, gasoline prices were up more than 6 cents since Monday and 13 cents in the past week. In Georgia, drivers were paying $2.87 per gallon Tuesday, an increase of of more than 10 cents in just one day and 17 cents in a week. A rise of 3 more cents per gallon would put the average U.S. selling price at the highest level since November 2014. "We are seeing the full fledged panic at the moment in some of the places I suspected we might see it," said Tom Kloza, head of global energy analysis at OPIS. "There aren't enough drivers to take trucks from terminals that have gasoline to stations. We are seeing a lot of stations running out. Georgia seems to be ground zero." Kloza said he expects gasoline prices to rise, but not spike wildly higher. The bigger issue is that gasoline will be in short supply in the region, since it takes time to replace once the pipeline is switched on and outages could continue.

Sen. Mark Warner is calling for legislation that would require private companies to report cyberattacks to the government. "We have treated cyber unfortunately as an afterthought for a long, long time," said Warner, a former technology investor and Virginia governor. The intelligence committee chairman spoke in the wake of the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline that has sparked gas shortages in several states and raised fears of rising fuel prices.	Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., called on Wednesday for legislation that would require private companies to report cyber attacks to the government in the wake of the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline that has sparked gas shortages in several states and raised fears of rising fuel prices. "We have no actual system in place to make, whether it's Colonial Pipeline or SolarWinds, or any other company, actually mandatorily report that information to the government in real time so that we can have a full-fledged response," the Virginia Democrat said on CNBC's " Squawk Box ." Colonial Pipeline, which supplies about half of the east coast's gasoline, ceased operations on Friday and said it was the victim of a ransomware attack. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has said the hacker group DarkSide is responsible. Warner said mandatory reporting of hacks could be modeled on the National Transportation Safety Board and early warning systems in place in the financial sector. He said the information at firms provide would be kept confidential and subject to limited protection from liability. "We have treated cyber unfortunately as an afterthought for a long, long time," said Warner, a former technology investor and Virginia governor. Warner has previously said his committee is working with White House national security advisors on legislation that would require mandatory reporting of cyber threats. "The number of companies that are getting hit on a regular basis with ransomware attacks and quietly paying in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, I think would shock most folks in business," he added. In addition to mandatory reporting, Warner supports the creation of a rapid response team made up of public and private sector technology experts. He said the team would include the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and firms like Amazon and Microsoft . "We need a real-time reaction team. And unfortunately, we don't have that right now. Cyber is always a boring item until it hits home," Warner said. Virginia is one of at least 17 states to declare a state of emergency as a result of the pipeline hack along with the District of Columbia. The pipeline company has said it expects to restore operations by the end of the week. Warner also addressed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments last month, in an interview on CBS's "60 Minutes," naming cybersecurity as the No. 1 threat to the financial system. Warner said that, as head of the intelligence committee, cyber issues were one of his "top three" concerns. "My concern is this: We see the effect of this ransomware attack against one pipeline. We saw, at the end of last year, the SolarWinds attack, which was generated by Russia, that hit 18,000 companies. Luckily that was only espionage, where they were trying to exfiltrate information," Warner said. "Let's imagine what would happen if we combined — if suddenly you had somebody shutting down 18,000 companies across our economy," Warner added. "We would come to a grinding halt."

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet in person with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Iceland on May 20. The meeting represents the highest-level in-person talks between Washington and Moscow since President Joe Biden took office.	WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet in person with his Russian counterpart next week in Iceland, the highest-level in-person talks between Washington and Moscow since President Joe Biden took office. The meeting, which was announced Wednesday in separate statements from the U.S. State Department and Russian Foreign Ministry, will take place on May 20 on the sidelines of the Arctic Council ministerial meeting. Blinken, who spoke to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday, called on Moscow to release former U.S. Marines Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed , who are serving 16-year and 9-year prison sentences, respectively, according to a State Department readout of the conversation. "Secretary Blinken reiterated President Biden's resolve to protect U.S. citizens and act firmly in defense of U.S. interests in response to actions by Russia that harm us or our allies," State Department spokesman Ned Price wrote in a statement. According to a translation of the Russian Foreign Ministry statement , Blinken and Lavrov discussed "Washington's proposal to organize a Russian-American summit." Biden had proposed a summit meeting with President Vladimir Putin in an April phone call with the Russian leader. The U.S. also provided Russia with an overview of Washington's policy toward North Korea, according to the State Department. Russia's foreign ministry said they discussed the ongoing negotiations to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, nuclear deal with Iran. The United States and Russia own the lion's share of the world's nuclear weapons . The call between Blinken and Lavrov comes as the Biden administration pushes back against Russia on a number of fronts. In March, the United States sanctioned seven members of the Russian government for the alleged poisoning and subsequent detention of Alexei Navalny, the leading critic of Putin in Russia. The sanctions were the first to target Moscow under Biden's leadership. The Trump administration did not take action against Russia over the Navalny situation. In April, Washington slapped Russia with another round of U.S. sanctions for human rights abuses, sweeping cyberattacks and attempts to influence U.S. elections. The Biden administration also expelled 10 officials from Russia's diplomatic mission in the United States. Moscow has previously denied any wrongdoing and has dismissed U.S. allegations. Russia described the latest moves by the White House as a blow to bilateral relations and vowed to impose swift retaliatory measures. In response to the U.S. action, Russia expelled 10 U.S. diplomats from the American embassy in Moscow.
The Secret Service has confiscated and returned to states about $2 billion in stolen Covid unemployment relief funds, agency officials said. Programs in at least 30 states received the money after the agency determined several recipients had fraudulently applied for pandemic-related unemployment. The fast rollout of the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program made it easy prey for fraudsters.	The Secret Service has confiscated and returned to states about $2 billion in stolen Covid unemployment relief funds, agency officials said Wednesday. Programs in at least 30 states received the money after the agency determined recipients had fraudulently applied for pandemic-related unemployment. "This is typical of the cyber fraud we deal with annually. It's just compounded based on additional funds (from) Covid relief," Roy Dotson, Secret Service assistant special agent in charge, told CNBC. "The criminals did take full advantage of the programs to try to steal from them." He said the $2 billion returned to the states was a "conservative estimate" and that pandemic-related fraud investigations are ongoing. He said last year that the Secret Service sent advisories to financial institutions to flag possibly fraudulent accounts where the money may have been deposited. Dotson said fraudsters typically stole the identities of people who qualified for unemployment benefits. In other cases, he said, identities were stolen from people who hadn't even filed for unemployment. The fast rollout of the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program made it easy prey for fraudsters. The Labor Department's Office of Inspector General, in a report released in March, said that at least $89 billion of the estimated $896 billion in unemployment program funds "could be paid improperly, with a significant portion attributable to fraud." The Labor Department has said it would work with the Secret Service, the Justice Department and other agencies "to vigorously pursue those who defraud the unemployment insurance program and safeguard benefits intended for unemployed workers." The Secret Service also announced that it has seized more than $640 million in funds defrauded primarily from the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. It opened some 690 unemployment insurance investigations and 720 investigations related to those two programs. CNBC previously revealed that millions of dollars in Covid-19 funds had been laundered through online investment platforms. NBC News reported in February that most of the 50 state workforce agencies did not yet know the full extent of their losses. "I imagine this will take another year or two to sort out," Dotson said.
Israel prepared ground troops along the Gaza border on Thursday and Hamas launched rocket barrages at Israel. International calls mounted for an end to the region's fiercest hostilities in years. At least 72 people have been killed in Gaza since violence escalated on Monday. Seven people have been killed in Israel.	Israel prepared ground troops along the Gaza border on Thursday and Hamas launched rocket barrages at Israel as international calls mounted for an end to the region's fiercest hostilities in years. One rocket fired from the Palestinian enclave crashed into a building near Israel's commercial capital of Tel Aviv, injuring five Israelis, police said. Sirens blared in cities across southern Israel, sending thousands running for shelters. In renewed airstrikes on Thursday, Israel destroyed a six-story residential building in the heart of Gaza City. One man was killed by an Israeli missile fired east of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, medics said. A wave of violence between Jewish Israelis and the country's Arab minority also spread in several Israeli cities, with attacks on synagogues and Arab-Jewish fighting in the streets. At least 72 people have been killed in Gaza since violence escalated on Monday, medics said, further straining hospitals already under heavy pressure during the Covid-19 pandemic. Seven people have been killed in Israel, its military said. Israel has prepared combat troops along the Gaza border and was in "various stages of preparing ground operations," a military spokesman said, a move that would recall similar incursions during Israel-Gaza wars in 2014 and 2008-2009. "The Chief of Staff is inspecting those preparations and providing guidance," Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus said. Health authorities in Gaza said they were investigating the deaths of several people overnight who they said may have inhaled poisonous gas. Samples were being examined and they had yet to draw any final conclusions, they said. Amid fears the violence could spiral further out of control, Washington planned to send an envoy, Hady Amr, for talks with Israel and Palestinians. U.S. President Joe Biden said he hoped the fighting "will be closing down sooner than later." A British minister urged Israel and Hamas to "take a step back" from the escalation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to "continue acting to strike at the military capabilities of Hamas" and other Gaza groups. Hamas is regarded as a terrorist group by the United States and Israel. On Wednesday, Israeli forces killed a senior Hamas commander and bombed several buildings, including high-rises and a bank, which Israel said was linked to the faction's activities. Hamas signaled defiance, with its leader, Ismail Haniyeh, saying: "The confrontation with the enemy is open-ended." Israel launched its offensive after Hamas fired rockets at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in retaliation for Israeli police clashes with Palestinians near al-Aqsa mosque in East Jerusalem during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Turkey, whose hosting of Hamas leaders in Istanbul in recent years has contributed to a falling out with Israel, called on Muslim countries to show a united and clear stance over the Israel-Gaza violence. A Palestinian source said truce efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations had made no progress to end the violence. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken phoned Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and said Washington "was exerting efforts with all relevant parties to reach calm," the official Palestinian news agency WAFA said. Abbas is a Hamas rival whose authority is limited to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The fighting has also touched off strife within Israel, where some in the Arab minority mounted violent pro-Palestinian protests. Attacks by Jews on Arabs passing by in ethnically mixed areas worsened overnight. One person was in critical condition after being shot by Arabs in the Arab-Jewish town of Lod, where authorities imposed a curfew, police said. Over 150 arrests were made overnight in Lod and Arab towns in northern Israel, police said. In Gaza, two multi-story residential buildings and a tower housing media outlets, including one linked to Hamas, collapsed after Israel urged occupants to evacuate in advance of its airstrikes, and another structure was heavily damaged. Many in Israel also holed up in shelters as waves of rockets hit its heartland, some blown out of the sky by Iron Dome interceptors. The fatalities in Israel include a soldier killed while patrolling the Gaza border and at least five civilians, including two children and an Indian worker, medical authorities said. Gaza's health ministry said 17 of the people killed in the enclave were children and six were women. The Israeli military said on Thursday that some 400 of 1,600 rockets fired by Gaza factions had fallen short, potentially causing some Palestinian civilian casualties. The conflict has led to the freezing of talks by Netanyahu's opponents on forming a governing coalition to unseat him after Israel's inconclusive March 23 election. Although the latest problems in Jerusalem were the immediate trigger for hostilities, Palestinians are frustrated by setbacks to their aspirations for an independent state in recent years. These include Washington's recognition of disputed Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a U.S. plan to end the conflict that they saw as favorable to Israel and settlement building.
President Joe Biden's executive order comes as Colonial Pipeline continues to grapple with a crippling ransomware attack. The attack has led to widespread fuel shortages along the East Coast and prompted an "all-of-government response" from the Biden administration. Last year, software from the IT company SolarWinds was breached. Hackers gained access to communications and data in several government agencies.	WASHINGTON —  President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday aimed at strengthening U.S. cybersecurity defenses, a move that follows a series of sweeping cyberattacks on private companies and federal government networks over the past year. The action comes as Colonial Pipeline continues to grapple with a crippling ransomware attack , which has led to widespread fuel shortages along the East Coast and prompted an all-of-government response. The Colonial Pipeline hack is only the latest example of criminal groups or state actors exploiting U.S. cyber vulnerabilities. Last year, software from the IT company SolarWinds was breached, allowing hackers to gain access to communications and data in several government agencies. The president's executive order calls for the federal government and private sector to partner to confront "persistent and increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber campaigns" that threaten U.S. security. Biden's executive order takes a number of steps aimed at modernizing the nation's cybersecurity: News of the president's action came about an hour after Colonial announced it had restarted pipeline operations — though it will be days before fuel deliveries return to normal, the company said in a press release. "Colonial will move as much gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel as is safely possible and will continue to do so until markets return to normal," said the statement , which also thanked the Biden administration "for their leadership and collaboration." Biden Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm first shared the update in a tweet after a phone call with Colonial CEO Tim Felt. At the White House earlier Wednesday afternoon, President Joe Biden hinted his administration would soon have "good news" to share about its efforts to address the attack on Colonial. The White House said Tuesday it was directing a " comprehensive federal response " aimed at restoring and securing U.S. energy supply chains in response to the incident. On May 7, Colonial Pipeline paused its operations and notified federal agencies that it had fallen victim to a ransomware attack. The assault, carried out by the criminal cyber group known as DarkSide , forced the company to shut down approximately 5,500 miles of pipeline, leading to a disruption of nearly half of the East Coast's fuel supply. Ransomware attacks involve malware that encrypts files on a device or network that results in the system becoming inoperable. Criminals behind these types of cyberattacks typically demand a ransom in exchange for the release of data. Foreign governments have also been accused of launching cyberattacks to conduct espionage and sabotage. In April, Washington formally held Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service responsible for carrying out the SolarWinds cyberattack. Microsoft President Brad Smith described the cyberattack as " the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen ." Microsoft's systems were also infected with malicious software. The Russian government denies all allegations that it was behind the SolarWinds hack. CNBC's Kevin Breuninger reported from New York.
House Republicans on Wednesday removed Rep. Liz Cheney from her party leadership role after she urged the GOP to reject former President Donald Trump. Cheney has bashed Trump for spreading the lie that the 2020 election was rigged against him. "I will do everything I can to ensure that the former president never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office," Cheney said.	House Republicans on Wednesday removed Rep. Liz Cheney from her party leadership role after she urged the GOP to reject former President Donald Trump. But Cheney remained defiant, vowing to continue the fight against Trump. "I will do everything I can to ensure that the former president never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office," Cheney told reporters after she was ousted as House GOP conference chair during a closed-door meeting. "The party is in a place that we've got to bring it back from," she said. "We cannot be dragged backward by the very dangerous lies of a former president." Cheney delivered one final pitch to her colleagues at the top of the meeting, which began around 9 a.m. ET and lasted roughly 20 minutes. "We cannot let the former president drag us backward and make us complicit in his efforts to unravel our democracy," Cheney said, NBC News reported. "Down that path lies our destruction, and potentially the destruction of our country." "If you want leaders who will enable and spread his destructive lies, I'm not your person, you have plenty of others to choose from. That will be their legacy," she said. "But I promise you this, after today, I will be leading the fight to restore our party and our nation to conservative principles, to defeating socialism, to defending our republic, to making the GOP worthy again of being the party of Lincoln," Cheney said. In a statement following the GOP conference's voice vote, Trump applauded Cheney's removal with a chain of personal insults against the Wyoming lawmaker. The showdown came days after two other top-ranking House Republicans, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise, said they were through with Cheney as House GOP conference chair. They and Trump have endorsed Rep. Elise Stefanik, a fourth-term New York congresswoman who gained national attention in 2019 for forcefully defending Trump during his first impeachment trial. A vote for the new conference chair will be held Friday, McCarthy said at the end of Wednesday's meeting, NBC reported. The push to swap the staunchly conservative and politically deep-rooted Cheney with the Trump-supporting Stefanik offers a stark example of the GOP's shift toward a firm realignment behind the former president with the 2022 midterm congressional elections coming up. Cheney, one of just 10 Republicans to vote to impeach Trump on the charge of inciting the deadly Jan. 6 invasion of the U.S. Capitol, survived a prior attempt in February to oust her . At that time, the Wyoming Republican had the backing of her fellow House leaders. To their chagrin, Cheney in the three months since has continued to bash Trump for spreading the lie that the 2020 election was rigged against him. In doing so, Cheney, who was the No. 3 Republican in the House, set herself apart from nearly the rest of her conference, which in the wake of Trump's loss has grown only more committed to preserving the ex-president's status as its leader. Trump never conceded the 2020 election to President Joe Biden and still falsely claims he won the race — though his reach was limited after multiple social media companies banned him from their platforms in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud. William Barr, Trump's attorney general at the time, said the Department of Justice found no evidence of fraud that would reverse Biden's victory. But public opinion polling suggests large swaths of Trump's supporters still believe illegal voting or fraud changed the outcome of the race. Some Republicans, including McCarthy and Scalise, have suggested Cheney's refusal to back down on Trump creates a distraction that hurts the GOP's goal of winning back the House in 2022. "Each day spent relitigating the past is one day less we have to seize the future," McCarthy said Tuesday in a letter that did not mention Cheney by name. But Cheney, in a searing speech on the House floor Tuesday night and in an  op-ed last week , argued that confronting Trump's election lies is practically a patriotic duty. Cheney has vowed to keep up the fight against Trump's "Big Lie" even if she is booted from leadership . On the eve of the expected vote to oust her, Cheney appeared to get a head start, taking to the floor of the House to make her case. "Today we face a threat America has never seen before: A former president who provoked a violent attack on this Capitol, in an effort to steal the election, has resumed his aggressive effort to convince Americans that the election was stolen from him," Cheney said. Trump "risks inciting further violence," she said, and he "continues to undermine our democratic process, sowing seeds of doubt about whether democracy really works at all." She noted that after dozens of court challenges and official investigations, no widespread election fraud was discovered. "The election is over," Cheney said. "Those who refuse to accept the rulings of our courts are at war with the Constitution." "Our duty is clear: Every one of us who has sworn the oath must act to prevent the unraveling of our democracy," she said. "This is not about policy, this is not about partisanship. This is about our duty as Americans." "Remaining silent and ignoring the lie emboldens the liar." "I will not participate in that," Cheney added. "I will not sit back and watch in silence while others lead our party down a path that abandons the rule of law and joins the former president's crusade to undermine our democracy." After the 2020 election cycle, Republicans lost control of the White House and the Senate. But much of the party still sees Trump as its biggest draw. "He's the most popular Republican in the country by a lot. If you try to drive him out of the Republican Party, half the people will leave," Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a committed Trump ally, said Tuesday on Fox News. "So it doesn't mean you can't criticize the president, it means the Republican Party cannot go forward without President Trump being part of it," Graham said. While Cheney was ousted behind closed doors, the intraparty row over her views has been aired in broad daylight — leading to some unusual political optics, such as Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praising Cheney for speaking "truth to power." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in a statement Wednesday called Cheney "a leader of great courage, patriotism and integrity." "Today, House Republicans declared that those values are unwelcome in the Republican party," Pelosi said. The Biden administration has largely steered clear of the fight. "We will leave that to them to work out among themselves," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday when asked about the GOP power struggle. But asked about it directly last week, Biden said the GOP looks like it's going through a "sort of mini-revolution." "We badly need a Republican Party. We need a two-party system. It's not healthy to have a one-party system," Biden said at the White House. "And I think the Republicans are further away from trying to figure out who they are and what they stand for than I thought they would be at this point." McCarthy and other Republicans are scheduled to visit the White House later this week to discuss the administration's economic investment plans.
President Joe Biden hosted the Democratic and Republican leaders from both houses of Congress on Wednesday at the White House, the first such meeting of his presidency. Topping the agenda was Biden's infrastructure-focused American Jobs Plan. Following the meeting, Republicans said the two sides had not yet agreed on the definition of "infrastructure," and they doubled down on their refusal to revisit the 2017 GOP tax cuts to pay for improvements.	WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden hosted the Democratic and Republican leaders from both houses of Congress on Wednesday at the White House, where they discussed the president's infrastructure plan for nearly two hours but made little headway on a consensus. This was the first time in his presidency that Biden had met in person with the so-called Big 4: Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, and Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California. Vice President Kamala Harris also attended the meeting, which took place in the Oval Office. "We're going to talk a lot about infrastructure today. And see if there's any way we can reach a compromise that gets the people's work done and is within the bounds of everyone agreeing," Biden said at the outset. Following the meeting, McCarthy and McConnell spoke briefly to reporters. McConnell said that nearly all of the conversation with the president revolved around infrastructure, and that there is "a bipartisan desire to get an outcome" on it. But he added that the two sides still needed to "define what infrastructure is," suggesting that they had not made significant progress on the most basic elements of a negotiation. A White House readout of the meeting said the attendees had "agreed there was a need for investment" in infrastructure, but did not cite any other progress. Pelosi sounded the most optimistic of the attendees, saying after the meeting that she felt "more optimistic now that we will do [infrastructure] in a bipartisan way. But we'll see." The first piece of Biden's two-part domestic policy agenda is the $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan , which is aimed at a broad array of infrastructure spending that spans both traditional projects like roads and more progressive efforts like expanded broadband. Republicans have objected to Biden's plan to classify projects like expanded broadband and electric vehicle charging stations as "infrastructure." McConnell also reiterated the GOP's firm red line on raising the corporate tax rate, which was slashed in 2017 under then-President Donald Trump, in order to fund any of Biden's proposals. "We're not interested in reopening the 2017 tax bill. We both made that clear with the president. That's our red line," McConnell said. "This discussion ... will not include revisiting the 2017 tax bill." The second part of Biden's agenda is the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan , which proposes funding for four additional years of free universal education, subsidizing child care for middle-class families, and expanding paid family leave and child tax credits. During his presidential campaign, Biden promised to reach across the aisle and find areas of consensus between the two parties, something he said would help to repair the deeply divided nation. Yet Republicans say the only way Biden could hope to win bipartisan support for any part of his legislative agenda is by whittling down his infrastructure plan to less than half of its current size, and funding it not with tax hikes on corporations, as Biden proposes, but with user fees on drivers and transit riders. As for the family and child-care plan, few, if any potential areas of compromise have emerged so far. Biden also found himself seeking common ground with a fractured Republican Party, further complicating the political calculus. Wednesday's meeting took place just hours after House Republicans expelled Rep. Liz Cheney, Wyo., from her position as GOP conference chair over her refusal to embrace Trump's lie that the 2020 election was rigged. On Thursday, Biden is scheduled to meet with six Republicans senators who serve as the ranking members of committees with jurisdiction over infrastructure: Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, John Barrasso of Wyoming, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Pennsylvania's Pat Toomey and Roger Wicker, Mississippi's senior senator. This meeting has the potential to yield more concrete areas of agreement than Wednesday's leadership meeting did.
The Biden administration is repealing a Trump-era regulation that made it harder for the EPA to issue strict standards on air pollution. The so-called Benefit-Cost Rule, adopted weeks before former President Donald Trump exited office, changed the way the agency assessed the cost and benefits of regulations on pollution. The move is the latest push by the administration to combat climate change and undo more than 100 Trump-era environmental regulations that favored fossil fuels.	The Biden administration moved Thursday to repeal a Trump-era regulation that made it harder for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to issue strict standards and public health protections on air pollution. The so-called Benefit-Cost Rule , which was adopted weeks before former President Donald Trump exited office, changed the way the agency assessed the cost and benefits of regulations on pollution. The EPA said the previous rule imposed restrictions on cost-benefit analyses for Clean Air Act rulemaking without explaining why those requirements were necessary. The agency also said the restrictions by Trump would have limited the EPA's "ability to use the best available science in developing Clean Air Act regulations," a move it argued would be "inconsistent with economic best practices." "EPA has critical authority under the Clean Air Act to protect the public from harmful air pollution, among other threats to our health," the agency's administrator, Michael Regan, said in a statement. "Revoking this unnecessary and misguided rule is proof positive of this administration's commitment to science." The move is the latest push by the Biden administration to aggressively combat climate change and undo more than 100 Trump-era environmental regulations that favored the fossil fuel industry. Trump EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler had argued that that administration's costs and benefits rule allowed the agency to conduct its work in a "transparent fashion." The administration's move was largely supported by the fossil fuel sector, which is directly affected by federal pollution regulations. But environmental groups argued that the Trump administration's change was designed to weaken climate protections and further support rollbacks on rules governing planet-warming emissions from power plants, automobiles and other sources. The agency said the interim final rule will become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register and will be followed by a final rule that responds to public comments. "We will continue to fix the wrongs of the past and move forward aggressively to deliver on President Biden's clear commitment to protecting public health and the environment," Regan said. In his first days in office, Biden signed a series of executive orders, from directing the EPA to review all regulations and policies by the Trump administration to halting new oil and gas leases on federal land and waters and bringing the U.S. back into the Paris climate accord. The president recently pledged to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030 — more than doubling the country's prior commitment. Biden also proposed a sweeping infrastructure package with a major focus on climate mitigation , prompting pushback from congressional Republicans.
The trial for former Minneapolis police officers Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao has been delayed until March. The trial had been scheduled for August. Former cop Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter in George Floyd's death.	The trial of three former Minneapolis police officers who who assisted Derek Chauvin in the attempted arrest of George Floyd last May has been delayed until next year. Judge Peter Cahill said during a hearing Thursday that the trial for the three former officers, Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, would begin in March, according to a pool reporter present in the courtroom. The trial had been scheduled for August. Lane, Kueng and Thao were captured on video assisting Chauvin while the veteran police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck and back during the arrest, which led to Floyd's death. Chauvin, who is white, continued for about nine minutes while Floyd, a Black man, cried out for a chunk of that time that he could not breathe. Floyd, who was apprehended on suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill, died while in custody, and the footage of his killing sparked months of protests against racism in policing. Cahill cited the likely publicity around Chauvin's sentencing on June 25 as a reason for the delay. The judge also cited new federal charges against Chauvin and the three officers, which could carry steeper penalties than the state charges. It was revealed earlier this month that a federal grand jury charged all four former officers with violating Floyd's civil rights. Chauvin was found guilty last month of Floyd's murder and is facing a potential sentence of more than a decade in prison. On Wednesday, Cahill ruled that Chauvin abused his authority as a police officer and treated Floyd with particular cruelty, aggravating factors that could increase the length of his sentence considerably. Chauvin was convicted of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The other three officers have been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The newly revealed federal indictment accused Thao and Kueng of failing to intervene while Chauvin used unreasonable force that led to Floyd's death. All four former officers were accused in the indictment of failing to provide Floyd with aid while he was "in clear need of medical care." Attorneys for the three former officers agreed to the delay in the trial, The Associated Press reported. Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank, a prosecutor in the case, opposed the move.
An active-duty U.S. Marine officer has been arrested and charged with participating in the invasion of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 by a mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump. The 40-year-old officer, Major Christopher Warnagiris, is accused of pushing his way past a line of police protecting the Capitol and forcing his way through a doorway in the East Rotunda of the Capitol. Warnagiris, of Woodbridge, Virginia, is charged in federal court with assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers. He will make his initial court appearance Thursday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.	An active-duty U.S. Marine officer was arrested in Virginia on Thursday and charged with using violence against police during the Jan. 6 invasion of the U.S. Capitol b y a mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump . Major Christopher Warnagiris, who is the first active-duty member of the U.S. armed forces to be charged in connection with the riot, is accused of pushing his way past a line of police protecting the Capitol and forcing his way through a doorway in the East Rotunda of the Capitol. Warnagiris, a 40-year-old Woodbridge, Virginia resident, is charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers, obstruction of law enforcement, obstruction of Congress, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol Grounds, and entering or remaining in a restricted building without lawful authority. Warnagiris, whose 18-year tenure in the Marines includes deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, faces a maximum possible sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted of the charges, which will be prosecuted in federal court in Washington. Warnagiris currently is assigned to the training and education command of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force Staff Training Program at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, according to Marines. A judge ordered Warnagiris released when he appeared Thursday afternoon in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In addition to Warnagiris, the more than 400 defendants in pending Capitol riot prosecutions include at least four other current service members: two Army Reserve soldiers and two members of the National Guard in different states . More than three dozen military veterans also have been arrested in such cases. Court documents say that after Warnagiris violently entered the Capitol he positioned himself in the corner of the doorway and used his body to prop the door open and pull other rioters inside. Video surveillance footage shows Warnagiris pushing a cop who tried to shut the door, according to a criminal complaint. The Marine Corps, in a statement confirming that Warnagiris is on active duty, said, "The Marine Corps is clear on this: There is no place for racial hatred or extremism in the Marine Corps. Our strength is derived from the individual excellence of every Marine regardless of background. Bigotry and racial extremism run contrary to our core values." "Participation with hate or extremist groups of any kind is directly contradictory to the core values of honor, courage, and commitment that we stand for as Marines and isn't tolerated by the Marine Corps," the statement said. "We expect every Marine to treat their fellow Marines with dignity and respect. Those who can't value the contributions of others, regardless of background, are destructive to our culture, our warfighting ability, and have no place in our ranks." Warnagiris was identified by a member of the public on March 16 after that person saw three photos of a man who had entered the Capitol, according to the complaint. That witness recognized Warnagiris after having worked with him for about six months in 2019, the complaint said. A second witness "who has worked with Warnagiris for approximately nine months and tends to see him in close proximity several times a week" identified him in the same photos seen by the first witness, according to that charging document. In 2017, Warnagiris acted as operations officer for a landing force of U.S. Marines and Navy sailors who were placed on the French Navy amphibious assault ship LHD Tonnere during a two-month deployment in the U.S. 5th fleet area of operations, according to a news article on the Marines website. His service awards include the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Unit Commendation Medal and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal. About 440 people have been arrested on charges related to the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, which began after Trump urged a throng of supporters at a rally outside the White House to march there. The invasion of the Capitol complex disrupted a joint session of Congress, which was sitting that day to confirm the Electoral College victory of President Joe Biden . Trump had falsely claimed for weeks after the November presidential election, and has continued to do so since, that he won the White House race and that Biden's victory was the result of widespread ballot fraud.
Former Florida elected official Joel Greenberg has agreed to plead guilty in a criminal case that sparked the sex trafficking investigation of his friend Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, court records show. Greenberg is scheduled to appear Monday in Orlando federal court for a change of plea hearing, according to the records. Gaetz, a staunch supporter of former President Trump, has denied any wrongdoing.	Joel Greenberg, a friend of Rep. Matt Gaetz, has agreed to plead guilty in a criminal case connected to the federal sex-trafficking investigation of the Republican lawmaker and Trump ally , court records show. Greenberg is scheduled to appear Monday morning in federal court in Orlando, Florida, for a change of plea hearing, the records state. Greenberg, a county tax collector in Florida, faces charges including sex trafficking of a minor, stalking, wire fraud and identity theft. He pleaded not guilty to those charges, but his lawyer and prosecutors told a judge at a hearing last month that Greenberg was expected to strike a plea deal. Greenberg's lawyer Fritz Scheller told reporters after that hearing, "I'm sure Matt Gaetz isn't feeling very comfortable today." Scheller later said, "You've seen the number of stories out there and the emphasis is on their relationship. Isn't it obvious to assume that he would be concerned?" Gaetz, who represents Florida 's First Congressional District in the panhandle, has denied any wrongdoing and has not been criminally charged. Harlan Hill, a spokesman for Gaetz, said in a statement, "The first indictment of Joel Greenberg alleges that he falsely accused another man of sex with a minor for his own gain. That man was apparently innocent. So is Congressman Gaetz." Hill's statement referred to the fact that Greenberg is charged, among other things, with causing letters to be sent to a school where a man worked which accused that other man falsely of having engaged in sexual misconduct with a student there. Gaetz is a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump , who was in office when the Justice Department opened its investigation of the GOP lawmaker. Last month, Gaetz hired criminal defense lawyer Marc Mukasey to represent him in the investigation. Mukasey also represents the Trump Organization in a criminal probe being conducted by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.
President Joe Biden cautioned Americans against the temptation to start "panic buying" fuel amid the ransomware cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline. Biden also warned fuel providers in the affected states not to "take advantage of consumers." Colonial restarted operations Wednesday afternoon but said the delivery schedule won't return to normal for several days.	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Thursday cautioned Americans against the temptation to start "panic buying" fuel in the wake of a ransomware cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline, which has crippled gas delivery systems in Southeastern states. Biden also warned fuel providers in the affected states not to gouge customers. "Don't panic," Biden said in a speech at the White House. "I know seeing lines at the pumps or gas stations with no gas can be extremely stressful. But this is a temporary situation." "Do not get more gas than you need the next few days," the president said. "Gasoline supply is coming back online, and panic buying will only slow the process." Biden then admonished gas stations: "Do not try to take advantage of consumers during this time." He vowed to work with governors to help stop price gouging wherever it arises. "Nobody should be using this situation for financial gain," the president said. Colonial restarted operations Wednesday afternoon but said the delivery schedule won't return to normal for several days. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted Thursday morning that Colonial Pipeline's restart "went well overnight," and "this should mean things will return to normal by the end of the weekend." But gas analyst Patrick De Haan predicted that mid-Atlantic states could continue to see shortages at the gas pump for the next week, while supply catches up with demand. Biden's remarks come a day after the president signed an executive order mandating significant changes to government cybersecurity standards, aimed at strengthening the nation's cyber defenses in critical sectors of the economy. The president's order creates more stringent reporting requirements for companies that are targeted by cyberattacks, like Colonial Pipeline, especially if the company interacts with government IT systems. The order also calls on the federal government and private sector to work together to combat "persistent and increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber campaigns." The latest moves by the Biden administration represent what the White House says is a large-scale government mobilization to respond to the crisis, which began when Colonial Pipeline informed federal agencies Friday that it had been the target of a ransomware attack. The assault forced the company to shut down approximately 5,500 miles of pipeline, leading to a disruption of nearly half of the nation's East Coast fuel supply. The attack on Colonial Pipeline has been traced to a hacker group called the DarkSide, an organized group of hackers set up along the "ransomware as a service" business model. This means the DarkSide hackers develop and market ransomware hacking tools and sell them to other criminals, who then carry out attacks. DarkSide is believed to operate out of Russia, but the White House has said it has no evidence so far that the attack was state-sponsored or directed by the Kremlin. — CNBC's Pippa Stevens contributed to this report. CNBC's Kevin Breuninger reported from New York City.
Colonial Pipeline paid a ransom to hackers after the company fell victim to a sweeping cyberattack, one source familiar with the situation confirmed to CNBC. A U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed to NBC News that Colonial paid nearly $5 million as a ransom to the cybercriminals. It was not immediately clear when the transaction took place.	WASHINGTON – Colonial Pipeline paid a ransom to hackers after the company fell victim to a sweeping cyberattack, one source familiar with the situation confirmed to CNBC. A U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed to NBC News that Colonial paid nearly $5 million as a ransom to the cybercriminals. It was not immediately clear when the transaction took place. Colonial Pipeline did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. The ransom payment was first reported by Bloomberg . Earlier on Thursday, President Joe Biden declined to comment when asked if Colonial Pipeline paid the ransom. White House press secretary Jen Pskai told reporters during a briefing that it remains the position of the federal government to not pay ransoms as it may incentivize cybercriminals to launch more attacks. Last week's assault, carried out by a criminal cybergroup known as DarkSide , forced the company to shut down approximately 5,500 miles of pipeline, leading to a disruption of nearly half of the East Coast fuel supply and causing gasoline shortages in the Southeast. Ransomware attacks involve malware that encrypts files on a device or network that results in the system becoming inoperable. Criminals behind these types of cyberattacks typically demand a ransom in exchange for the release of data. On Monday, White House national security officials described the assault as financially motivated in nature but would not say if Colonial Pipeline agreed to pay the ransom. "Typically that's a private sector decision," Anne Neuberger, deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technologies, told reporters at the White House when asked about the ransom payment. "We recognize that victims of cyberattacks often face a very difficult situation and they have to just balance often the cost-benefit when they have no choice with regards to paying a ransom. Colonial is a private company and we'll defer information regarding their decision on paying a ransom to them," Neuberger said. She added that the FBI has previously warned victims of ransomware attacks that paying a ransom could encourage further malicious activity. Earlier on Monday, the DarkSide group described its actions as "apolitical" in a statement provided to CNBC by Cybereason . "We are apolitical, we do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a defined government and look for our motives," the group wrote. "Our goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society. From today we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future," the statement added. Biden told reporters on Monday that the U.S. did not currently have intelligence linking the DarkSide group's ransomware attack to the Russian government. "So far there is no evidence from our intelligence people that Russia is involved although there is evidence that the actor's ransomware is in Russia, they have some responsibility to deal with this," Biden said from the White House on Monday. He added that he would still discuss the situation with Russian President Vladimir Putin . The Kremlin has previously denied claims that it has launched cyberattacks against the United States. On Wednesday, Colonial Pipeline said in an evening statement that it had restored its operations days after it was forced to shut down its entire system due to the cyberattack. The company described its decision to temporarily close pipeline service as a precautionary measure. "Some markets served by Colonial Pipeline may experience, or continue to experience, intermittent service interruptions during the start-up period. Colonial will move as much gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel as is safely possible and will continue to do so until markets return to normal," the company added. The Colonial Pipeline hack is only the latest example of criminal groups or state actors exploiting U.S. cyber vulnerabilities. Last year, software from the IT company SolarWinds was breached, allowing hackers to gain access to communications and data in several government agencies. In April, Washington formally held Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service responsible for carrying out the SolarWinds cyberattack. Microsoft President Brad Smith described the incident as " the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen ." Microsoft's systems were also infected with malicious software. The Russian government denies all allegations that it was behind the SolarWinds hack.
President Joe Biden met with a group of senior Republican senators to discuss the prospects of a bipartisan infrastructure bill. "I am very optimistic that we can reach a reasonable agreement," Biden said after the meeting, which he called "very, very good." GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said afterwards that she was "very encouraged" by the progress made.	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said he had a "very, very good meeting" with a group of senior Republican senators Thursday about a bipartisan infrastructure deal, and that he plans to host them at the White House again next week for further talks. The lead Republican senator working on a deal with Biden, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, also said they made genuine progress. The senators attending the Oval Office meeting all serve as ranking members on committees with jurisdiction over infrastructure. In addition to Moore Capito, the meeting included Sens. John Barrasso of Wyoming, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Pennsylvania's Pat Toomey and Roger Wicker, Mississippi's senior senator. "It was great to be back with so many of the colleagues who I served with in the Senate, and I am very optimistic that we can reach a reasonable agreement," Biden said at a Rose Garden event following the meeting. "We didn't compromise on anything, what we did was, I laid out what I thought we should be doing, and how it should be paid for, and my colleagues in the Senate came back to me and said they'll come back with a counteroffer of what they are prepared to do, and how to fund it, and then we'll talk again next week," said Biden. There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic that Biden, a consummate dealmaker, can reach an agreement with Republicans on some infrastructure proposals, especially if he agrees to split the massive $1.8 trillion American Jobs Plan package into two or more separate bills. Following the meeting, Moore Capito also said the two sides had made genuine progress. She said Biden had asked the Republicans to rework an earlier counteroffer they made to his American Jobs Plan, and bring it back to him so he could make his own counteroffer. "We had a very productive [meeting], more than courteous give and take," she said. "We did talk specifics, and the president has asked us to come back and rework an offer so that he can then react to that and then reoffer to us. We're very encouraged, we feel very committed to the bipartisanship that we think this infrastructure package can carry forward." Blunt said it was "a really positive meeting... I think we'll be able to go back the first of the week with another offer, and I believe he will make a counteroffer to that. And we all know we need to move pretty quickly here." In a statement, Toomey that he believes, "Congress and the Biden administration can come together and enact a bipartisan bill that responsibly boosts federal support for our roads, bridges, ports, and airports." But there remain major disagreements over core elements of an infrastructure bill, including what "infrastructure" should mean. Biden's proposal features hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for traditional infrastructure projects, such as roads and bridge repair. It also includes billions more in spending to expand the electrical grid, bolster care for elderly and disabled Americans, invest in affordable housing and expand broadband access. Republicans have seized on Biden's expansive definition of "infrastructure" to oppose much of his proposal. Moore Capito said the senators and the president acknowledged where they had differences, but didn't dwell on them. "I'm not saying [Biden] agrees with it or with everything. That's the point of a negotiation here. He understands why we knocked some things out. If he wants to try to have us reconsider, that's part of a negotiation. I think he got our point. He understands what we think modern infrastructure is, including broadband, and how big that package could be." Democrats and Republicans also remain far apart on how to pay for the much-needed infrastructure investments. Democrats have so far rejected a Republican proposal to fund the plan through user fees, with White House officials saying this amounts to a tax hike on middle-class Americans who drive. Instead, Democrats propose raising the corporate tax rate and closing loopholes that would effectively mean corporations and the very richest Americans pay for the plan. Republicans say any changes to the low tax rates enacted in their 2017 tax-cut bill are a nonstarter. Moore Capito said the senators did not discuss specifics on how to pay for the improvements with Biden. The president has set an unofficial deadline of Memorial Day for reaching a deal with Republicans, or at least making significant progress on a deal. Thursday's meeting was the most positive step so far towards achieving Biden's goal of crafting a bipartisan infrastructure package. "The attitude that the president had in the Oval Office with us was very supportive, very much desirous of striking a deal. And I think we were all reflective of that, as well," said Moore Capito. If Biden fails to reach a bipartisan compromise on the plan, he and congressional Democrats have said they will use budget reconciliation to pass an infrastructure package on a purely party-line vote, which requires only 51 votes in the Senate.
Protecting the American people and companies against ransomware must be one of our top priorities as a nation. That is why the Departments of Homeland Security and Commerce are working together to help businesses both prevent and respond to ransomware attacks.	The recent ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline was an all too familiar story to businesses across the United States. The pipeline, which supplies fuel to some 50 million people from the Gulf Coast up through the entire East Coast, was closed last Friday as a precautionary measure after a ransomware attack. The company and the U.S. government continue to investigate the extent of the impact. Over the past few months, ransomware attacks have not only hit businesses of all sizes, but also hospitals in New York, Nebraska, Oregon, and Michigan, among multiple other states. Police and sheriffs' offices, schools, and local governments, from Atlanta to Baltimore to Fisher County, Texas, have suffered a similar fate. A recent report from the Ransomware Task Force, a group of 60 cybersecurity experts from industry and government, sheds light on both the alarming increase in the frequency of these attacks and the ransom size they demanded. In 2020, it estimates $350 million in ransom was paid to attackers – a more than 300 percent increase over the previous year – with an average payment of over $300,000. According to a 2021 report, the greatest number of victims in 2020 by industry were in manufacturing, professional and legal services, and construction. Healthcare, manufacturing, and education businesses experienced significant increases. Attacks against industry sectors, including aerospace, also appear to be on the rise. Often, organizations hit by ransomware face a very difficult choice: either pay a ransom and fuel a criminal market or refuse to pay and hope their computer systems can be restored. If businesses decide to pay the ransom to quickly resume operations, the price can put their business on the brink of bankruptcy. Moreover, there is no guarantee their systems will be restored. Businesses may also lose access to their proprietary information, including intellectual property and client and employee data, in addition to suffering reputational costs. Protecting the American people and companies against ransomware must be one of our top priorities as a nation. We can no longer look the other way and we cannot treat ransomware as simply a nuisance. This latest attack should serve as a clarion call for organizations across the country to shore up their cyber defenses and get ahead of future threats. Ransomware – like most cyber-attacks – exploits the weakest link. Small businesses are particularly vulnerable because many of them are financially fragile and do not have the necessary resources to install cybersecurity software, ensure constant technology monitoring, provide employee training, and hire full-time information technology experts. It's no surprise that small businesses comprise half to three-quarters of all ransomware victims. And when these businesses do become targets, it can have devastating and permanent impacts, forcing some to close their doors permanently. In short, organizations in every sector and of every size need to take this threat seriously and take steps today to protect themselves. By the time you're dealing with an attack, it's too late for proactive measures. The good news is that you don't have to do it alone and there are affordable solutions for every budget. That is why the Departments of Homeland Security and Commerce are working together to help businesses both prevent and respond to ransomware attacks. A few simple but critical steps can go a long way to protect against this category of malicious cyber activity, and our two departments are committed to working together with businesses and their CEOs. The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is well-positioned to help organizations take preventive measures to increase resilience before an attack occurs. CISA recently launched its " Reduce the Risk of Ransomware Campaign " with free, public guidance and resources to help organizations prepare for these attacks and evaluate the strength of their company's cyber posture. CISA's website also points to the practical guidance offered by Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), leveraging its deep economic and technical expertise. The National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force has also provided a guide on how to respond after a ransomware attack has occurred. Increasing basic cybersecurity hygiene to prevent ransomware is important, but it's only part of the solution. The Biden-Harris Administration is coordinating a whole-of-government strategy to increase resilience, disrupt, and investigate ransomware networks, and hold perpetrators accountable. However, the federal government cannot combat ransomware alone. Prevention, disruption, and prosecution require collaboration across every level of government and the private sector – both domestically and internationally. Our Departments will continue to advocate for a comprehensive approach to tackling ransomware to keep our communities safe. The demands of meeting pernicious ransomware attacks require nothing less. In the coming weeks, we will increase our Departments' respective collaboration with the private sector and explore new initiatives designed to support businesses, healthcare systems, and local governments. These public-private partnerships will continue to protect our businesses, our economy, and our national security. Alejandro N. Mayorkas is the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security and Gina M. Raimondo is the U.S. Secretary of Commerce.
Andy Slavitt, a senior advisor on President Joe Biden's coronavirus response team, confirmed Friday he will be leaving his role in early June. Slavitt, whose position on Biden's Covid response team was temporary, said that while the administration had achieved many of its goals for the pandemic, more work remains to be done. Slavitt discussed his forthcoming departure a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks in most situations.	Andy Slavitt, a senior advisor on President Joe Biden's coronavirus response team, confirmed Friday he will be leaving his role in early June. Slavitt, whose temporary position on Biden's Covid panel was known to be expiring next month, said that while the administration had achieved many of its goals for the pandemic, more work remains to be done. "Look, there's never a perfect time to leave," Slavitt said in a Bloomberg interview. But he said he believes that when he does depart, "things are in really great hands with the people here, that many difficult things have been accomplished." "There's much more work to do, but the people here, I couldn't think of a better set of people to do it than the people that will be here when I'm gone," he said. Asked what else needs to be done, Slavitt mentioned the "big job" of persuading the remaining bloc of unvaccinated Americans to get their shots, as well as helping other struggling nations' vaccination efforts. "There will always be things to do, there will always be challenges," Slavitt said. "Hopefully they will not be as intense for the country's sake as they've been so far." Slavitt said he will be leaving sometime in "the beginning of June." The White House did not respond to CNBC's request for comment for more details. Slavitt was a so-called special government employee, a status that limits his service to 130 days, according to the Department of the Interior . Slavitt discussed his plans a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks in most situations . The shift in guidance marked a significant relaxation of social distancing recommendations that had been in effect in one form or another throughout most of the pandemic. Biden and other administration officials celebrated the update, which coincided with the U.S. hitting 250 million vaccinations, as a turning point in the United States' fight against the virus.
President Biden called for a de-escalation of violence and a reduction in rocket attacks in the Middle East amid intensifying conflict between Israel and Palestinians. The president told reporters he expects to have conversations with leaders in the region. Israeli forces have been bombing and sending troops and tanks to the Gaza border after Palestinian militants fired more rockets into Israel.	Deadly violence between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza intensified Friday, as President Joe Biden called for a de-escalation in the worst fighting since 2014. "Palestinians — including in Gaza — and Israelis equally deserve to live in dignity, safety and security. No family should have to fear for their safety within their own home or place of worship," the president said in a statement on Friday marking the Eid holiday and the end of Ramadan. Israeli forces have been bombing and sending troops and tanks to the Gaza border after militants fired more rockets into Israeli cities. At least 119 people have been killed, including 31 children, according to officials in Gaza. Eight people have been killed in Israel, including a soldier and some civilians, amid airstrikes and rocket attacks between the Israeli military and militant group Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip. It was the most severe outbreak of violence between Israel and the Palestinians since the 2014 war in Gaza. "We think most about the children in these societies who face trauma from a conflict far beyond their control," Biden said. The president added that he will continue to engage Palestinians, Israelis and other regional partners to address the situation. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki at a briefing on Friday said the administration is working toward de-escalating the conflict. "We're watching this closely, we will remain closely engaged," she said. "A lot of the conversations we have may be behind the scenes." "Israel has the right to self defense," Psaki continued. "Our focus remains on using every lever at our disposal to de-escalate the situation on the ground." She added that U.S. humanitarian assistance to Palestinians will continue. The dramatic escalation followed protests over the potential eviction of Palestinian families from a neighborhood in east Jerusalem by Israel's Supreme Court. In Jerusalem last Friday, Israeli security forces clashed with stone-throwing Palestinians near Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site in advance of a Monday court hearing in the eviction case. With tensions rising, the high court delayed the hearing in the case brought by right-wing Israelis. Monday also was the anniversary of Israel's recapture of east Jerusalem in the 1967 war and the Muslim observance of Ramadan. Israel said it is deploying troops to the Gaza frontier ahead of a possible ground invasion of the territory following four days of continued cross-border conflict. In addition to the Hamas rocket attacks on Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other cities and Israeli retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza, Jewish and Arab mobs have clashed in the streets of several Israeli towns this week, leading to dozens of arrests. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned in a televised speech that the escalating conflict has put Israel in two fighting campaigns — in Gaza and in Israel's cities —and reiterated his promise to deploy forces to combat violence in the cities. "I again call on the citizens of Israel not to take the law into their own hands; whoever does so will be punished severely," Netanyahu said. "We will act with full force against enemies from without and lawbreakers from within in order to restore calm to the state of Israel." Netanyahu on Friday also gave thanks to Biden and other world leaders and vowed that Israel will "continue to act" against Hamas. "It's not over yet," he said. "We will do everything to restore security to our city and our citizens." A ground invasion of Gaza has not yet been announced. Some world leaders and lawmakers have condemned the violence and urged a de-escalation to avoid a spiral into all-out war. Israel President Reuven Rivlin urged against a "senseless civil war" amid unrest in towns and cities. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an "immediate de-escalation and cessation of hostilities" in the region. "Too many innocent civilians have already died," Guterres wrote in a tweet. "This conflict can only increase radicalization and extremism in the whole region." Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., the chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee, urged a ceasefire as quickly as possible to prevent more civilian deaths. "Ground operations will not stop the rockets falling on Israel, or solve the fundamental security challenges that Israel faces," Murphy said in a statement Thursday. "Only a ceasefire in the short-term, and a real path to a viable two-state future in the long-term can do that." Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed Wednesday that the U.S. is sending the deputy assistant secretary of state for Israel and Palestinian affairs, to urge Israelis and Palestinians to de-escalate the violence. The U.S. State Department on Thursday also raised its travel advisory to Israel, citing armed conflict and civil unrest, and told people not to travel to Gaza due to Covid-19 and conflict. — Reuters and Associated Press contributed reporting
Two key House members, Reps. Bennie Thompson and John Katko, announced a deal on an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. The chamber is expected to vote on a bill setting up the panel as soon as next week. The commission will have 10 members, five each appointed by Democrats and Republicans, and issue a report after it finishes the probe. Democrats and some Republicans have pushed to set up a panel to better understand what led to the insurrection, as many in the GOP have tried to minimize the attack.	Key House members announced a deal Friday to form an independent commission to probe the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, as lawmakers try to understand the failings that allowed a pro-Trump mob to overrun the building. The panel will investigate the circumstances of the attack as well as the factors that led to it, according to Homeland Security Committee Chair Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and ranking member John Katko, R-N.Y., who negotiated the deal. The commission will consist of 10 members who cannot be current government officials. The majority Democrats will appoint five, including the chair, and Republicans will choose five, including the vice chair. The group will have subpoena power and issue a report when it finishes the probe. The House is expected to vote on a bill setting up the commission as soon as next week. "Inaction – or just moving on – is simply not an option," Thompson said in a statement. "The creation of this commission is our way of taking responsibility for protecting the U.S. Capitol." In a separate statement, Katko said, "I believe we have a fair, solid bill that will deliver answers on the federal response and preparedness to ensure nothing like this happens ever again." Supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in January while lawmakers counted President Joe Biden 's electoral victory. Five people, including a Capitol police officer, died due to the attack. The mob descended on the legislature after the former president made weeks of unfounded claims that widespread fraud cost him the presidential race against Biden. The House impeached Trump during his final days in the White House for inciting an insurrection. The Senate acquitted him after he left office. Democrats and some Republicans have insisted lawmakers need to better understand what led to the violent attempt to disrupt the transfer of power. They have questioned how intelligence and security failings allowed rioters chanting "Hang Mike Pence" and seeking out House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to get within moments of finding the top government officials. Many Republicans — some of whom voted not to count certified state election results after Congress was retaken from the mob — have questioned the need for a commission to study the events of Jan. 6. Most of the GOP has either tried to move on from the insurrection, or downplay the attack. Speaking to reporters Friday morning, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called it "very concerning" that the panel was expected to investigate Capitol security only related to Jan. 6 and not Good Friday, when a man rammed a car into a checkpoint and killed a Capitol police officer. McCarthy said he had not read the announced agreement. In a statement Friday, Pelosi said, "it is imperative that we seek the truth of what happened on January 6 with an independent, bipartisan 9/11-type Commission to examine and report upon the facts, causes and security relating to the terrorist mob attack." The California Democrat reiterated that the House expects to move forward with a separate bill to provide supplemental funding for Capitol security. The commission announcement comes days after House Republicans removed Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., from her leadership post as she hammered Trump for spreading conspiracy theories about the election. Cheney, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach the former president, broke with McCarthy in supporting a commission that would focus only on the Jan. 6 insurrection. A hearing this week also underscored the Republican efforts to minimize the attack on the Capitol. Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., claimed it was not an insurrection but a "normal tourist visit."

The bipartisan infrastructure deal that President Joe Biden hopes to reach with Republicans gained steam this week. Biden displayed willingness to narrow the scope of the bill to traditional infrastructure items and to compromise on various ways to pay for them. The White House expects a Republican counterproposal by Tuesday.	WASHINGTON — The bipartisan infrastructure deal that President Joe Biden hopes to reach with Republicans gained steam this week, after Biden displayed willingness to narrow the scope of the bill to traditional infrastructure items and to compromise on various ways to pay for them. In meetings at the White House with key Democratic and Republican senators, the president made it clear that he is willing to divide his mammoth infrastructure proposal, the $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan, into separate bills in order to pass the first part of the package with bipartisan support in the Senate. "I want to get a bipartisan deal on as much as we can get a bipartisan deal on," Biden told MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell in an interview Wednesday. "That means roads, bridges, broadband, all infrastructure." "Let's see if we can get an agreement to kickstart this, and then fight over what's left, and see if I can get it done without Republicans, if need be," said Biden. The starting point for negotiations this week was the $568 billion "Republican Roadmap" infrastructure plan, unveiled in April by West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, the ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Even before talks began, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday that Republicans would be open to spending up to $800 billion on an infrastructure package. His remarks telegraphed to the White House that Republicans were open to going beyond what was outlined in the road map. On Thursday, six senior Republican senators delivered the same message to Biden at a key meeting, led by Moore Capito. At the outset, Biden said that he was "prepared to compromise." The senators were ready to talk nuts and bolts. The senators attending the Oval Office meeting all serve as ranking members on committees with jurisdiction over infrastructure. In addition to Moore Capito, the meeting included Sens. John Barrasso of Wyoming, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Roger Wicker of Mississippi. Over the course of 90 minutes, Moore Capito said, the group discussed specific infrastructure items and Biden asked them to return next week with a revised offer that he could then counter. The White House said Friday that Biden expects the GOP counterproposal by Tuesday. "We're very encouraged, we feel very committed to the bipartisanship that we think this infrastructure package can carry forward," she added. As Republicans prepare a second offer in the coming days to deliver to Biden, there's a growing acceptance among Democratic lawmakers of Biden's preference for passing a trimmed-down, bipartisan infrastructure bill first and then a much bigger domestic spending bill, likely without Republican votes, after that. In addition to passing what had been left out of the American Jobs Plan, Democrats would also look to incorporate the second part of Biden's domestic agenda, the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan , into a bill they would pass on a straight party-line vote. This second piece includes funding for two years of free universal pre-K and two years of free community college, subsidizing child care for middle-class families and expanding paid family leave and child tax credits. This is also where tax increases on both corporations and the wealthiest Americans would most likely be enacted. "From the Democrats' point of view, what doesn't happen now will happen later," said Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank. "They'll be able to take a big win on this bipartisan deal and then pass the rest of the agenda later this year on budget reconciliation." "A year from now, what the public will remember is that Biden led off with a bipartisan infrastructure deal," said Bennett. "No one's going to say, 'Well, this bit of spending was in the bipartisan bill, and that bit was in the reconciliation bill. It's all going to be Biden's agenda." As Democrats gradually get used to the idea of a bipartisan deal first and a bigger bill later, it also becomes easier for the White House to compromise on its initial plan to use corporate tax hikes to pay for much of the infrastructure spending. In its place, Democrats are increasingly open to paying for a pared-down infrastructure plan through a mix of revenue generators, including user fees and bonds. On Thursday, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told Axios that user fees "have to be part of the mix." User fees remain a sticking point, though. The White House said Friday that Biden would consider user fees a violation of his pledge not to raise taxes on those making less than $400,000 a year. Avoiding a corporate tax increase would have the advantage of all but guaranteeing that the bill would win support from key industry groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers. Jay Timmons, CEO of NAM, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Friday that his members strongly support Biden's plan to invest heavily in infrastructure . But he said raising the corporate tax rate would do more harm than good. "We've presented other options," said Timmons, "such as public-private partnerships, user fees, and bonds for the financing of very large infrastructure investments." Stepping back, it's possible to see the outlines of what a compromise bill might look like, provided both Democrats and Republicans can continue moving closer to one another's priorities. This means that Republicans keep increasing the size and scope of their offer, Biden agrees to limit the bill to hard infrastructure only, and Democrats agree to fund it by some other means. Both Biden and Republicans say they want to move swiftly, and they've set Memorial Day as an informal deadline for making real progress. That's in a little more than two weeks.
House Republicans voted to make Rep. Elise Stefanik their conference chair, days after ousting Rep. Liz Cheney from the role over her opposition to former President Donald Trump Stefanik, a fourth-term congresswoman from New York, garnered clout within her party in 2019 when she defended Trump during his first impeachment trial. Cheney has been denounced within her party for refusing to stop blasting Trump for spreading baseless conspiracy theories about his election loss.	House Republicans voted Friday to make Rep. Elise Stefanik their conference chair, days after ousting Rep. Liz Cheney over her opposition to former President Donald Trump 's continued influence in the party and her denouncements of his "big lie" that the 2020 election was rigged. Republicans convened around 8:30 a.m. ET at the Congressional Visitors Center, the same room where they expelled Cheney from the No. 3-ranking position by a voice vote two days earlier. The vote for Stefanik was conducted by secret ballot. The final tally was 134-46. Stefanik, a fourth-term congresswoman from upstate New York, garnered national attention and clout within her party in 2019 when she forcefully defended Trump during his first impeachment trial. "My focus is on unity, because that's what the American people, and that's what our voters, deserve," Stefanik told reporters after the vote. She thanked Trump, who had endorsed her for the role over Cheney, calling the former president "a critical part of our Republican team." Cheney has been denounced within her party for refusing to stop blasting Trump for spreading baseless conspiracy theories about his election loss to President Joe Biden. While federal officials said there was no widespread voter fraud and dozens of court cases from Trump's allies failed to reverse any state's election outcomes, Trump has nevertheless refused to concede to Biden. The former president continues to falsely assert he won the election, and that it was "stolen" from him. Cheney blames Trump directly for the Jan. 6 invasion of the Capitol by a mob of his supporters. She was one of just 10 Republicans to vote to impeach Trump in the House on a charge of inciting an insurrection, and since that vote, she has continued to argue that Trump poses a danger to the country if the Republican Party fails to condemn him. Trump was acquitted in the Senate. Trump "risks inciting further violence," Cheney said on the House floor on the eve of the vote to strip her of her leadership role. He "continues to undermine our democratic process, sowing seeds of doubt about whether democracy really works at all," she said. Stefanik was endorsed by Trump and House Republican leaders Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise, both of whom suggested Cheney's focus was detracting from the GOP's goal of winning back the House in 2022. While Stefanik's status as the front-runner to replace Cheney was never in doubt, some conservatives complained that the less-experienced congresswoman was not conservative enough for the job. She faced a last-minute challenge from Texas Rep. Chip Roy , backed by Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, and has faced criticism from some conservative groups. "Elise Stefanik is NOT a good spokesperson for the House Republican Conference," the conservative Club for Growth tweeted last week. "House Republicans should find a conservative to lead messaging and win back the House Majority.
Shareholders of $100 million New Jersey deli company Hometown International fired CEO Paul Morina and the firm's vice president after weeks of questions about the company and his role there. A related shell company, E-Waste, also replaced its president, John Rollo, with a man who has been business partners with former NBA superstar Paul Pierce. Major investors in Hometown and E-Waste are based in Hong Kong and Macao. A person familiar with the situation told CNBC that the moves to replace the executives are part of ongoing housecleaning effort at both companies.	The shareholders of the mystery $100 million New Jersey deli company Hometown International fired CEO Paul Morina — a high school principal and renowned wrestling coach — after weeks of questions about the firm and his role there, a financial filing revealed late Friday . Hometown International's majority shareholders also voted to remove the company's only other executive, vice president and secretary Christine Lindenmuth, who works with Morina as an administrator at nearby Paulsboro High School. The deli, located just across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, is Hometown's only operating business asset. Their ousters came a week after a previously unreported resignation of the president of a shell company, E-Waste , which has multiple connections to Hometown International. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show that the shareholders that voted to remove Morina and Lindenmuth almost certainly included all or some members of two different groups of investment entities, one based in Hong Kong, the other based in Macao, a special administrative region in China. The moves at Hometown International and E-Waste appear — like other recent ones by each of the money-losing companies — to be an attempt to eliminate controversial issues that could harm their joint goal of merging with other firms in a transaction that would exploit their status as publicly traded companies on U.S. markets. Such a transaction would financially benefit existing shareholders. A person familiar with the situation confirmed to CNBC later Saturday that the moves to replace the executives are part of ongoing housecleaning effort at both companies. This person declined to be named. Morina, 62, held a slew of other titles at Hometown International before he was removed. According to financial filings, he owns 1.5 million common shares of the deli owner, making him, on paper at least, worth more than $18 million. Morina was replaced as chief executive officer by Peter Coker Jr., who is Hometown International's chairman. Coker Jr., who is based in Hong Kong, is aligned with the investment entities there that have major stakes in the deli owner. Coker Jr.'s father, North Carolina businessman Peter Coker Sr. , himself is a major investor in the company . The related shell company E-Waste replaced its own president, John Rollo, 66, after similar questions were raised by CNBC about him, that company and its similarly preposterous sky-high market capitalization despite a total lack of ongoing business. Rollo, a Grammy-winning recording engineer, until recently was working as patient transporter at a New Jersey hospital. Rollo, also a New Jersey resident, was replaced as E-Waste's president by 31-year-old Elliot Mermel, a California resident who is getting paid $8,000 per month in that role. Mermel's colorful business background includes founding a company that raised crickets as human food, and a partnership in a cannabis-related business with Paul Pierce , the former Boston Celtics superstar basketball player . Pierce, who won an NBA title with the Celtics, last month was fired as an analyst by ESPN for a racy Instagram Live poss that showed him in a room with exotic dancers. On Saturday, the Boston Globe reported that Pierce will be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as part of its 2021 class. Mermel also founded a biotech company and an artificial intelligence company, and was a business development consultant to a fertilizer company, according to a financial filing. Mermel, a Colby University graduate, has another company, Benzions LLC, that had been collecting $4,000 each month since December under a consulting agreement with E-Waste. That agreement was terminated as part of his taking over management of E-Waste, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Thursday. SEC filings show that Benzions in March signed another consulting agreement with a second shell company, Med Spa Vacations, connected to Peter Coker Sr., which likewise pays Mermel's firm $4,000 per month. The current president of Med Spa Vacations is former E-Waste president Rollo, who took that job in February, according to filings. The changes in executive leadership at both Hometown International and E-Waste were disclosed in 8-K filings with the SEC. The deli owner's filing gave no reason why shareholders who control 6 million shares of common stock — which represents about 77% of the company's voting power — voted out Morina and the 46-year-old Lindenmuth. At least 5.5 million of Hometown International's common shares are controlled by the Hong Kong and Macao investors. Both Morina and Lindenmuth remain principals in the deli itself, according to the SEC filing. Morina also is involved in an entity that leases the deli space to Hometown International. E-Waste's filing said that Rollo resigned as president on May 7, a day after CNBC reported on the opaque nature of the Macao group of investors . CNBC did not immediately receive replies to requests for comment from Morina, Lindenmuth, Rollo, Mermel and Hometown International's lawyer. A spokesman for Maso Capital and its founder Manoj Jain — who controls the investments for the Hong Kong entities invested in Hometown International — declined to comment. Hometown International first drew widespread attention last month when hedge fund manager David Einhorn, in a letter to clients, pointed out the company's market capitalization, which had topped $100 million despite owning only a single small Italian deli. That eatery had sales of less than $37,000 in sales for the past two years combined and was closed for nearly half of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Einhorn noted the incongruity of Morina being Hometown International's CEO while working his day jobs as high school principal and wrestling coach. Morina's team at Paulsboro high school is a perennial contender for state titles, and he is among the most successful coaches in New Jersey wrestling history. But he has no apparent history of operating either a publicly traded company or food service business before the Hometown Deli opened in his own hometown. However, Morina, whose brother is a New Jersey county sheriff, wrestled in the 1970s at Paulsboro High School with a man named James Patten, who works at Coker Sr.'s firm Tryon Capital. Patten was barred by FINRA, the broker-dealer regulator, from acting as a stockbroker or associating with broker-dealers, according to the regulator's database. Before that sanction, Patten was the subject of repeated disciplinary actions by FINRA, which included not complying with an arbitration award of more than $753,000 for violating securities laws, unauthorized trading and churning a client's account. Since Einhorn's letter, CNBC has reported other eyebrow-raising details about Hometown International and revealed its connections to E-Waste. The stocks of both companies, which trade on the low-tier Pink over-the-counter market, in the past year have risen to stunning levels as ties have been formed between them. Those stock price increases have raised the the question was why some investors would pay so much to buy what is relatively speaking handfuls of shares in either thinly traded company, given their lack of meaningful revenue in the deli owner's case, or, in E-Waste's case, a lack of any revenue at all. Even if both companies achieve their goal of engaging in reverse mergers or similar transactions with private firms looking to become publicly traded, current investors will not receive payments that reflect — in any way — the trading price of the stocks. On Friday, just 205 shares of Hometown International were traded , closing at $12.40 per share. Given the company's nearly 8 million shares of common stock outstanding, that gives it a market capitalization of $96.68 million. E-Waste closed Friday at $9 per share , after no shares traded hands. With 12.5 million shares outstanding, E-Waste has a market cap of $112.5 million. In recent weeks, both the deli owner and E-Waste disavowed their stock prices, saying in extraordinary SEC filings that there was no financial justification for their market capitalizations. The moves followed the demotion of Hometown International from a more prestigious OTCQB over-the-counter market platform for what OTC Markets Group called "irregularities" in their public disclosures, and OTC Markets telling CNBC that it would be eyeing E-Waste as well. A trio of Hong Kong investment entities led by Maso Capital, which last year became some of the largest investors in Hometown International's biggest investors, are understood to be involved in likewise positioning E-Waste as a reverse merger candidate. The Hong Kong investors include entities that are investment arms of Duke and Vanderbilt universities. E-Waste's biggest single investor, Macao-based Global Equity Limited, is also the largest investor in the deli owner, and in Med Spa Vacations, another shell company linked to Coker Sr.. Rollo remains the president of Med Spa Vacations, a shell company with no business operations whose office address is that of a business operated by Coker Sr. Hometown International loaned Med Spa Vacations $150,000 in February, records show. That loan came after E-Waste was loaned an identical amount by Hometown International in November, according to an SEC filing. Records show that Coker Sr. loaned E-Waste $255,000 last September, most of which was used to pay the prior owners of E-Waste before they sold their shares to Global Equity Lmiited. CNBC's articles have detailed how Coker Sr., a former college basketball star who has refused to comment when contacted by a reporter, has been sued for allegedly hiding assets from a creditor to whom he owed nearly $900,000 and for business-related fraud. He denied wrongdoing in those cases. He also has been arrested for soliciting a prostitute, according to a Raleigh, North Carolina, police report, and for exposing himself to and trying to proposition three underage girls, according to a 1992 newspaper article. A firm controlled by Coker Sr., Tryon Capital, had until recently been collecting $15,000 a month from Hometown International under a consulting agreement. E-Waste was paying Tryon Capital $2,500 per month for its own consulting agreement. Those agreements were terminated last month after CNBC articles described those deals and Coker's tangled legal history. SEC filings show that Med Spa Vacations is paying Tryon Capital $2,500 per month for its own consulting agreement. Coker Sr.'s partner in Tryon Capital, Peter Reichard, in 2011 was convicted in a North Carolina court of his role in a scheme that facilitated the illegal contributions of thousands of dollars to the successful 2008 campaign for governor by Bev Perdue, a Democrat. The scheme involved the use of bogus consulting contracts with Tryon Capital. Coker Sr. was not charged in that case. Reichard is also a managing member, with Coker Sr., of an entity called Europa Capital Investments, which owns 90,400 common shares of Hometown International, and has warrants for another 1.9 million shares. Reichard is the son of Ram Dass, the late spiritual and LSD guru who gained renown in the 1960s and 1970s. CNBC earlier this week detailed how Coker Sr. and Reichard in 2010 created eight shell companies that were later sold off to other owners. Most of those shell companies, after they were sold, ended up having their registrations revoked by the SEC for failing to keep current in their disclosure filings, records show. One of the companies ended up being owned by a real estate tax lawyer in New York named Allan Schwartz, who did work for former President Donald Trump decades ago in connection with Trump's real estate holdings. Schwartz told CNBC he knew nothing about Reichard and Coker Sr., or the deli owner. Records show that a securities lawyer named Gregg Jaclin was involved in the creation of those shell companies. Jaclin also was involved three years later in the creation of Hometown International. Jaclin was disbarred as an attorney last year after pleading guilty to federal criminal charges related to his creation of shell companies to sell to individuals "who used those shell companies as publicly traded vehicles for market manipulation schemes," court records show . None of the shells in that scheme were one of the ones created by Coker Sr. and Reichard, or to Hometown International.
President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday amid intensifying violence in the Middle East. During the call with Netanyahu, the president reiterated his support for Israel's right to self-defense against rocket attacks from Hamas in Gaza, according to a readout released by the White House. Biden also raised concerns about journalists' safety after Israeli forces leveled a building that housed offices of media outlets including the Associated Press.	President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday as the violence in Israel and the Gaza Strip escalated with no sign that it would cease any time soon. Separately, Netanyahu, after his call with Biden, suggested on television late Saturday local time that Israel's operation will continue until it achieves its goals. "Our aim is to send Hamas a message that it's not worth sending rockets next time they want," he said. "We will deal with them and no one should take the law into their own hands." During a phone call with Netanyahu, Biden reiterated his support for Israel's right to self-defense against rocket attacks from the militant group Hamas in Gaza and condemned attacks in towns and cities in Israel, according to a readout released by the White House. "The President noted that this current period of conflict has tragically claimed the lives of Israeli and Palestinian civilians, including children," the readout said. "He raised concerns about the safety and security of journalists and reinforced the need to ensure their protection." Netanyahu told Biden that Israel "is doing everything to avoid harming" those who aren't involved with Hamas and that "those not involved" were evacuated from the 12-story building in the Gaza Strip that housed the offices of The Associated Press and Al Jazeera. Three Israeli heavy missiles collapsed the building on Saturday. The president also spoke with Abbas about tensions in Jerusalem and the West Bank and their shared interest in making Jerusalem "a place of peaceful coexistence for people of all faiths and backgrounds." "The President also underscored his strong commitment to a negotiated two-state solution as the best path to reach a just and lasting resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," according to a readout from that call. The extraordinary conflagration in Israel and the Gaza Strip has evolved into an urgent early test for Biden's foreign policy. The president was working in the Oval Office for a period of time on Saturday. He usually works from Camp David or his home state of Delaware during weekends. News that media offices were destroyed triggered international outrage and shock, prompting the White House to respond before the Biden readouts were released. The Biden administration has "communicated directly to the Israelis that ensuring the safety and security of journalists and independent media is a paramount responsibility," White House press secretary Jen Psaki wrote in a tweet on Saturday. The president of the Associated Press, in a statement Saturday, said a dozen AP journalists and freelancers evacuated the building before the strike, but a "terrible loss of life" was narrowly avoided even with advance warning from Israel that the building would be hit. "We are shocked and horrified that the Israeli military would target and destroy the building housing AP's bureau and other news organizations in Gaza," said AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt. "They have long known the location of our bureau and knew journalists were there. We received a warning that the building would be hit." "This is an incredibly disturbing development," Pruitt said of the airstrike. Al Jazeera's director general accused Israel of trying to silence the media and condemned the airstrike as a war crime, calling on the international community to hold Israel accountable. "The destruction of Al Jazeera offices and that of other media organizations in al-Jalaa tower in Gaza is a blatant violation of human rights and is internationally considered a war crime," said Dr. Mostefa Souag, acting director general of Al Jazeera Media Network, in an article posted on the news agency's website. "We call on the international community to condemn such barbaric actions and targeting of journalists and we demand an immediate international action to hold Israel accountable for its deliberate targeting of journalists and the media institutions," Souag said. "The aim of this heinous crime is to silence the media and to hide the untold carnage and suffering of the people of Gaza," Souag said. At least 139 people have been killed, including 39 children, in Gaza. And in Israel, eight people have been killed as conflict escalates. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in a statement Saturday called for a "full accounting of actions that have led to civilian deaths and destruction of media outlets." "All political and military leaders have a responsibility to uphold the rules and laws of war and it is of the utmost importance for all actors to find ways to deescalate and reduce tensions," he said. "This violence must end." —Reuters and Associated Press contributed reporting
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday called the violent conflict between Israel and Gaza militants "utterly appalling" and urged for an immediate ceasefire. "This latest round of violence only perpetuates the cycles of death, destruction and despair, and pushes farther to the horizon any hopes of coexistence and peace," Guterres said during a U.N. security council meeting. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said there will be no immediate end to Israel's campaign against militant groups. Israeli airstrikes killed at least 42 Palestinians, including 10 children, in Gaza early on Sunday, bringing the death toll in Gaza to at least 188 since the fighting began Monday.	United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday called the violent conflict between Israel and Gaza militants "utterly appalling" and urged for an immediate ceasefire, as the worst outbreak of fighting in years stretches into seven days and takes a heavy toll on civilians. "This latest round of violence only perpetuates the cycles of death, destruction and despair, and pushes farther to the horizon any hopes of coexistence and peace," Guterres said during a U.N. Security Council meeting. "Fighting must stop. It must stop immediately. Rockets and mortars on one side and aerial and artillery bombardments on the other must stop," he said. "I appeal to all parties to heed this call." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said there will be no immediate end to Israel's campaign against militant groups. Israeli airstrikes killed at least 42 Palestinians, including 10 children, in Gaza early on Sunday, according to Gaza health officials, bringing the death toll in Gaza to at least 188 since the fighting began Monday. In Israel, 10 people have been killed in rocket attacks by Hamas and other militant groups. "We'll do whatever it takes to restore order. It will take some time," Netanyahu said during an interview on CBS' "Face the Nation." "I hope it won't take long. It's not immediate." Israel and Hamas, which governs the Gaza strip, have both vowed to continue cross-border fire after Israel targeted and destroyed a high-rise building in Gaza City that housed some media offices . Hamas fired 120 rockets overnight in retaliation for the destruction of the al-Jalaa building, though many were intercepted. "Our campaign against the terrorist organizations is continuing with full force," Netanyahu said in a televised speech. "We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore calm and quiet to you, Israel's citizens." Netanyahu argued that Israelis had received intelligence that the Gaza building housed Hamas military offices, but didn't offer evidence. "It is a perfectly legitimate target," he said of the building, adding that the military provided warnings to civilians to evacuate. The AP has condemned the attack and demanded that Israel provide evidence that the building housed Hamas offices. "We have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building," AP said in a statement. Guterres said the U.N. is actively engaging all sides toward an immediate ceasefire. "The fighting risks dragging Israelis and Palestinians into a spiral of violence with devastating consequences for both communities and for the entire region," Guterres said. "It has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis and to further foster extremism, not only in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel, but in the region as a whole, potentially creating a new locus of dangerous instability," he said. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield on Sunday did not call for a ceasefire but said the U.S. would offer support if the parties seek a ceasefire. "The United States has made clear that we are prepared to lend our support and good offices should the parties seek a ceasefire, because we believe Israelis and Palestinians equally have a right to live in safety and security," Greenfield said at the U.N. security council meeting. President Joe Biden spoke to Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday to address the intensifying conflict. Biden's envoy, Hady Amr, also arrived in Israel on Friday as part of the administration's efforts to de-escalate the fighting. The president has reiterated his support for Israel's right to self-defense against rocket attacks , but shared concerns with Abbas that "innocent civilians, including children, have tragically lost their lives amidst the ongoing violence," according to a readout of the call released by the White House. Biden on Saturday also re-affirmed a "strong commitment to a negotiated two-state solution as the best path to reach a just and lasting resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," according to a readout from the call with Abbas. But fighting continues despite diplomatic efforts to end the conflict and avoid more civilian casualties. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-C.A., chairman of the U.S Committee on Intelligence, urged for a cease-fire during a Sunday morning interview on CBS. "I think the administration needs to push harder on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to stop the violence," Schiff said. — Reuters contributed reporting
The move to blast Bezos in front of his home comes as President Biden and Democratic lawmakers are looking to to raise taxes on corporations and those making over $400,000 in order to pay for $2 trillion infrastructure proposal. Mobile billboards will also make appearances in front of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's D.C. residence and the offices of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in New York City.	Millionaires who have called on the rich to pay more in taxes are launching protests in New York and Washington on Monday — Tax Day — including in front of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' homes. The effort is being organized by the Patriotic Millionaires, whose members boast annual incomes of over $1 million or assets worth over $5 million. The details of the effort were first shared with CNBC. The group plans to launch its Tax Day campaign on Monday, and includes mobile billboards that will make stops in front of Bezos' homes in New York and Washington. Leaders of the Patriotic Millionaires told CNBC they are organizing a group of up to 30 protesters to converge on to Bezos' New York residence with a billboard that says "Cut the bull----. Tax the rich." The move to blast Bezos in front of his home comes as President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers seek to raise taxes on corporations and those making over $400,000 in order to pay for their $2 trillion infrastructure proposal. Biden h as recently said he'd like a corporate tax hike of 25% to 28% , while proposing to raise the top income tax rate from 37% to 39.6%. Republicans have said they don't want to raise any taxes to pay for infrastructure. The two parties are trying to come up with a bipartisan bill and have said they are making progress. But progressives are eager to see billionaires pay more. "Jeff Bezos is the poster child for the total idiocy of the country's tax code," Erica Payne, founder and president of the group, told CNBC on Friday. She said Bezos' extreme wealth means he should be paying more in taxes. She noted that the tech tycoon is reportedly in the midst of building a nearly 417-foot yacht that's likely to cost over $500 million. Bezos has a net worth of over $185 billion, according to Forbes, and has been a target of progressives for the need to raise taxes on the wealthy. A spokesperson for Amazon did not return a request for comment but Bezos has said he supports raising corporate taxes. The New York Post reported in 2019 that Bezos spent $80 million on three apartments in the same New York building to create a mega-home. A year later, the Post reported on Bezos buying a $16 million home within the same apartment complex. The Patriotic Millionaires are in favor of Sen. Elizabeth Warren's ultra millionaires tax plan , which would put a  2% annual tax on wealth over $50 million, rising to 3% for wealth over $1 billion. Morris Pearl, chairman of the group and a former BlackRock executive, told CNBC that the organization will be pushing for a wealth tax, among other tax increase proposals, throughout Tax Day. Others on the Patriotic Millionaires advisory board include Abigail and Tim Disney, two children of the late longtime Disney executive, Roy Disney. The mobile billboards will also make appearances in front of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's Washington residence, the offices of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in New York City, and D.C.-based places including the Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable, Heritage Foundation, Democratic National Committee, Americans for Tax Reform, the IRS and former President Donald Trump's Old Post Office hotel. Bezos ' $23 million D.C. mansion was once the old Textile Museum. The other billboard being featured in the day-long campaign has the laughing faces of Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. One of the billboards says "tax the rich. Save America. Yes it really is that simple." Another has the three business leaders laughing and reads "tax me if you can."
The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear arguments in a major abortion case from Mississippi that could roll back limits on abortion laws cemented by the landmark reproductive rights case Roe v. Wade. The case will be the first major abortion dispute to test all three of former President Donald Trump's appointees to the top court, including its newest member, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. The top court announced in an order that it will hear the dispute, Dobbs vs. Jackson Women's Health Organization, 19-1392. The court will hear the case in its term beginning in October and a decision is likely to come by June of 2022.	The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear arguments in a major abortion case from Mississippi that could roll back limits on abortion laws cemented by the landmark reproductive rights case Roe v. Wade. The case will be the first major abortion dispute to test all three of former President Donald Trump's appointees to the top court, including its newest member, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. The top court announced in an order that it will hear the dispute, Dobbs vs. Jackson Women's Health Organization, 19-1392. The court will hear the case in its term beginning in October and a decision is likely to come by June 2022. The case concerns a Mississippi abortion law passed in 2018 that bars abortions after 15 weeks with limited exceptions. The law was blocked by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Under existing Supreme Court precedent, states may not ban abortions that occur prior to fetal viability, generally around 22 weeks or later. In the case, Mississippi is asking the justices to reexamine that viability standard. The state argued that the viability rule prevented states from adequately defending maternal health and potential life. "It is well past time for the Court to revisit the wisdom of the viability bright-line rule," Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch wrote in a brief filed with the justices. The Mississippi abortion clinic that challenged the law, Jackson Women's Health Organization, urged the top court not to take the case. "In an unbroken line of decisions over the last fifty years, this Court has held that the Constitution guarantees each person the right to decide whether to continue a pre-viability pregnancy," Hillary Schneller, an attorney representing the clinic, wrote in a filing. Schneller said that Mississippi's argument was "based on a misunderstanding of the core principle of" previous Supreme Court decisions. She wrote, "while the State has interests throughout pregnancy, '[b]efore viability, the State's interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion.'" Conservatives have been passing a flurry of bills challenging Roe, decided in 1973, with the hope of getting the court to reconsider its past precedents. With Trump's appointees, the nation's highest court now has a 6-3 conservative majority. The fight over abortion animated the confirmation hearings for Barrett, a devout Catholic who was the favorite among anti-abortion groups to succeed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg following the liberal justice's death. While Barrett has not made her precise legal views on abortion clear from the bench, Democrats have seized on her past comments referring to aborted fetuses as "unborn victims" among other potential harbingers of her views. The other two Trump appointees on the bench, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, voted last June to allow a restrictive Louisiana abortion law to go into effect in the first significant reproductive rights case to come before them. Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, sided with the liberals in the 5-4 decision blocking the law. President Joe Biden, who campaigned on protecting access to abortion, "is committed to codifying Roe," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a briefing Monday. Psaki declined to comment specifically on the Mississippi case. "The president and the vice president are devoted to ensuring that every American has access to health care, including reproductive health care, regardless of their income, zip code, race, health insurance status, or immigration status," she said. In a statement, Center for Reproductive Rights President Nancy Northup said, "Alarm bells are ringing loudly about the threat to reproductive rights." The Center for Reproductive Rights represented the abortion clinic alongside the law firm Paul Weiss and the Mississippi Center for Justice. "The consequences of a Roe reversal would be devastating. Over 20 states would prohibit abortion outright. Eleven states —including Mississippi — currently have trigger bans on the books which would instantaneously ban abortion if Roe is overturned," Northup said. Diane Derzis, owner of Jackson Women's Health Organization, said in a statement that "as the only abortion clinic left in Mississippi, we see patients who have spent weeks saving up the money to travel here and pay for childcare, for a place to stay, and everything else involved." "If this ban were to take effect, we would be forced to turn many of those patients away, and they would lose their right to abortion in this state," Derzis said. Fitch, the Mississippi attorney general, said that the state's legislature had "enacted this law consistent with the will of its constituents to promote women's health and preserve the dignity and sanctity of life." "I remain committed to advocating for women and defending Mississippi's legal right to protect the unborn," she said. Anti-abortion groups cheered the Supreme Court's move. Susan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser said that the court's decision to hear the case was a "landmark opportunity," citing the enormous number of bills passed recently aimed at restricting abortion access. "Across the nation, state lawmakers acting on the will of the people have introduced 536 pro-life bills aimed at humanizing our laws and challenging the radical status quo imposed by Roe ," she said.
Lawyers for Rudy Giuliani cited communications he would have had with then-President Donald Trump in a new letter attacking the legitimacy of a 2019 federal search warrant for an iCloud account belonging to the former New York City mayor. That search, which until recently was unknown to Giuliani, came two years before the search in late April of Giuliani's Manhattan apartment and office as part of an ongoing federal criminal probe related to his dealings in Ukraine. Giuliani's lawyers argue that there are serious questions about the legitimacy of the iCloud warrant and the propriety of federal prosecutors reviewing material seized from that account because of the risk of violating attorney-client privilege attached to both Giuliani and Trump.	Lawyers for Rudy Giuliani cited communications he would have had with then-President Donald Trump in a letter to a judge attacking the legitimacy of a 2019 federal search warrant for an iCloud account belonging to the former New York City mayor. That search, which until recently was unknown to Giuliani, came two years before the search in late April of his Manhattan apartment and office as part of an ongoing federal criminal probe related to Giuliani's dealings in Ukraine. In 2019, Giuliani and other allies of Trump had sought damaging information on now-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, whose business dealings in Ukraine had come under scrutiny. Those efforts to dig up dirt on the Bidens became a central component of Trump's first impeachment proceeding. Trump was impeached in the House and acquitted in the Senate. Giuliani's lawyers argue that there are serious questions about the legitimacy of the iCloud warrant and the propriety of federal prosecutors reviewing material seized from that account because of the risk of violating attorney-client privilege attached to both Giuliani and Trump. Giuliani has served as Trump's personal lawyer. "In this case, federal prosecutors have taken the unprecedented step of covertly seizing data and files of the personal attorney to the former President of the United States," wrote the lawyers, Robert Costello and Arthur Aidala, to Manhattan federal court Judge J. Paul Oetken in their letter sent last week. "Prior to the executions of the warrants at issue [the ones issued for the searches in April] prosecutors obtained the entirety of Giuliani's iCloud, which certainly had communications with, and on behalf of, the sitting President, containing material relating to the impending impeachment, the welfare of the country, and to national security," the attorneys wrote in the letter, which was unsealed Monday. The lawyers asked Oetken to unseal the 2019 iCloud warrant so that they can review the legitimacy of affidavits that would have been filed as part of an application to a judge to get permission for prosecutors to seize Giuliani's data while he was working for Trump. "Another reason Giuliani should be entitled to review the Government's application is the possibility that information seized in secret and kept secret from Giuliani for a year and a half was leaked to the House Impeachment Committee," the letter said. The lawyers told Oetken that they want him to first resolve whether prosecutors' conduct regarding Giuliani has been legal before he considers whether to appoint a so-called special master to review material seized from Giuliani's office and home. The special master would determine what information seized in the recent raid is privileged, and what can be turned over to federal investigators. "The validity of the 2019 covert warrant, and the handling of the information obtained by the prosecutor are serious questions that must be resolved before any further damage is done," wrote the lawyers. "Moreover, the fruits of that 2019 search were certainly used in some part to secure the 2021 largely duplicative search warrant and subsequent seizures," the letter said. "It is for those reasons that it is premature to consider a special master before these critical issues are resolved." FBI agents seized electronic devices from Giuliani's home and office during the searches on April 28. Giuliani's lawyers said in their letter that they have "serious concern over the broad and sweeping nature of the searches executed on an attorney's home and law office, and the covert search and review of the same attorney's iCloud account in 2019, and then, the failure to give notice to Giuliani and his clients, and withholding information about that search for 18 months." The lawyers also wrote that "during that period the government unilaterally reviewed all the information, privileged and not, and made entirely uninformed decisions about privilege (without any input from the clients or their counsel)." "This was during a period when the President was under investigation by that very office and the Justice Department of which they are an integral part," the letter said. In a separate letter, a lawyer for Republican attorney Victoria Toensing asked the judge to order the government to give back the materials that were seized from her in "covert" and "overt" searches. Like the letter from Giuliani, Toensing's letter argued that she should be allowed to review whether the seized materials are covered by attorney-client privilege protections. NBC News reported that FBI agents executed a search warrant on Toensing's Washington-area home on April 28, the same day that they raided Giuliani's properties. Toensing's letter specifies that electronic data had also been seized from her Google and iCloud accounts in "Covert Warrants" in 2019. Toensing's lawyer, Michael Bowe, asks the judge to order the government to return her iPhone 7 as well as her Google and iCloud data, then give her time to process the data and determine which items are privileged before the government reviews it. "Whatever its motivation, this exercise by the Government flies in the face of the Sixth Amendment and the most sacred attorney-client privilege," Bowe wrote. "At its core, this constitutionally intrusive exercise attempts to normalize a process that under all relevant jurisprudence, should not be, and indeed is not, normal." Giuliani is being investigated by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. He headed that federal prosecutors' office before becoming mayor in 1993.
Former Brooklyn Center Officer Kim Potter, who is white, will stand trial Dec. 6, barring any future scheduling conflicts, Hennepin County District Judge Regina Chu said during a pretrial hearing. "I do find that there's probable cause to support the charge against the defendant, Ms. Potter," Chu said.	A Minnesota judge ruled Monday that the manslaughter case can proceed against a former suburban Minneapolis police officer who fatally shot 20-year-old Black motorist Daunte Wright , and she set a trial date for December. Former Brooklyn Center Officer Kim Potter, who is white, will stand trial Dec. 6, barring any future scheduling conflicts, Hennepin County District Judge Regina Chu said during a pretrial hearing. "I do find that there's probable cause to support the charge against the defendant, Ms. Potter," Chu said. Potter, who is charged with second-degree manslaughter, appeared at the hearing via videoconference with her attorney, Earl Gray, and sat some distance behind him in his office. She looked straight ahead at the video screen and had little reaction during the hearing, saying, "Yes, your honor," when the judge asked if the hearing could go forward via videoconference. Potter did not enter a plea during the hearing. Wright was killed April 11 during a struggle with police after a traffic stop. The former Brooklyn Center police chief has said he believes Potter meant to use her Taser instead of her handgun. Body camera video shows her shouting "Taser!" multiple times before firing. Protesters and Wright's family have disputed that the shooting was accidental, arguing that an experienced officer knows the difference between a Taser and a handgun. They had wanted prosecutors to file murder charges. The shooting, which ignited days of unrest, happened amid the trial of Derek Chauvin, the white former Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of murder for pressing his knee against George Floyd's neck as the Black man said he couldn't breathe. Police have said Wright was pulled over for expired tags, but they sought to arrest him after discovering an outstanding warrant. The warrant was for his failure to appear in court on charges that he fled from officers and had a gun without a permit during an encounter with Minneapolis police in June. Intent isn't a necessary component of second-degree manslaughter in Minnesota. The charge — which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison — can be applied in circumstances where a person is suspected of causing a death by "culpable negligence" that creates an unreasonable risk and consciously takes chances to cause a death. As Monday's hearing began, Chu acknowledged that Wright's family and friends were listening and extended her condolences to them. After finding there was probable cause for the case to continue, she set deadlines for court filings, saying it would benefit everyone to expedite the case. Prosecutor Imran Ali said the Dec. 6 trial date works for now, but there may be conflicts with the schedules of expert witnesses, once they are determined. "My goal is to try to keep that Dec. 6 trial date if we at all possibly can," Chu said, adding: "If you need to schedule any type of plea hearing — if that should happen — I'm always available for that." Ali said the state wants audio and video coverage of the trial be allowed, while Gray objects to that. Unlike many states, cameras are not routinely allowed during most Minnesota court proceedings. Chauvin's murder trial was the first Minnesota criminal trial to be broadcast live on television, with the judge allowing the broadcast due to high interest and pandemic restrictions that limited courtroom space. The trial of Chauvin's three-co-defendants is also going to be broadcast. Brooklyn Center was moving toward firing Potter when she resigned shortly after the shooting . The city's police chief also resigned, after the City Council fired the city manager. On Saturday, Brooklyn Center's City Council approved a resolution that calls for sweeping changes in policing, including creating a new division of unarmed civilian employees to handle non-moving traffic violations and limiting situations in which officers can make arrests. The city attorney and mayor have said that adopting the resolution commits the city to change, but it is not a final action.
Joel Greenberg pleaded guilty to multiple crimes in a case that led to a sex trafficking investigation of Trump ally Rep. Matt Gaetz. Greenberg, a former Seminole County, Florida, tax collector, has agreed to cooperate and give "substantial assistance" to federal authorities in any investigation, which includes their probe of the Florida congressman. Gaetz, who has not been charged, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and specifically has denied having sex with a girl as young as 17 while he was an adult.	A friend of Rep. Matt Gaetz pleaded guilty Monday in federal court to multiple crimes — including sex trafficking of a minor girl — in the case that led to a sex trafficking investigation of the Republican lawmaker from Florida. Joel Greenberg, a former Seminole County, Florida, tax collector, also has agreed to cooperate and give "substantial assistance" to federal authorities in any investigation, which includes their probe of the Florida congressman Gaetz. Prosecutors will seek a reduced sentence against Greenberg if they agree that he has cooperated fully. Greenberg, who remains in jail pending sentencing, faces a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison for the sex trafficking charge alone. Gaetz, who has not been charged, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and specifically has denied having sex with a girl as young as 17 while he was an adult. The conservative represents Florida's First Congressional District in the panhandle and is a leading supporter of ex-President Donald Trump . Greenberg appeared in Orlando, Florida, federal court, to plead guilty to six of the 33 crimes that he was charged with. NBC News reported that Greenberg, who was in shackles, was wearing a jail jumpsuit and a blue surgical mask during his plea. Court records say his admitted criminal conduct included using a website to identify women that he later paid to engage in sexual acts "with him and others." Documents said Greenberg paid more $70,000 in 150 separate transactions to pay women for sex. One of those women was under age 18 "for part of the time" in which she was paid by Greenberg to engage in sex acts "with him and others," court documents say. Greenberg was accused of having sex with that woman at least seven times when she was a minor. "Other men who Greenberg introduced the minor to engaged in commercial sex acts with the minor in Greenberg's presence when the minor was under the age of 18," court records say. The other crimes that Greenberg has admitted to in court papers involve fraud and the creation of fake ID documents. Gaetz spokesman Harlan Hill last week noted that the first of a series of federal grand jury indictments against Greenberg alleged that he had falsely accused another man of having sex with a minor. "That man was apparently innocent. So is Congressman Gaetz," Hill said at the time. Gaetz last month hired criminal defense lawyer Marc Mukasey to represent him in the investigation. Mukasey also represents the Trump Organization in a criminal probe being conducted by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.
President Joe Biden said Monday that he will speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as fighting between Israel and Hamas enters its second week with no clear end in sight. Violence intensified over the weekend, with Israel conducting an airstrike that leveled homes in the Gaza Strip. The strike, the deadliest yet in the ongoing conflict, killed at least 42 people. Meanwhile, more than 3,000 rockets bombarded Israeli cities.	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Monday that he will speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as fighting between Israel and Hamas enters its second week with no clear end in sight. Biden said that he would have more to say about the unfolding violence after speaking with Netanyahu. On Sunday, a group of 28 Democratic senators called for an immediate stop to the ongoing fighting between Israel and Hamas. "To prevent any further loss of civilian life and to prevent further escalation of conflict in Israel and the Palestinian territories, we urge an immediate ceasefire," the senators wrote. The statement's signatories include Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Angus King of Maine, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mark Warner of Virginia and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. King and Sanders are independents who caucus with Democrats. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday called the violent conflict "utterly appalling" and urged an immediate cease-fire. "This latest round of violence only perpetuates the cycles of death, destruction and despair, and pushes farther to the horizon any hopes of coexistence and peace," Guterres said during a U.N. Security Council meeting . "Fighting must stop. It must stop immediately. Rockets and mortars on one side and aerial and artillery bombardments on the other must stop," he added. Violence intensified over the weekend, with Israel conducting an airstrike Sunday that leveled several homes in the Gaza Strip. The strike, the deadliest yet in the ongoing conflict, killed at least 42 people. Meanwhile, more than 3,000 rockets bombarded Israeli cities. On Sunday, Netanyahu defended the punishing airstrike on Saturday that collapsed a 12-story building housing international media, citing intelligence that Hamas was using a portion of the building to plan terror attacks. Netanyahu said that the building's occupants, which included the Associated Press, broadcaster Al-Jazeera and other media agencies, were given an hour's notice to evacuate before the strike. "Here's the intelligence we had," Netanyahu told CBS Sunday program "Face the Nation." "[It's] an intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organization housed in that building that plots and organizes the terror attacks against Israeli civilians. So, it's a perfectly legitimate target," he explained. White House press secretary Jen Psaki would not confirm whether the Biden administration agreed with Israeli intelligence assessments. She instead reiterated calls for a de-escalation in violence. "The role we are playing is, how can we help bring an end to the violence, and our calculation at this point is having those conversations behind the scenes," Psaki said Monday. "Our approach is quiet, intensive diplomacy." Over the weekend, President Joe Biden spoke separately to Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Biden raised concerns over the fierce fighting and the safety of civilians and journalists. He also underscored his commitment to a negotiated two-state solution as "the best path to reach a just and lasting resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," according to a readout. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters on Monday that officials across the administration are "working around the clock" to bring an end to the violence. Blinken added that U.S. envoy Hady Amr, deputy assistant secretary of State for Israel and Palestinian affairs, was on the ground in the region. — CNBC's Christina Wilkie contributed to this report. Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that the attack that killed 42 people destroyed several homes in the Gaza Strip on Sunday. The attack on a high-rise building that housed international media agencies occurred on Saturday.
WorkMoney, a nonprofit that launched last year at the height of the pandemic, is launching the effort, which includes digital ads on Facebook and Google. The targets of the campaign include Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema and republicans Lisa Murkowski, Pat Toomey and Shelley Moore Capito. Some of the lawmakers who will see pressure from WorkMoney have already been in touch with Biden and seem to be on the path to a compromise with the administration.	A group funded by anonymous donors is launching a big-money influence campaign this week that will pressure moderate lawmakers to pass key pieces of President Joe Biden's agenda. WorkMoney, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that launched last year at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, is moving ahead with a new $2 million effort that will include digital ads both on Facebook and Google. The campaign will also include the group's nearly 2 million members engaging through emails and other means with over a dozen lawmakers on the need to pass Biden's infrastructure and family plans through Congress. The nonprofit is known as a dark money group because it does not publicly disclose its donors. Founder CJ Grimes told CNBC in an email Monday that the group has raised over $20 million since its launch. Facebook's ad archive shows that the group has already spent over $5 million on ads in the buildup to this new campaign. Grimes told CNBC in a phone interview that the group is seeking organizers to help set up town halls and assist in reaching out to congressional representatives in the House and the Senate. Grimes later emailed the group's target list, which includes Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va. The organization believes that the support of many of these senators will be critical to seeing at least some elements of Biden's agenda passed. "WorkMoney members are talking to moderate Republicans and moderate Democrats because they are the ones who are most likely to shape the legislation that ultimately passes," Grimes said. "These moderates on both sides of the aisle are the politicians who most need to hear from their constituents." One of the new digital ads already live on WorkMoney's Facebook page calls for people to sign a petition in order to push Congress to pass Biden's infrastructure proposal. "It's time to quit the partisan games and invest in real American jobs. Tell your Congressperson: Pass the American Jobs Plan," the webpage reads after clicking the Facebook ad. Biden has proposed a $2 trillion infrastructure package that the president says should be paid for by raising the corporate and the top individual tax rates. Biden's $1.8 trillion family plan includes putting billions of federal money toward high-quality child care and creating a national comprehensive paid family and medical leave program. Some of the lawmakers who will see pressure from WorkMoney have already been in touch with Biden and seem to be on the path to a compromise with the administration. Moore Capito, Toomey and other Republican senators recently met with Biden to discuss infrastructure reform. "We had another positive and substantive discussion about how to address our nation's infrastructure challenges in a bipartisan way," Moore Capito said in a statement after the meeting. "We listened to one another, and I felt that the president was receptive to our ideas and viewpoints." Moore Capito and other Senate Republicans have proposed their own infrastructure framework that would cost over $565 billion and insist that raising taxes is not an option they are willing to consider to pay for it. A revised proposal from Republicans could be coming as soon as Tuesday. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he believes an infrastructure package should cost no more than $800 billion. Manchin, who is a moderate Democrat, has said he would be willing to agree on an infrastructure package that raises the corporate rate from 21% to around 25%. Biden needs 10 Republican votes in order to pass a bipartisan bill through the Senate.
Democratic Rep. Val Demings plans to launch a Senate challenge against Republican incumbent Marco Rubio next year, a source told CNBC. Demings had been rumored to be laying the groundwork for a possible gubernatorial campaign to take on the Sunshine State's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. In the 2020 election cycle, Demings was seen as a top contender on then-candidate Joe Biden's list of potential vice presidential picks.	Democratic Rep. Val Demings plans to launch a Senate challenge against Republican incumbent Marco Rubio next year, a national Democrat with knowledge of the party's strategy on Senate races told CNBC. Demings had previously confirmed she was looking at a bid for higher office in Florida. She had not discounted the possibility of challenging Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. Her decision to instead seek a Senate seat comes as Democrats look to defend their razor-thin majority in the chamber from Republicans eager to win back the congressional power they lost in the 2020 election. Politico , which first reported Demings' plans, said the Democrat still has a smidgen of room to change course but plans to make her final decision on the race as early as next month. In the 2020 election, Demings was seen as a top contender on then-candidate Joe Biden's list of potential vice presidential picks . Now a third-term member of Congress, the 64-year-old Demings was the first Black woman to serve as chief of police in Orlando. She also was an impeachment manager in the first Senate trial of former President Donald Trump . "Val is an impressive and formidable candidate whose potential entrance would make the race against Rubio highly competitive," the Democratic source said. Trump was acquitted in the GOP-held Senate on the articles of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Biden ultimately picked former California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate. Rubio, 49, has already announced he plans to seek a third term in the Senate in 2022 . Political analysts say his seat is likely to stay in Republican hands . A spokesman for Rubio did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Demings' plans. Florida, long a crucial battleground in presidential elections, has in recent years become a Republican stronghold. The state now has two Republican senators and a Republican governor, and it went for Trump over Biden in 2020. Earlier this month, DeSantis signed into law a sweeping election bill that critics says will suppress voter turnout and disproportionately affect certain demographics. A spokesman for Rubio's campaign, without mentioning Demings, told CNBC that Democrats "are tripping over themselves in a race to the left" as they search for a candidate. "Senator Rubio's record of results for Florida is unmatched, from passing the bipartisan PPP program that saved millions of Florida jobs to providing critical tax relief for hard working families," the spokesman said.
President Joe Biden is scheduled to tour Ford's new Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, where the electric F-150 Lightning pickup will be produced. Biden is expected to tout his American EV agenda and $2 trillion infrastructure package that includes $174 billion to spur the development and adoption of electric vehicles. The F-150 Lightning could be the poster child for such plans.	DETROIT — President Joe Biden is expected to use a visit Tuesday to a Ford Motor plant in Michigan to tout his agenda for American-made electric vehicles and his $2 trillion infrastructure package that includes $174 billion to spur the development and adoption of electric vehicles. Biden will tour Ford's new Rouge Electric Vehicle Center near the company's headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, where the electric F-150 Lightning pickup will be produced. He's expected to see the vehicle and receive a technical briefing of the truck ahead of its public unveiling Wednesday. The F-150 Lightning , which Ford is touting as an inflection point for the company, is expected to go on sale by mid-2022. An EV version of the best-selling truck in the U.S. could help Biden push his EV agenda, which is expected to include consumer incentives to spur adoption of the vehicles. "The fact that he's coming shows the commitment and the interest our government has in the electrification of the auto industry," Ford Chairman Bill Ford said last week at the automaker's annual shareholders meeting. "The fact that we're taking America's favorite vehicle and we're electrifying it really is a huge exclamation point. That hasn't been lost on anyone, including the president of the United States." Reuters, citing an unpublished White House fact sheet, reported Tuesday that Biden is expected to disclose more details of his plans to spur EV adoption during the visit. He's expected to rule out consumer incentives for high-priced electric luxury models while pushing for incentives for mainstream vehicles as well as manufacturers that use good labor practices. The F-150 Lightning could be the poster child for such plans. It will be union-made, unlike the Tesla Cybertruck, and it's expected to appeal more to mainstream Americans than General Motors ' upcoming $110,000 GMC Hummer EV pickup. GM, however, has plans to produce a more mainstream electric version of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup. Pickups are viewed as an important way to increase consumer adoption of EVs because they're the best-selling vehicles in the country. They're also extremely important to fleet and commercial customers, expected to be among the largest purchasers of EVs. "The F-150 is 1 out of every 10 vehicles made in the U.S. If we're going to move to an electric future, then it's going to have to involve vehicles like this," said Kristin Dziczek, senior vice president of research at the Center for Automotive Research. Biden has expressed interest in replacing the government's massive fleet of cars and trucks with EVs assembled in the U.S. In 2019, the U.S. government had 645,000 vehicles that were driven 4.5 billion miles and consumed 375 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel, according to the General Services Administration. Ford's F-Series pickups have been the best-selling truck in the U.S. since the mid-1970s. The wildly popular truck has reigned supreme for 44 years, including 39 years as the best-selling vehicle overall in the U.S. The significance of the truck to Ford can't be overstated. F-Series, which includes the F-150 and large truck siblings, is the automaker's profit engine. It's why investors and politicians are closely watching Ford's unveiling this week of the F-150 Lightning. "It's their most important product," said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit. "This is a space that they've done incredibly well for more than 40 years, and they're not going to cede leadership on any element of it willingly." At $42 billion in revenue a year, F-Series is among the largest consumer products in the nation, according to a Ford-commissioned analysis last year by Boston Consulting Group. It ranks behind Apple's iPhone but ahead of Android OS devices, Disney and all major sporting leagues, according to the study. It also found F-Series supports about 500,000 U.S. jobs through production and sales, representing 13 to 14 jobs for every direct Ford employee working on the truck. It also contributes about $49 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product, according to the study.
The ads criticize American Airlines CEO Doug Parker for his high pay at time of layoffs and taxpayer bailouts for the industry. They target Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey over obesity in America. And they criticize Nike CEO John Donohoe over allegations of forced labor in China. The decision to weigh in on political issues is a fraught one for American CEOs, who generally prefer to avoid fights that could alienate a large chunk of customers.	A conservative group is launching an advertising campaign Tuesday designed to push back against what it sees as "woke capitalism," spending more than $1 million on ads targeting the CEOs of Coca-Cola , American Airlines and Nike . The ads are sharply critical of the CEOs on a range of issues ranging from childhood obesity to allegations of forced labor in China. Organizers say the campaign, which is being mounted by the conservative group Consumers' Research, is designed to change the thinking in corporate boards around the economic and political costs of getting involved in flashpoint issues such as voting rights. "Increasingly we're seeing companies taking their eye off the ball," said William Hild, executive director Consumers' Research. "Our focus is always on the consumer. And that's what it should be for these companies as well, but increasingly we're seeing them work to curry favor with woke politicians, rather than focusing on serving their consumers." The dark money group says it will not disclose who is financing the campaign, saying it respects donors' privacy. Consumers' Research says it will run the ads on CNBC, Fox Business and local stations in the cities where the companies are headquartered. There will also be an online component to the campaign. Replete with ominous video of the CEOS and casting them very much like opposition candidates in a political campaign, the ads target the company CEOs by name. The ads criticize American Airlines CEO Doug Parker for his high pay at time of layoffs and taxpayer bailouts for the industry. They target Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey over obesity in America. And they criticize Nike CEO John Donohoe over allegations of forced labor in China. Asked for comment on the new campaign, American Airlines referred CNBC to its statement in April on its involvement in the Texas voting rights dispute. "As a Texas-based business, we must stand up for the rights of our team members and customers who call Texas home, and honor the sacrifices made by generations of Americans to protect and expand the right to vote." Coca-Cola and Nike did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The decision to weigh in on political issues is a fraught one for American CEOs, who generally prefer to avoid fights that could alienate many customers. In a CEO survey out Tuesday, Fortune magazine's Alan Murray reports that chief executives are split "right down the middle" on the issue. Fifty percent of those surveyed agreed that "CEOs have a responsibility to speak out on important social and political issues and should continue to do so." But another 50 percent agreed with the statement that "CEOs have recently gotten too involved in commenting on social and political issues and need to pull back." Writes Murray: "More than 80% agree that 'everything possible should be done to make it easy for every citizen to vote.' But countering that belief is a strong desire to stay out of the partisan crossfire (and perhaps not be called 'woke' by the editors of the Wall Street Journal .)" 
Democrats are moving to pass a bipartisan bill to set up a commission to study the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, but neither top Republican in Congress has backed the plan. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he would oppose the plan, while Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said his caucus is "undecided" about whether to set up a panel. The Republican leaders' stances raises questions about the legislation's passage in Congress. McCarthy contended the panel would duplicate existing investigations and argued it should have a broader scope.	Democrats will move this week to pass a bipartisan bill to form a commission to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, but the top Republicans in Congress have not yet backed the plan, raising questions about its passage. The House plans to vote as soon as Wednesday on legislation to set up a 10-member panel — appointed by Democratic and Republican leaders — which would study the events that led to a pro-Trump mob overrunning the Capitol while lawmakers confirmed President Joe Biden's electoral win. Reps. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and John Katko, R-N.Y., the chair and ranking members of the House Homeland Security Committee, brokered the agreement. Despite GOP involvement in reaching the deal, neither House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif., or Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., have yet come on board with the proposal. Democrats can pass the bill in the House with little or no GOP support, but they will need 10 Republican votes to overcome a filibuster in the Senate. McCarthy, who voted to object to counting Arizona and Pennsylvania's certified election results after rioters stormed the Capitol, said he would oppose the legislation. He contended the panel would duplicate efforts by congressional committees and federal authorities to investigate the insurrection, and argued its scope should extend beyond the events of Jan. 6. "Given the political misdirections that have marred this process, given the now duplicative and potentially counterproductive nature of this effort, and given the Speaker's shortsighted scope that does not examine interrelated forms of political violence in America, I cannot support this legislation," he said in a statement Tuesday. McConnell, meanwhile, said Senate Republicans are "undecided about the way forward at this point" and would "read the fine print" before Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., brings the bill to a vote. He expressed concerns about Democratic influence over staff hiring and potential overlap with prosecution of rioters. Schumer committed Tuesday to bringing the legislation to a vote if the House passes it. "Republicans can let their constituents know, are they on the side of truth or do they want to cover up for the insurrectionists and for Donald Trump?" he told reporters. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, reacting to McCarthy's opposition, said, "I am very pleased that we have a bipartisan bill to come to the floor, and [it's] disappointing but not surprising that [there is] cowardice on the part of some on the Republican side, [to] not to want to find the truth." Some GOP senators have echoed McCarthy's concerns about the commission. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican who also objected to counting certified election results, said Monday that a commission should probe other events including when a driver rammed into a barricade and killed Capitol Police officer William Evans on Good Friday. Rioters, spurred by former President Donald Trump's unfounded claims that Biden won because of widespread fraud, overran the Capitol on Jan. 6 in events that led to five deaths, including that of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick. The mob, which included people chanting "Hang Mike Pence," came within moments of reaching the former vice president and members of Congress. The attack on the legislature led the House to impeach Trump for inciting an insurrection during his final days in office. The Senate acquitted him after Biden's inauguration as many Republicans argued they could not convict a former president. Dozens of challenges in key states failed to uncover evidence of irregularities that would have cost Trump the 2020 election. House Republicans have increasingly ostracized members who challenge the election conspiracy theories spread by the former president, who maintains a strong hold on GOP voters. The caucus on Wednesday removed Rep. Liz Cheney , a Wyoming Republican and one of 10 members of her party to vote to impeach Trump, from her leadership post. Cheney later said "we cannot be dragged backward by the very dangerous lies of a former president." She has expressed strong support for a commission to investigate the insurrection.

The U.S. military has completed up to 20% of its withdrawal process from Afghanistan, as America makes an exit from its longest war. In April, Biden announced a full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Monday that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas will not curb the Biden administration's ambition to complete a full withdrawal from Afghanistan.	WASHINGTON – Since President Joe Biden 's decision to pull troops from Afghanistan, the U.S. has completed up to 20% of the process of withdrawing from the country, the U.S. Central Command said Tuesday. The Biden administration said Monday that the conflict between Israel and Hamas would not stall that effort. The command has overseen the removal of approximately 115 loads of equipment on C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft. More than 5,000 pieces of equipment, which will not be left to the Afghan military, have also been handed over to the Defense Logistics Agency for destruction. The U.S. has also officially handed over five facilities to the Afghan military. Central Command estimates that the U.S. has so far completed between 13% and 20% of the withdrawal process. In April, Biden announced a full withdrawal o f U.S. troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, ending America's longest war. The removal of approximately 3,000 U.S. service members coincides with the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which spurred America's entry into lengthy wars in the Middle East and Central Asia. Biden's withdrawal timeline breaks with a proposed deadline brokered last year by the Trump administration and the Taliban . All foreign forces would have had to leave Afghanistan by May 1 under that deal. Last month, the White House confirmed that U.S. troops had begun the withdrawal process from Afghanistan. The Pentagon proactively deployed additional troops and military equipment to protect forces in the region, the administration said. Central Command has not revealed the number of troops currently stationed there due to operational security measures. On Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki downplayed concerns that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas would curb the Biden administration's ambition to complete a full withdrawal from Afghanistan. When asked if troops would remain in the region to potentially assist in peacekeeping missions, as the violence intensifies, Psaki told reporters that the administration did not expect to miss its withdrawal deadline. "I've not been made aware of any concern of the overlapping of an impact on our Afghan withdrawal plans," Psaki said. Biden in a Monday afternoon call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised concerns over the mounting civilian death toll and expressed his support for a cease-fire. Violence between Israel and Hamas militants has escalated for more than a week. Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip have led to at least 212 Palestinian deaths, according to authorities there. Meanwhile, Israel has said more than 3,400 rockets have bombarded its cities. At least 12 people have died in Israel. The violence has marked the biggest escalation in the conflict in years. On Tuesday the European Union became the latest to call for a cease-fire.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Tuesday called for a "diplomatic boycott" of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing in response to China's human rights record. Pelosi blasted corporate sponsors of the games who "look the other way on China's abuses out of concern for their bottom line." Activists and lawmakers of both parties have called on President Joe Biden to bow out of the 2022 Olympics in protest.	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Tuesday called for a "diplomatic boycott" of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing in response to China's human rights record. "We cannot proceed as if nothing is wrong about the Olympics going to China," Pelosi told Congress' Human Rights Commission  and the Congressional-Executive Commission on China during a hearing on the games. Pelosi suggested in her remarks that athletes should still be able to compete in the games but that world leaders and royalty should not travel to attend them in person. "For heads of state to go to China, in light of a genocide that is ongoing while you're sitting there in your seats, really begs the question: What moral authority do you have to speak about human rights any place in the world if you're willing to pay your respects to the Chinese government as they commit genocide?" Pelosi blasted corporate sponsors of the games who "look the other way on China's abuses out of concern for their bottom line." She specifically called out companies that reportedly lobbied to weaken parts of a bipartisan bill targeting the use of forced labor in the Xinjiang region. "If we don't speak out against human rights violations in China for commercial reasons, we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights anywhere," Pelosi said. China has called allegations that it violates the human rights of Muslims in Xinjiang "lies and disinformation." The games are set to open on Feb. 4, 2022. Pelosi acknowledged that her proposed diplomatic boycott may not work. "I don't know if it's possible, because we have not succeeded in the past," she said. In 2008, Pelosi called on then-President George W. Bush to boycott the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing in protest of China's human rights record, which at the time was marred primarily by the government's crackdown in Tibet. Bush attended the opening of those games, along with more than 80 other heads of state. Activists and lawmakers of both parties have called on President Joe Biden to bow out of the 2022 Olympics in protest. They cite China's reported treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang — which both the Trump and Biden administrations have called a genocide — as well as Beijing's response to protests in Hong Kong. The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has said it opposes boycotts, in part because they impact athletes who have spent years training to compete. The White House has previously left the door open for a boycott , but press secretary Jen Psaki said last month that such a move was not being discussed . "While China has changed over 30 years in some respects, it is appalling that its human rights record has worsened," Pelosi said in the virtual hearing Tuesday afternoon. Pelosi stressed that she is a dedicated Olympics fan and views athletes' performances in the games as a source of pride. "Let's honor them at home," Pelosi said. "Let's not honor the Chinese government by having heads of state go to China to show their support for their athletes." "Silence on this issue is unacceptable. It enables China's abuses," Pelosi said.
The House passed a bill that aims to curb a spike in hate crimes against Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic. It heads to President Joe Biden's desk, and he is expected to sign the measure into law. The legislation would instruct the Justice Department to expedite review of hate crimes related to Covid-19, and give local law enforcement more resources to track violence.	The House passed a bill Tuesday that aims to stem a spike in hate crimes against Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic . Approval in a 364-62 vote sends the measure to President Joe Biden 's desk for his signature. The bill passed the Senate last month with only one vote against it. The Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act would direct the Justice Department to expedite review of hate crimes related to the pandemic. Amid challenges in documenting violence and harassment against Asian Americans, the measure also seeks to give local law enforcement more resources to track the incidents. The measure also aims to provide guidance on how to reduce discriminatory language tied to Covid-19. Rep. Grace Meng, a New York Democrat and co-author of the bill, said "the past year and a half has been one of pain and struggle, marked by despicable and sickening acts of hate and violence against the Asian American community." "The Asian American community is exhausted from being forced to endure this rise in bigotry and racist attacks. Asian Americans are tired of living in fear and being frightened about their kids or elderly parents going outside," she told reporters Tuesday. "People often ask what Congress is doing about this, and we are here today to say that Congress is taking action." Biden has supported the bill and plans to sign it. Last month, the Office of Management and Budget said the measure would "stand up for America's values by standing strongly against anti-Asian xenophobia and hate." Racist comments about the virus's origins in China have led to scapegoating and violence against Asian Americans in the roughly 14 months since the pandemic started. Former President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress contributed to the wave of incendiary rhetoric about China when Covid-19 first reached the U.S. Hate crimes against Asian Americans reported to police spiked by 164% in 16 of the largest U.S. cities during the first quarter of 2021 compared with the previous year, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Some activist groups have questioned how effective the hate crimes bill will be in rooting out the causes of violence against Asian Americans, according to NBC News. The organizations in part raised concerns that better reporting of hate crimes would not do enough to prevent violence. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
Texas became the largest state Wednesday with a law that bans abortions before many women even know they are pregnant. The law comes with a unique provision that essentially leaves enforcement to private citizens through lawsuits against doctors or anyone who helps a woman get an abortion.	Texas became the largest state Wednesday with a law that bans abortions before many women even know they are pregnant, but with a unique provision that essentially leaves enforcement to private citizens through lawsuits against doctors or anyone who helps a woman get an abortion. The law signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott puts Texas in line with more than a dozen other states that ban abortions after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, as early as six weeks. Federal courts have mostly blocked the measures from taking effect. But with the Supreme Court this week agreeing to take up a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, abortion rights activists worry that a ruling favorable to the state could lay the groundwork for allowing even more abortion restrictions, including so-called heartbeat bills. Texas' version is unique in that it prohibits state officials from enforcing the ban. Instead, it allows anyone — even someone outside Texas — to sue an abortion provider or anyone else who may have helped someone get an abortion after the limit, and seek financial damages of up to $10,000 per defendant. Critics say that provision would allow abortion opponents to flood the courts with lawsuits to harass doctors, patients, nurses, domestic violence counselors, a friend who drove a woman to a clinic, or even a parent who paid for a procedure. Texas law currently bans abortion after 20 weeks, with exceptions for a woman with a life-threatening medical condition or if the fetus has a severe abnormality. More than 90% of abortions take place in the first 13 weeks of a woman's pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Supreme Court will probably hear the Mississippi case in the fall, with a decision likely in spring 2022.
The United States was imposing new sanctions on Russian companies and ships Wednesday for their work completing a European natural gas pipeline long opposed by the U.S. The U.S. will waive any similar penalties against the German company running the Nord Stream 2 AG project and its German CEO. The U.S. has long opposed the project, which would bring natural gas from Russia to Germany.	The United States was imposing new sanctions on Russian companies and ships Wednesday for their work completing a European natural gas pipeline long opposed by the U.S. but will waive any similar penalties against the German company running the Nord Stream 2 AG project and its German CEO, according to two congressional aides and the German government. The decision to spare the German company comes as President Joe Biden looks to mend relations with a key ally that were unsettled during the Trump administration. But the decision angered U.S, lawmakers and other critics of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline who hoped to stop the project by targeting the company and its top executive. The U.S. has long opposed the project, which would bring natural gas from Russia to Germany. It argues the pipeline threatens European energy security and poses risks to Ukraine and Poland, which are both bypassed by the project. "I've made it clear to the Biden administration from day one that every effort should be made to prevent completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline," Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat and a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Shaheen said she was disappointed with the administration's decision to spare the German company. "Completion of this pipeline poses a threat to U.S. security interests and the stability of our partners in the region," Shaheen said in a statement. The Biden administration said its opposition to the pipeline, which Russia is racing to finish, remains. "The Biden administration has been clear that Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a bad deal; it's a Russian geopolitical project that threatens European energy security," White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. The administration was expected to announce the measures later Wednesday as Secretary of State Antony Blinken sits down in Iceland for his first face-to-face meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Their meeting was already expected to be contentions amid a sharp deterioration in ties between Washington and Moscow. Congressional aides said the administration would impose sanctions on eight Russian ships and companies involved. The German company, Nord Stream 2 AG, and its German chief executive will also be identified as violating U.S. law. But Biden is using presidential authority to waive sanctions on them under a national interest exemption in the legislation, according to the aides and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. The aides spoke on condition of anonymity because the administration has yet to transmit a periodic compliance report to Congress that will identify the targets of the sanctions. Maas, who spoke with Blinken by phone about the issue on Tuesday, praised the decision. "We perceive this to be a constructive step that we will gladly continue to discuss with our partners in Washington," Maas told reporters in Berlin on Wednesday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has defended the project, noting that Russian gas already flows freely into Europe along other routes, including the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline under the Baltic Sea to Germany. Nord Stream 2 is owned by Russian state company Gazprom, with investment from several European companies. Domestic critics in Germany have argued the pipeline should be abandoned because of Russia's treatment of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. Maas said Germany would discuss with U.S. officials what further steps are necessary to ensure that the waiver remains in place when the next report is due in three months. "We understand the decision that was made in Washington to be one that takes into consideration the really extraordinarily good relations that have been established with the Biden administration," he said. "And we naturally also understand it to indicate that Germany (is seen as) an important partner for the United States on which one counts in the future." In choosing not to hit Germany with sanctions and focus on Russian companies, the administration has exacerbated a battle with lawmakers, some of whom have now placed holds on the nominations of several of the administration's picks for senior State Department positions and are threatening to block others. Nord Stream 2 has attracted bipartisan opposition on Capitol Hill, with administration critics such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, joining Democrats such as New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, and New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. In Germany, the two leading contenders to succeed Merkel after the country's Sept. 26 general election have contrasting positions on the pipeline. The project is 95% complete although construction has not yet begun on its final leg in German waters. The candidate of the environmentalist Greens party, Annalena Baerbock, said recently that she would have withdrawn support for Nord Stream 2. Armin Laschet, the candidate of Merkel's center-right party, backs Germany's existing stance. "I think the German government's position is right, that it has granted the project all its permits," Laschet said Wednesday at a discussion event on foreign policy. "'It can't happen' isn't a foreign policy response, because it is happening," he said.
New York State Attorney General Letitia James' office, which already was conducting a civil investigation of former President Donald Trump's company, is now probing the Trump Organization "in a criminal capacity," her spokesman said. James' spokesman indicated that her office's probe is being conducted in conjunction with the criminal investigation of Trump and the Trump Organization by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. Both investigations are eyeing claims by Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen that the Trump Organization misstated real estate valuations to reduce their tax liabilities, and get better loan and insurance terms.	New York State Attorney General Letitia James' office — which already was conducting a civil investigation of former President Donald Trump 's company — is now also probing the Trump Organization "in a criminal capacity" as well, her spokesman said Tuesday night. James' spokesman implied that her probe is being done in conjunction with the criminal investigation of Trump and the Trump Organization by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. The 2-year-old civil investigation by the Democrat James already was eyeing allegations that the Trump Organization had manipulated the stated value of real estate assets in order to lower their tax liability and to receive more favorable terms for loans and insurance. Vance's office has been conducting a criminal investigation of those allegations , which first were made in congressional testimony by Trump's former longtime attorney Michael Cohen . Vance's probe also is focused on other issues. "We have informed the Trump Organization that our investigation into the organization is no longer purely civil in nature," said James' spokesman, Fabien Levy. "We are now actively investigating the Trump Organization in a criminal capacity, along with the Manhattan DA. We have no additional comment at this time," Levy said. An official familiar with the latest developments told WNBC in New York on Wednesday that James' office is not conducting a separate criminal probe, but instead has sent two lawyers from her office to work with Vance's investigators. The move came after James' investigators found evidence suggesting a possible crime, that official said. In late 2019, James scored a legal victory against Trump when a judge ordered him to pay $2 million to settle a lawsuit by the attorney general's office alleging that he had misused his Trump Foundation, a charity, to benefit his 2016 presidential campaign, along with other unlawful activity for more than a decade. The Trump Foundation agreed in December 2018 to dissolve and to donate its remaining funds to charity as the AG's probe into the foundation continued. A Trump Organization spokeswoman declined to comment on the announcement that the current probe by James now is focused on possible crimes. But Trump, in a statement issued Wednesday, said, "There is nothing more corrupt than an investigation that is in desperate search of a crime." "But, make no mistake, that is exactly what is happening here," Trump said. The former president then cited statements James made while campaigning in 2018 for election as attorney general. "The Attorney General of New York literally campaigned on prosecuting Donald Trump even before she knew anything about me," Trump said. "She said that if elected, she would use her office to look into 'every aspect' of my real estate dealings. She swore that she would 'definitely sue' me. She boasted on video that she would be, and I quote, 'a real pain in the ass.' " "She declared, 'just wait until I'm in the Attorney General's office,' and, 'I've got my eyes on Trump Tower,' " Trump said. "She also promised that, if elected, she would 'join with law enforcement and other Attorney Generals across this nation in removing this President from office,' and, 'It's important that everyone understand that the days of Donald Trump are coming to an end.' " James won her election in 2018 with 62% of the vote, crushing Republican nominee Keith Wofford. Last November, Trump, who was raised in the Queens section of New York City, received just 37.7% of the vote in the presidential election in New York State, whose 29 Electoral College votes helped give President Joe Biden his margin of victory over the Republican incumbent. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., later Wednesday later tweeted a copy of his father's full statement on the investigation, which the son called "the flagrant witch hunt that started before New York's Attorney General even took office and apparently before she'd actually seen any actual evidence. (Apparently minor details these days)." "If that's not a political persecution I'm not sure what is," the younger Trump tweeted. James last August filed an ultimately successful court action that forced Trump's other adult son, Eric Trump, to answer questions as part of her investigation. Eric Trump runs the Trump Organization with Donald Trump Jr. The AG's investigators also have reportedly taken a deposition from Allen Weisselberg, the long-time chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. Vance's probe recently has looked into Weisselberg and his two adult sons, one of whom works for the Trump Organization. Among the real estate holdings that James is known to be eyeing is Seven Springs Estate, a 212-acre property in Westchester County. The Trump Organization used valuations of Seven Springs to claim an apparent tax deduction of more than $21 million by donating a conservation easement on the property in 2015. In 2019, the Financial Times newspaper noted that Trump purchased Seven Springs for $7.5 million in 1996, but valued it at more than $290 million in 2012. Forbes magazine in 2014 said the property was worth less than $19.5 million, citing what were then recent property sales, as well as local real estate brokers and assessors. James' office also is investigating the valuations of the Trump building at 40 Wall St. in Manhattan, the Trump International Hotel and Tower Chicago, and the  Trump National Golf Club – Los Angeles. In a statement issued in August, James said, "Nothing will stop us from following the facts and the law, wherever they may lead." James at the time accused the Trump Organization of stalling in requests for information, withholding documents, and instructing witnesses, among them Eric Trump, "to refuse to answer questions under oath." In February, the U.S. Supreme Court refused a last-ditch request by the former president to block Vance's investigators from obtaining years' worth of his tax returns and other financial records via a grand jury subpoena from his long-time accountants.
The House passed a bill Wednesday to create a commission to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The chamber approved the measure with bipartisan support, even as House Republican leaders urged their caucus to oppose it. The bill's passage in the Senate is unclear, as Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would oppose it. The 10-member panel would probe what led to the attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power, and issue a report after it finishes the investigation.	The House passed a bipartisan bill Wednesday to create an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol as the chamber's GOP leaders lobbied against its passage. The plan would set up a panel to probe the attack on the legislature by a mob of Trump supporters, which led to the deaths of five people, including a Capitol Police officer. Democratic and Republican leaders would each appoint five people to the 10-member commission, which would issue a report after it finishes its investigation. The panel would have subpoena power. The Democratic-held House passed the measure with GOP support in a 252-175 vote, as lawmakers seek more information on what led to the violent attempt to disrupt the transfer of power to President Joe Biden . House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif., opposed the plan and his leadership team formally urged Republicans to vote against it. Thirty-five GOP representatives supported the measure, while 175 Republicans voted opposed it. The bill will have a harder time getting through the Senate. While Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., plans to bring it to a vote, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., announced his opposition to it Wednesday. Democrats would need only 10 GOP votes to approve the measure in the Senate, but McConnell's stance deals a blow to its prospects. "It's not at all clear what new facts or additional investigation yet another commission could actually lay on top of existing efforts by law enforcement and Congress," McConnell said. "The facts have come out and they'll continue to come out." Ahead of the House vote Wednesday, Schumer said the chamber's Republican leaders "are caving to Donald Trump and proving that the Republican Party is still drunk off the big lie." A mob of supporters of former President Donald Trump , fueled by his unfounded claims that widespread fraud propelled Biden's 2020 election win, overran the Capitol while lawmakers formally counted the president's victory. The rioters came within moments of reaching members of Congress and former Vice President Mike Pence — who rejected Trump's pressure to use his ceremonial role in the process to help to overturn the election result, prompting chants of "Hang Mike Pence!" House Democrats, joined by 10 Republicans, impeached Trump for inciting an insurrection during his final days in office. The Senate acquitted the former president after he left the White House. All 50 members of the Democratic caucus and seven Republicans voted to convict him. Republican criticism of the commission deal comes as much of the party tries to downplay the attempts to disrupt the transfer of power or compare them to other political violence or property damage. House Republicans in particular have aimed to curb criticism of Trump — the most popular figure in their party — as they try to win back control of the chamber in the midterm elections next year. In statement announcing his opposition to the commission deal Tuesday, McCarthy contended the panel should have a broader scope. He also said he worried it could duplicate investigative efforts by congressional committees and the Justice Department. "Given the political misdirections that have marred this process, given the now duplicative and potentially counterproductive nature of this effort, and given the Speaker's shortsighted scope that does not examine interrelated forms of political violence in America, I cannot support this legislation," McCarthy, who voted to object to counting Arizona and Pennsylvania's certified 2020 election results, said. Ahead of the vote Wednesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., lambasted Republicans for likening an armed disruption of the transfer of power to other violence. He said the GOP appeared to be trying to "confuse the issue enough that we'll lose sight of the insurrection on Jan. 6." Hoyer added that he did not know of "any other instance that is analogous" to the attack on the Capitol during his roughly four decades in Congress. The concerns from Republicans come after a lawmaker from both parties, Homeland Security Committee Chair Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and ranking member Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., brokered the agreement. Katko responded Wednesday to concerns from within his party about Democrats using the panel for political means. "I ask my colleagues to consider the fact that this commission is built to work, and it will be depoliticized, and it will get the results we need," he said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has also criticized GOP lawmakers for opposing the commission agreement. In comments to NBC News, she said she saw "cowardice on the part of some on the Republican side," who do not "want to find the truth." Before the vote Wednesday, she called the commission critical to understanding the attack on the Capitol. "This legislation is about something larger even than the commission, vital as the commission is. This legislation is about our democracy," Pelosi said. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
House Republicans introduced a 5-year, $400 billion transportation bill that directs historic levels of funding to highways, bridges and transit systems. The reauthorization bill comes as the White House and Senate Republicans are negotiating a bigger, standalone infrastructure package. The House GOP plan excludes several kinds of infrastructure that the plans of both the Democrats and the Senate Republicans address, such as rural broadband, mass transit and airports.	WASHINGTON — House Republicans introduced a 5-year, $400 billion transportation bill on Wednesday that directs historic levels of funding to highways, bridges and transit systems. The bill comes amid ongoing talks this week between the White House and Senate Republicans over their competing infrastructure plans. The bill unveiled on Wednesday represents a potential third option for infrastructure funding, one that's more narrowly focused than either the White House plan or the Senate Republicans' plan. "Our bill focuses on the core infrastructure that helps move people and goods through our communities every single day, cuts red tape that holds up project construction, and gets resources into the hands of our states and locals with as few strings attached as possible," said Rep. Sam Graves, of Missouri, the ranking member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and a lead sponsor of the bill. Unlike the proposals currently on the table from the White House and Senate Republicans, Graves' bill is not a piece of standalone legislation. Rather it is a reauthorization of the current five-year transportation funding bill, which expires on Sept. 30. Graves' legislation, known as the Surface Transportation Advanced through Reform, Technology & Efficient Review Act, or STARTER Act, would increase the money for surface transportation projects by a third, or about $100 billion. But it would not address several other elements of infrastructure that the standalone plans of both the Democrats and the Senate Republicans address, such as broadband, mass transit, water projects and airports. Beyond those, Biden's plan would also include billions more to fund research and development, schools and electric-vehicle charging stations. The House Republicans' plan also proposes spending much less than Biden's proposal, the $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan, or the Senate Republicans' counteroffer, which comes in at around $570 billion. "As the process for considering legislation on infrastructure moves forward, I am eager to see these proposals become part of a robust bipartisan effort — just as the President continues to call for," said Graves. Biden has said he wants to reach a compromise agreement with Republicans on infrastructure. To do that, he appears to be willing to bundle the "hard infrastructure" elements of his American Jobs Plan into a separate bill if that means it could pass with bipartisan support. But Republicans have balked at Biden's infrastructure plan, decrying both its price tag and the proposed increase in the corporate tax rate that Biden would use to pay for it. The GOP counteroffer plan would be limited to hard infrastructure, and it would be paid for using a mix of user fees, repurposed coronavirus relief funds and public-private partnerships. Following a meeting last week with Biden, a small group of Republican senators met on Tuesday with White House negotiators to continue working on a bipartisan infrastructure deal. A White House spokesperson later said Biden's team was "encouraged" by the talks, and the White House would follow up with the senators later this week. Republicans also said the closed-door meeting was productive. "We talked about the ways that you can get into some non-traditional sources of revenue," said Sen. Roy Blunt, of Missouri, who participated in the talks. "How you do things like public-private partnerships, maybe some [vehicle] miles traveled and some sort of vehicle charge on electric vehicles." The question of how to incorporate electric vehicles into traditional infrastructure funding emerged this week as an unexpected sticking point in the talks. Republicans insist that any bipartisan bill include a tax or a fee on electric-vehicle drivers, who do not pay the gas taxes that fund the federal Highway Trust Fund. Democrats, however, insist that any final bill also include money to install hundreds of thousands of new charging stations for electric vehicles across the country. Biden spent the day Tuesday in Michigan at a Ford Motors plant that manufactures electric vehicles, a day before Ford officially released its first fully electric F-150 pickup truck. The rollout marked a milestone in the push to make electric vehicles more appealing to U.S. consumers, who typically favor bigger cars than buyers in Europe and Asia do. Biden used the trip to tout the American Jobs Plan. "The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America," he said. "And we need automakers and other companies to keep investing here in America and not take the benefits of our public investments and expand electric vehicles and battery manufacturing production abroad."
President Joe Biden in a Wednesday morning call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he expected "a significant de-escalation today" in Gaza. Netanyahu, shortly after speaking with Biden, said he is "determined to continue in this operation until its objective is achieved." Late Wednesday afternoon Lebanese security officials reported several rockets fired from southern Lebanon into Israel.	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday said he was determined to continue the bombardment of Gaza, after U.S. President Joe Biden called for a "significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire" during a phone call between the two leaders. Netanyahu, shortly after speaking with Biden, said he is "determined to continue in this operation until its objective is achieved -- to bring back the quiet and security to…citizens of Israel," according to The Jerusalem Post and other Israeli media outlets. The worst outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian violence since 2014 has entered its second week as militants in the blockaded Gaza Strip continue their rocket fire. Hostilities have spilled out into Jerusalem, the West Bank and Israel, as Palestinian protesters striking in solidarity with Gazans clash with Israeli police, some of the protesters throwing rocks while police respond with tear gas. Many of the demonstrators do not support Hamas, but see the protests as acts of resistance against Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. Late Wednesday afternoon Lebanese security officials reported several rockets fired from southern Lebanon into Israel. Israel's military said air raid sirens were triggered in northern Israel and that one of the four rockets fired into the country was intercepted by its Iron Dome missile defense system. "In response, IDF artillery forces are striking a number of targets in Lebanon," the Israel Defense Forces said on their Twitter account. Airstrikes from Israeli fighter jets killed six people in Gaza on Wednesday and leveled an extended family house in the territory that was home to 40 people. Members of the family say a warning missile fired five minutes before the bombing enabled everyone in the house to escape with their lives. The Palestinian death toll in Gaza rose to 227 including at least 64 children as of Wednesday, according to health officials there. At least 17 Palestinians have also been killed in the West Bank since Friday. The death toll in Israel currently stands at 12, including two children. Two Thai workers in southern Israel were killed in a rocket attack fired from Gaza on Tuesday. Israel says more than 3,400 rockets have bombarded its cities and towns. The IDF said it plans to expand its bombing of Hamas' tunnel networks, many of which run under Gaza's civilian areas. Already several homes have been destroyed by the bombings, with Palestinian families buried under the rubble. Netanyahu said Tuesday that the operations show "there is a price" for Hamas' aggression against Israel. Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus on Tuesday described the tunnels as the "backbone" of Hamas' operations, saying that the campaign to obliterate the subterranean network "will be expanded" in the coming days. Hamas — the U.S.-designated terrorist group spearheading the rocket attacks on Israel — also governs the Gaza Strip, a 140-square mile piece of land housing 2 million people that has been under Israeli blockade since 2007. International calls for cessation of the violence have meanwhile grown. Biden in a Wednesday morning call with Netanyahu said he expected "a significant de-escalation today on the path to a cease-fire." It was the fourth call between the two heads of state since the violence erupted. Meanwhile, France, Egypt and Jordan all pushed for an immediate cease-fire and unhindered access to humanitarian aid in the beleaguered Gaza Strip. "The three leaders (of France, Egypt and Jordan) emphasized the urgency of addressing the root causes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by resuming effective negotiations to achieve a just and lasting peace," a joint statement said Wednesday. "The three leaders emphasized that the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the basis of the two-state solution remains indispensable for a comprehensive peace in the region." Members of the U.N. Security Council have meanwhile pushed for resolutions calling for cease-fires, all of which the U.S. have so far blocked, reportedly because the texts did not mention Hamas' rocket attacks as part of the problem. The latest U.S. rejection of a resolution was late Tuesday night, leaving the Security Council with no joint statement as bombs and rockets continued to fly. There may be a sign of progress, however; late Tuesday night, Israel media reported that diplomatic efforts involving Egypt and the U.S. could produce a cease-fire in the next two to three days. Egypt holds significant clout as it brokered the truce that ended the last Gaza war in 2014, and is the only country with lines of communication to both Israel and Hamas. The government of Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has already opened communication with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and sent mediators to Jerusalem, and has opened its border to Gaza — the only land border connecting the blockaded enclave to the rest of the world — to allow injured Gazans access to Egyptian hospitals. International pressure, however, may be fruitless as long as Hamas and Israel have incentives to continue attacking one another. Even left-wing Jewish members of Israel's parliament who support Palestinian statehood have not called for an end to the Israeli military offensive, given that Hamas' rockets are still being launched at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The U.S. administration continues to reiterate Israel's "right to defend itself." Washington is Israel's top arms dealer, and provides it with $3.8 billion in military aid annually. Israeli media reported this week that House Democrats will demand a halt to a planned sale by the Biden administration of precision-guided missiles to Israel. The administration earlier in May notified Congress of an intended sale of $735 million of the weapons to Israel, Reuters reported at the time. --
President Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday he expects "a significant de-escalation today on the path to a cease-fire." It was their fourth conversation since the violence erupted between Israel and Hamas nine days earlier, the worst fighting between the two sides since 2014. Netanyahu said he is "determined to continue this operation until its objective is achieved" after speaking with Biden. More than 130 Democratic members of the U.S. House signed a letter calling for Biden to "facilitate the immediate cessation of violence."	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a phone call Wednesday that he expects "a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire," the White House said. It was their fourth conversation since the violence erupted between Israel and Hamas nine days earlier . Israel's strikes on the Gaza Strip have led to at least 227 Palestinian deaths including 64 children and 38 women, according to authorities there. Israel has said more than 3,400 rockets have bombarded its cities and towns. At least 12 people have died in Israel. "The President conveyed to the Prime Minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire," according to the White House readout of the call. In a statement after speaking with Biden, Netanyahu said he is "determined to continue in this operation until its objective is achieved — to bring back the quiet and security to…citizens of Israel," according to The Jerusalem Post and other Israeli media outlets. The latest round of fighting has marked the worst outbreak of violence since the war between Israel and Hamas in 2014. Biden faces growing pressure from his own party to do more to end the violence. More than 130 Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday signed a letter "strenuously" urging the president to "boldly lead and take decisive action to end the violence" by pressing both sides to negotiate a cease-fire. "Too many people have already died. More will unnecessarily perish if America does not act with the immediacy this violence demands," according to the letter signed by House Democrats. In Tel Aviv, Netanyahu briefed foreign diplomats and ambassadors on the worsening violence and reiterated previous claims that the Israeli military tries " to target those who target us with great precision ." "There is no army in the world that does more than the Israeli army, in the Israeli security services, in Israeli intelligence to prevent collateral damage," Netanyahu said. Netanyahu added that Hamas "is embedded deeply in civilian areas" in order to use civilians as human shields. Diplomatic representatives from the U.S., European Union and ambassadors from Russia, China, India, Germany, Austria, Australia, Japan, Brazil, Canada and Italy attended the briefing, according to Israel's Foreign Ministry. The dramatic escalation of tensions followed protests over the potential eviction of Palestinian families from a neighborhood in east Jerusalem by Israel's Supreme Court. In Jerusalem on May 7, Israeli security forces clashed with stone-throwing Palestinians near Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site in advance of a court hearing three days later in the eviction case. With tensions rising, the high court delayed the hearing in the case brought by right-wing Israelis. "We have had over 60 calls, from the president on down, with senior leaders in Israel, the Palestinian Authority and other leaders in the region," White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One. "The president has done this for a long time, for decades, he believes this is the approach we need to be taking. He wants to make sure we end the violence and the suffering we have seen for the Palestinian and Israeli people," Jean-Pierre added. When pressed for more details of the call, Jean-Pierre said she would let the formal readout "speak for itself." Biden told Netanyahu earlier in the week that the U.S. supported a cease-fire amid a call from 28 Democratic senators for an immediate end to the violence. "The President reiterated his firm support for Israel's right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket attacks. The President welcomed efforts to address intercommunal violence and to bring calm to Jerusalem," according to a White House readout of that call. Biden also called on Israel to ensure the protection of innocent civilians amid the conflict. On Sunday, Israel conducted a strike that leveled several homes in the Gaza Strip. The strike, the deadliest yet in the ongoing conflict, killed at least 42 people. Netanyahu defended a punishing airstrike Saturday that collapsed a 12-story building housing international media, alleging Hamas was using a portion of the building to plan terror attacks.
The Biden administration said it will continue to enforce coronavirus-related restrictions on nonessential travel across U.S. land borders through June 21. Essential trade and travel will still be permitted, the Department of Homeland Security said in a tweet. The administration's decision to keep the restrictions in place for another month was announced amid a decline in Covid infections and deaths in the U.S.	The U.S. will continue to enforce coronavirus-related restrictions on nonessential travel across U.S. land borders through June 21, the Biden administration announced on Thursday. "We're working closely with Canada & Mexico to safely ease restrictions as conditions improve," the Department of Homeland Security said on Twitter. Essential trade and travel will still be permitted, the DHS tweeted. It was unclear from the DHS tweet if the agency anticipated easing those restrictions immediately after June 21, or if it would merely reassess the need for those limits at that time. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for clarification. DHS initially put cross-border travel restrictions in place on April 20, 2020 , under then-President Donald Trump , more than a month after the World Health Organization declared the virus had grown into a pandemic . The administration's decision to keep the restrictions in place for another month was announced amid a decline in Covid infections and deaths in the U.S. , which has administered more than 277 million vaccine doses, with 47% of the population having received at least one injection so far. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week changed its guidance on masks , telling Americans that they no longer needed to wear preventive face coverings in most settings once they have been fully vaccinated. But President Joe Biden and his health officials still warn that the nation has not yet rid itself of the pandemic, especially as highly transmissible Covid variants that are proliferating in other countries show up in the U.S.
The House passed a $1.9 billion supplemental security funding bill in response to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. It faces an uncertain path in the Senate, as Republicans question the need for additional legislation to respond to the attack on the Capitol. Passage of the bill follows House approval of a measure that would set up an independent commission to investigate what led to the insurrection.	The House passed a $1.9 billion U.S. Capitol security bill Thursday as Congress splinters over how to protect lives and the democratic process after the Jan. 6 insurrection. The Democratic-held chamber approved the measure by the thinnest of margins a day after it passed a bill to set up an independent commission to investigate the attack on the legislature. Opposition from Republican leaders has raised doubts about whether either proposal can get through the evenly split Senate. The House cleared the security funding in a 213-212 vote, while three representatives voted "present." The three Democrats who opposed the bill and those who voted "present" are part of the party's progressive wing. Every Republican voted against the security money, a day after 35 GOP representatives backed the bipartisan deal to set up the commission to investigate the insurrection. The House plans to leave Washington for three weeks, with its next votes expected the week of June 14. The bill passed Thursday would pay back the National Guard and Washington, D.C., for costs incurred securing the Capitol this year, and provide the Capitol Police with overtime pay, retention bonuses and trauma resources. It also would create a response force that would aid the Capitol Police in emergencies, boost security for members of Congress and fortify doors and windows in the Capitol. Democrats moved to pass both pieces of legislation this week. They say it is vital to better understand how a mob of Trump supporters overran the Capitol and disrupted the count of President Joe Biden's electoral win — and to prevent it from happening again. House Republican leaders, who have tried to divert attention from the attack and curb criticism of former President Donald Trump 's election conspiracy theories that helped to fuel it, pushed against passage of both bills. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., has vowed to bring at least the commission plan to a Senate vote. He could face a difficult time winning over the 10 Republicans needed to get it or the supplemental funding through the chamber. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., said Wednesday he would oppose the commission to investigate the attack, contending it could duplicate congressional and federal law enforcement probes. While he did not explicitly say he would vote against the security funding, he signaled Tuesday that he was reluctant to back the current bill. "We're not sure what to spend the money on yet. So I think we are pushing the pause button here," he said. It is also unclear whether Democrats could keep all 50 members of their caucus on board in the Senate. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a New York Democrat who voted "present" on the funding bill Thursday, said he does not think more money for the Capitol Police solves what he said caused the attack: "a lack of coordination, preparation, and sharing of intelligence," along with festering white supremacy. "We need to reimagine public safety entirely and investigate those who were complicit in this attack. Pouring billions more into policing does not accomplish that goal," he said in a statement. Rioters overwhelmed Capitol Police, broke through barricades, smashed windows and overran the Capitol as lawmakers counted electoral votes on Jan. 6. The mob came within moments of reaching top government officials. The attack disrupted the affirmation of Biden's victory for hours. It took roughly three hours for the Pentagon to approve a National Guard response to retake the Capitol. The guard has kept a presence around the legislature since Jan. 6. Some Republicans expressed concerns about the bill's provision setting up an emergency response force within the D.C. National Guard. House and Senate Armed Services Committee ranking members Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and James Inhofe, R-Okla., said in a statement Wednesday that "we cannot and should not militarize the security of the Capitol Complex." Lawmakers from both parties have also expressed concerns about making the Capitol grounds permanently look like a militarized zone. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov held their first face-to-face meeting since President Joe Biden took office. The talks, which came on the heels of the Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting in Iceland, lasted approximately 90 minutes. The discussion between Blinken and Lavrov comes as the U.S. pushes back against Russia on a number of fronts.	WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov emphasized areas where Washington and Moscow could work together, despite their stark differences, in a cautious first first face-to-face meeting since President Joe Biden took office. The meeting Wednesday evening, which came on the heels of the Arctic Council ministerial talks in Iceland, lasted approximately 90 minutes and was described by a senior State Department official as a "businesslike, productive discussion." Blinken thanked Lavrov for taking the meeting and emphasized areas in which the two countries could cooperate. "There are many areas where our interests intersect and overlap, and we believe that we can work together and, indeed, build on those interests," Blinken said, listing the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change. Lavrov echoed Blinken's remarks in finding common efforts in curbing the nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea. On the heels of the meeting, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a call that the talks were "constructive" but added that "a lot of problems have accumulated" between Washington and Moscow. Peskov said the Kremlin has not yet decided on a potential summit later this year between Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biden proposed a meeting, which would take place outside of the U.S. and Russia, during a call with Putin in April . The discussion between Blinken and Lavrov, the highest-level in-person talks between Washington and Moscow under the Biden administration, comes as the U.S. pushes back against Russia on a number of fronts. Earlier this month, the Colonial Pipeline fell victim to a sweeping ransomware attack that forced the U.S. company to shut down approximately 5,500 miles of pipeline, leading to a disruption of nearly half of the East Coast fuel supply and causing gasoline shortages in the Southeast. Ransomware attacks involve malware that encrypts files on a device or network that results in the system becoming inoperable. Criminals behind these types of cyberattacks typically demand a ransom in exchange for the release of data The assault which was carried out by a Russian criminal cybergroup known as DarkSide is the latest cyberattack targeting U.S. critical infrastructure. After the attack, Biden told reporters at the White House that the U.S. did not currently have intelligence linking the DarkSide group's ransomware attack to the Russian government. "So far there is no evidence from our intelligence people that Russia is involved although there is evidence that the actor's ransomware is in Russia, they have some responsibility to deal with this," Biden said on May 10 . He added that he would discuss the situation with Putin. The Kremlin has previously denied claims that it has launched cyberattacks against the United States. In March, the United States sanctioned seven members of the Russian government for the alleged poisoning and subsequent detention of Alexei Navalny, the leading critic of Putin in Russia. The sanctions were the first to target Moscow under Biden's leadership. The Trump administration did not take action against Russia over the Navalny situation. Later in the month, Biden called Putin a "killer" and vowed the Russian leader would "pay a price" for interfering in the 2020 U.S. election and trying to boost Trump's reelection chances. In April, Washington slapped Russia with another round of U.S. sanctions for human rights abuses, sweeping cyberattacks and attempts to influence U.S. elections. The Biden administration also expelled 10 officials from Russia's diplomatic mission in the United States. Moscow has previously denied any wrongdoing and has dismissed U.S. allegations. Russia described the latest moves by the White House as a blow to bilateral relations and vowed to impose swift retaliatory measures. In response to the U.S. action, Russia expelled 10 U.S. diplomats from the American Embassy in Moscow and sanctioned eight senior U.S. administration officials, including FBI Director Christopher Wray and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines. Last month, tensions between Washington and Moscow rose as Russia increased its military presence along the Ukrainian border, sparking concerns in the West of a potential war between the two neighboring countries. Russia ordered its troops to withdraw from the border last month. Before the withdrawal, the Russian Defense Ministry said it was conducting more than 4,000 military drills to inspect the readiness of its forces. The Ukrainian government said four of its soldiers were killed by Russian shelling in Donbass, where Russian-backed separatists oppose the central government in Kyiv. At the time, the Kremlin denied claims that its forces were in eastern Ukraine and reiterated that Moscow will continue to move its forces across Russian territory at its discretion and called the escalating tensions "unprecedented."
CNN anchor Chris Cuomo participated in a series of strategy calls advising his brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, on how to respond to numerous allegations of sexual misconduct, The Washington Post reported. The calls took place as multiple women came forward to accuse the Democratic governor of making inappropriate comments or touching them without permission. CNN acknowledged to the Post that Chris Cuomo was involved in the calls.	CNN anchor Chris Cuomo participated in a series of strategy calls advising his brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, on how to respond to numerous allegations of sexual misconduct, The Washington Post reported Thursday . The calls — which included top aides, lawyers and outside advisors for Cuomo — took place earlier this year, as multiple women came forward to accuse the Democratic governor of sexually harassing them or otherwise making them feel uncomfortable with his words or behavior, the report said . CNN acknowledged in a statement to the Post that Chris Cuomo had participated in the calls. Chris Cuomo, host of CNN's "Cuomo Prime Time," advised the governor on the calls not to resign and encouraged him to take a defiant stance against the allegations, the Post reported, citing four people familiar with the discussions. Chris Cuomo used the politically charged phrase "cancel culture" during one call, two people told the newspaper. Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, acknowledged the calls took place, telling CNBC in an email that "there were a few phone conversations, with friends and advisers giving the governor advice." Azzopardi did not respond when asked if Chris Cuomo was one of those people advising the governor. Chris Cuomo had repeatedly interviewed his brother on his show about the coronavirus pandemic — an area where the governor had initially been praised for presenting an image of decisiveness and transparency amid the crisis. But as the cloud of scandal overshadowed Andrew Cuomo's office, the CNN host declared in March he would not be reporting on the harassment allegations against his brother "because he is my brother." Multiple investigations into the allegations against Andrew Cuomo are underway. CNN told the Post that it was a mistake for Chris Cuomo to participate in the calls. "Chris has not been involved in CNN's extensive coverage of the allegations against Governor Cuomo — on air or behind the scenes," CNN told the Post. "In part because, as he has said on his show, he could never be objective. But also because he often serves as a sounding board for his brother." "However, it was inappropriate to engage in conversations that included members of the Governor's staff, which Chris acknowledges," CNN's statement said. "He will not participate in such conversations going forward." A spokesman for CNN did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Andrew Cuomo has in recent months been embroiled in a compounding series of scandals that have prompted a chorus of calls for his resignation, including from many Democratic politicians in his state . Among the most damning charges came from New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is probing Cuomo's administration for significantly underreporting deaths from Covid in state nursing homes. This week, the governor came under fire again after his tax filings showed he would earn $5.1 million from a book published last October that purported to offer "leadership lessons" about the pandemic. That book, which critics now call a misleading and premature victory lap, has led to claims Cuomo misused the resources of his office. The New York Times reported Wednesday that federal prosecutors have been looking into whether the governor's office granted special access to rapid Covid test results for certain people — including Chris Cuomo and other family members — in the early days of the pandemic. The latest developments in the Cuomo family's scandal saga came after AT&T, which owns CNN, announced a $43 billion deal to merge WarnerMedia with Discovery . Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav, who will lead the new company, said it would keep CNN. Read the full report from The Washington Post.
The longtime CFO of the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg, is under criminal investigation by the New York attorney general's office in connection with his taxes. The investigation comes as prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's office have eyed Weisselberg and his adult sons in their own criminal probe of former President Donald Trump and the Trump Organization. News of the probe comes two days after Attorney General Letitia James' spokesman said her office was investigating the Trump Organization in "a criminal capacity."	The longtime chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg, is under criminal investigation by the New York attorney general's office in connection with his personal taxes, an official close to the probe told NBC News. The investigation comes as prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's office have eyed Weisselberg and his adult sons in their own criminal probe of former President Donald Trump and the Trump Organization. News of the probe comes two days after Attorney General Letitia James' spokesman said her office was investigating the Trump Organization in "a criminal capacity." Several investigators from the AG's office have been deployed to work with Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance's team. James already was known to be conducting a civil investigation of the company related to allegations that it misstated the value of real estate properties for financial benefit. Weisselberg had been deposed by James' investigators as part of that probe. Weisselberg's lawyer, Mary Mulligan, declined to comment on the criminal probe of his personal taxes, which was first reported by The New York Times. A Trump Organization spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The official who spoke to NBC News said the probe by James' office into Weisselberg stems partly from documents shared with investigators by his former daughter-in-law Jennifer Weisselberg. Jennifer Weisselberg, a former ballet dancer, also has provided records to Vance's investigators for their own probe and has met with those investigators multiple times. Her lawyer, Duncan Levin, told WNBC News, "Ms. Weisselberg has been in touch with prosecutors from the criminal division of the New York Attorney General's Office since at least March." Levin added: "She has provided information to them as part of their criminal investigation and will continue to cooperate in any way she can be helpful." Jennifer Weisselberg's ex-husband Barry is a longtime employee of the Trump Organization. She recently told NBC News that Allen Weisselberg "discusses everything with" Trump about the company's financial workings. "And Donald trusts him to continue the legacy the way his father set things up," she said. Vance's office is eyeing benefits that Barry Weisselberg received from the Trump Organization, which include a Central Park apartment where Jennifer and Barry lived for several years, rent-free. Trump on Wednesday blasted James for criminally investigating his company. "There is nothing more corrupt than an investigation that is in desperate search of a crime," Trump said. "But, make no mistake, that is exactly what is happening here."
President Joe Biden is directing the federal government to develop a strategy to curb the risk of climate change on public and private financial assets in the U.S, the White House said Thursday. The order requires Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the head of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to deliver a report on financial risk data related to climate change. The move is part of the Biden administration's longer-term agenda to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030 while curbing the damage climate change poses to all industries.	President Joe Biden is directing the federal government to develop a strategy to curb the risk of climate change on public and private financial assets in the U.S, the White House announced on Thursday. The executive order, titled Climate Related Financial Risk, directs National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy and Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese to develop a government-wide plan to identify and disclose climate risk on government programs, assets and liabilities within the next 120 days. The order also requires Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen , the head of the Financial Stability Oversight Council , to deliver a report on financial risk data related to climate change. The council includes Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The move is part of the Biden administration's longer-term agenda to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030 and transition to a net-zero economy by mid-century while curbing the damage climate change poses to all economic sectors. "The agency actions spurred by the President's directive today will help safeguard the financial security of America's families, businesses, and workers from the climate related financial risks they are already facing," according to a fact sheet released by the White House. "We know that the climate crisis, whether through rising seas or extreme weather, already presents increasing risks to infrastructure, investments, and businesses," it said. "Yet, these risks are often hidden." Biden's order follows a recent report by the International Energy Agency that warns the pathway to a net-zero future is "narrow" as many countries fail to back up various carbon emissions pledges and urges an end to investment in new fossil fuel projects. Tracey Lewis, a senior climate financial policy analyst at the international environmental organization 350.org, said the president's order must mobilize the entire financial sector to end fossil fuel financing. "The Federal Reserve must act on its key role in tackling the climate crisis, including Biden appointing a real climate leader to reimagine the Fed in its role as the Peoples' Bank," Lewis said. Biden's order directs Labor Secretary Marty Walsh to cancel or revise rules from the Trump administration aimed to prevent investment firms from accounting for environmental, social and governance factors like climate risk in investment decisions, a move the Biden administration said will help protect workers' pensions. Under Biden's order, the federal government will also develop and publish an assessment of its climate risk exposure to help guide Biden's budget projections.
The Democratic National Committee went into May with over $56 million on hand, the most the committee says it has ever had in its war chest at this point in any year. The DNC finished the month of April raising $15.6. million, also a record, according to figures first shared with CNBC by a committee spokesperson. While the DNC raised more than the Republican National Committee in April, the GOP campaign arm went into May with significantly more cash on hand, $90 million, FEC records show.	The Democratic National Committee went into May with over $56 million on hand, the most the committee says it has ever had in its war chest at this point in any year. The DNC finished the month of April raising $15.6. million, according to figures first shared with CNBC by a committee spokesperson. The DNC plans to release more details of its fundraising haul in Federal Election Commission filings later on Thursday. "The DNC will report $15.6 million raised in April, the highest off-year April fundraising ever. The DNC has $56.3 million cash on hand, the most the DNC has had at this point in any year," the committee representative said in a statement. The Republican National Committee, by comparison, raised over $13 million in April. Yet while the DNC raised more than the RNC last month, the GOP campaign arm went into May with significantly more cash on hand, FEC records show. The RNC had over $90 million on hand going into the month, according to the records. Former President Donald Trump has also been fundraising off his leadership PAC, Save America, while large parts of the Republican Party continue to seek his approval as he considers running in 2024. He has also continued to falsely claim that the 2020 election was rigged against him. The DNC's haul shows that Biden and the Democratic are in a position to be well-prepared for the fight to advance the president's agenda and for next year's midterm elections. Biden has said he intends to run for reelection in 2024 . Continued success from the DNC would give the president solid financial resources to get his campaign off the ground.
Israel's security Cabinet approved a tentative cease-fire after 11 days of fighting with Hamas in Israel and the Gaza Strip. The latest round of fighting has marked the worst outbreak of violence since the war between Israel and Hamas in 2014. "I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely and are to enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and democracy," President Biden said from the White House. "My administration will continue our quiet relentless diplomacy toward that end. I believe we have a genuine opportunity to make progress and I'm committed to working for it," he added.	Israel's security Cabinet voted Thursday to approve a tentative cease-fire after 11 days of fighting with Hamas in Israel and the Gaza Strip, raising hopes that the worst violence in years was nearing an end. Speaking to the Arabic TV network Al-Mayadeen, a Hamas official said the group "obtained guarantees from the mediators" that Israeli airstrikes on Gaza would be halted. The cease-fire began at 2 a.m. Friday local time. U.S. President Joe Biden, in an address shortly after 6 p.m. ET Thursday , said he was informed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel had agreed to a "mutual, unconditional cease-fire to begin in less than two hours." Biden said Egypt informed him that Hamas, which had fired thousands of rockets into Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, had also agreed to halt hostilities. He thanked Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for the critical role Cairo played in negotiating the truce. "I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely and are to enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and democracy," Biden said from the White House. "My administration will continue our quiet relentless diplomacy toward that end. I believe we have a genuine opportunity to make progress and I'm committed to working for it," he added. The news of a cease-fire came on the heels of a call Wednesday between Biden and Netanyahu. During that call, Biden said he expected a "significant de-escalation" in violence, according to the White House. It was their fourth conversation since violence erupted last week between Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic political party with an armed wing of the same name that controls the Gaza Strip. The tenor from Washington toward Tel Aviv grew increasingly impatient in recent days, as the death toll in Gaza from Israeli airstrikes topped 200, including more than 100 women and children. In Israel, 12 people were killed by rockets fired by Hamas as of Thursday afternoon. The latest round of fighting has marked the worst outbreak of violence since the war between Israel and Hamas in 2014. In his address on Thursday, Biden extended his condolences to Palestinian and Israeli families who lost loved ones and reaffirmed that the U.S. would work with the United Nations and others to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza and help the territory rebuild. "We will do this in full partnership with the Palestinian Authority, not Hamas, in a manner that does not permit Hamas to simply restock its military arsenal," Biden added. The White House, in the days leading up to the cease-fire, pursued a strategy of what it calls "quiet, intensive diplomacy" behind the scenes. "We have had over 60 calls, from the president on down, with senior leaders in Israel, the Palestinian Authority and other leaders in the region" since the start of the conflict, White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday . "The president has done this for a long time, for decades, he believes this is the approach we need to be taking," she added. Biden appeared reluctant to publicly pressure Netanyahu to halt the airstrikes on what Israel says are military targets embedded in civilian neighborhoods in Gaza. This has prompted calls from progressive Democrats in Congress and U.S. allies abroad for the president to take a more visible role and exert more diplomatic pressure on Israel, which is deeply reliant on the United States for weapons and military equipment. Biden, in his conversation with Netanyahu on Thursday, reaffirmed U.S. support for Israel's right to self defense against Hamas rocket attacks. The president also told the prime minister that the U.S. would help Israel replenish its Iron Dome defense system, which is used to intercept such rocket attacks.
Federal prosecutors said "the mere fact" that Rudy Giuliani is a lawyer — one who represented former President Donald Trump — does not mean he is "immune to a criminal investigation." Their filing pushed back on efforts by Giuliani's attorneys to attack the legality of search warrants for his iCloud account in 2019 and for the former New York City mayor's Manhattan home and office last month. Giuliani is under criminal investigation for his dealings in Ukraine.	Federal prosecutors said in a court filing Friday that "the mere fact" that Rudy Giuliani is a lawyer — one who represented former President Donald Trump — does not meant he is "above the law or immune to a criminal investigation." The filing pushed back on efforts by Giuliani's attorneys to attack the legality of search warrants for his iCloud account in 2019 and for his Manhattan home and office last month , which were issued as part of an ongoing criminal probe into his activities in and related to Ukraine. Eighteen electronic devices belonging to New York's former mayor and to employees of Giuliani Partners were seized in late April as part of those warrants. Giuliani's lawyers argue that the search of his iCloud — which was not known to Giuliani for about 18 months — may have violated his attorney-client privilege and the right of Trump as president to have his communications with his lawyer protected. And they say the recent search warrants may be tainted by their reliance on information obtained from the iCloud search. Another well-known Republican lawyer, Victoria Toensing, was the subject of similar search warrants. "The warrants authorizing the searches of those devices were issued by a United States District Judge — this Court — on a finding that there was probable cause to believe that those devices contained evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of specified federal crimes," prosecutors from the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York wrote in their new filing in Manhattan federal court. Prosecutors said the search of devices and electronic accounts belonging to attorneys such as Giuliani and Toensing "requires special care in order to protect the confidentiality of attorney-client communications that may be found in search materials." To that end, prosecutors said they have "gone above and beyond those obligations" by asking a judge to appoint a so-called special master to review the recently seized materials for potentially privileged material, which then would be kept from investigators who are conducting the criminal probe of Giuliani. Prosecutors said a so-called filter team served that purpose in reviewing the 2019 warrants for his and Toensing's iCloud accounts. "But, to be clear, the mere fact that Giuliani and Toensing are lawyers does not mean that they are above the law or immune to criminal investigation," prosecutors wrote. "Yet that is effectively what Giuliani and Toensing argue in their motions: because they are lawyers, the execution of search warrants, upon them was illegal and inappropriate, and as such they are entitled to the extraordinary and unprecedented remedy of converting lawfully-issued search warrants into subpoenas, so that they can review their own materials and decide what the Government gets to see. That is not the law, and their requests otherwise should be denied," the filing said. Prosecutors argued in the filing that a judge should deny requests by Giuliani and Toensing to unseal the affidavits filed to obtain the warrants. Giuliani's lawyer, Arthur Aidala, pushed back against the prosecutors' filing. "In the government's submission, they allude to the fact that Mr. Giuliani is arguing he is above the law," Aidala wrote in a text message to CNBC. "No one is saying Mayor Giuliani is above the law," Aidala wrote. "However, the government is obligated to follow the specific procedures that must be adhered to when reviewing material obtained from a lawyer by means of a search warrant as opposed to issuing a subpoena." Aidala added: "Any lawyer has an attorney-client privilege that he must protect on behalf of his clients." "That privilege is doubly enhanced when the lawyer's client is the President of the United States who also enjoys Executive privilege," Aidala said. Giuliani played a key role in trying to dig up damaging information about President Joe Biden and his son Hunter related to the latter's business dealings in Ukraine. At the time, Biden was gearing up to run for president and was widely considered to be Trump's most viable Democratic challenger.
Connecticut state Sen. Alex Kasser has hired lawyer Robert Cohen, who also represents Melinda Gates in her mega-billion-dollar divorce with Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Cohen previously represented the first two wives of former President Donald Trump. Kasser is embroiled in a heated divorce case with Seth Bergstein, a top executive at Morgan Stanley.	An already contentious divorce case of a Connecticut state senator and her top Morgan Stanley executive husband has gotten even hotter with the arrival of a high-powered new lawyer — who also represents Melinda Gates in her mega-billion-dollar bust-up with Microsoft founder Bill Gates . The new divorce attorney, Robert Cohen, also repped former President Donald Trump 's first two wives, Ivana Trump and Marla Maples. Cohen is now working on the newly expanded legal team of Sen. Alex Kasser, D-Greenwich, which this week fired off a legal shot that threatens to draw other Morgan Stanley employees and the firm itself into the divorce case. Kasser's lawyers asked a judge to allow them to question three Morgan Stanley employees under oath over what they suggest the investment bank's recent improper efforts to get personal financial information from her even as her estranged husband, Seth Bergstein, continues working there as senior managing director and head of global services. "Plaintiff [Kasser] is in possession of evidence suggesting that Defendant [Bergstein] abused his authority at Morgan Stanley ... vis-à-vis these subordinates," says a new filing that was written by Cohen's law partner, John Farley. "He also appears to have encouraged MS employees to use false and coercive communications with the Plaintiff to induce her to disclose personal financial information to which he was not entitled, seemingly to gain an improper advantage in ongoing contested divorce proceedings in this court," the filing says. Those employees, who worked in Morgan Stanley's private wealth management and risk management divisions, in late April gave Kasser "false information" about FINRA regulations, court orders and Connecticut state law as part of that effort, the filing alleges. The inquiry was related to a joint account at Morgan Stanley that Kasser has shared for two decades with Bergstein. Firm employees claim it had been "red flagged" and barred from receiving Kasser's tax refund check "until we can confirm the account holder's total net worth." Kasser's lawyers also suggest that Bergstein may have acted illegally in July 2016 by asking a notary public at Morgan Stanley to notarize an executed document for him for one of his trusts without actually witnessing him or his brother sign that document. "Defendant appears as a result to have committed a crime by this knowing instruction to a subordinate to do an illegal act," Farley wrote in the filing. That request to the notary is documented in an email attached to a new court filing in Stamford, Connecticut, Superior Court, where the divorce trial of Bergstein and Kasser is set to kick off in August. Other emails submitted in court by Kasser's lawyers indicate the shifting explanations Morgan Stanley employees gave her for their inquiries about her net worth, and the lack of direct answers to questions Kasser posed to them about those inquiries. One of those emails, from Private Wealth Executive Director Howard Gofstein, told Kasser that the query about her net worth was based on FINRA's anti-money laundering and know-your-client regulations. The message added that "we need to update when know but at least every three years.[sic]" The court filing by Farley says, "There is also no regulatory requirement that a bank 'update ... at least every three years.'" "The Court should also be aware that improper use of the securities laws can have serious regulatory consequences for financial institutions and their employees," Farley wrote. A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley and Bergstein's lawyer, Janet Battey, declined to comment to CNBC. Kasser, who previously worked as a lawyer for the white-shoe firm of Skadden Arps, also declined to comment. The new allegations have amped up what was from the beginning a bitter case filed more than two years ago, when Kasser split from Bergstein, with whom she has three children. She thereafter began a romantic relationship with another woman — Nichola Samponaro — who also happens to have been the campaign manager of her 2018 race for the state Senate. CNBC in 2019 detailed how court records showed that Bergstein, before his wife left him, suggested in 2018 that Samponaro be paid as a member of Kasser's legislative staff with money he was willing to provide. Bergstein suggested that money would be funneled through a private company, which at one point was owned by Kasser's mother, or through a shell company, records show. That money was never paid by Bergstein, filings say. Samponaro left Kasser's employ in her Senate office shortly after the senator took her seat when questions were raised about Samponaro's salary being paid directly by Kasser. Kasser has since changed her last name, which used to be Bergstein, and continued her relationship with Samponaro. Kasser also gained headlines for spearheading a bill in the Connecticut legislature dubbed Jennifer's Law , which seeks to expand the legal definition of domestic violence to include the concept of "coercive control." Coercive control is defined as a partner doing things such as withholding money or engaging in a threatening pattern of behavior to prevent the other partner from leaving the relationship. Kasser's bill passed the Senate with almost unanimous support on Tuesday. Kasser won re-election to her seat by a margin of more than 2% last fall . Her district encompasses Greenwich and parts of Stamford and New Canaan. Before she first won in 2018, that seat had not been held by a Democrat in nearly 90 years. Meanwhile, Kasser's divorce case has largely flown under the media's radar for the past two years. But that could change with the recent, previously unreported arrival of the New York matrimonial lawyers, Cohen and Farley, as new members of Kasser's legal team. The group already included accomplished Connecticut divorce litigators. In addition to the first Mrs. Trumps , Cohen's matrimonial clients have included former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg , KKR & Co. co-founder Henry Kravis, supermodel Christie Brinkley. He currently represents Melinda Gates, who early this month jointly announced her split from Bill Gates after 27 years of marriage. Bill Gates' net worth is estimated at north of $134 billion. Cohen declined to comment for this article. But another high-profile New York divorce lawyer suggested Kasser has made a good decision hiring Cohen. "He's a fantastic lawyer," said Marilyn Chinitz, whose own celebrity matrimonial clientele has included the actors Tom Cruise and Michael Douglas. "He's talented, he's aggressive." Chinitz currently is involved in four matrimonial cases in which Cohen is representing the opposing party. "Having a case with Bob can be challenging, but it's good to have a case with one who knows the law, and he is a good litigator," Chinitz said. "He's creative in ways to solve a case."
New York Attorney General Letitia James introduced a bill that would tighten the rules governing the use of force by law enforcement. The centerpiece of the legislation would change the use-of-force law "from one of simple necessity to one of absolute last resort," James' office said in a press release. James invoked the memories of George Floyd and other unarmed men and women of color who have died in altercations with police, directly tying those high-profile deaths to her push for police reform.	New York Attorney General Letitia James introduced a measure Friday that would tighten the rules governing the use of force by law enforcement. It would lower what her office calls the "exceedingly high standard for prosecuting police officers" who wrongly take excessive or lethal actions. The centerpiece of the legislation would change the use-of-force law "from one of simple necessity to one of absolute last resort, mandating that police officers only use force after all other alternatives have been exhausted," James' office said in a press release. James at a press conference Friday afternoon invoked the memories of George Floyd and other unarmed men and women of color who have died in altercations with police, directly tying those high-profile deaths to her push for police reform. "At a time of racial reckoning in this country, it's important that we reform the laws and that we provide justice for all individuals who feel that their lives do not matter," James said. The bill was unveiled four days before the one-year anniversary of the killing of Floyd, whose death at the hands of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin ignited a nationwide protest movement against police brutality and systemic racism. Chauvin's recent conviction on murder and manslaughter charges is the "exception that proves the rule," James said at the press conference. She was accompanied by Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, an unarmed Black man who died in 2014 after then-New York Police Department officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in a chokehold. The Department of Justice in 2019 under then-Attorney General William Barr chose not to pursue charges against Pantaleo in Garner's death . James' office touts the new bill, dubbed the Police Accountability Act, as "the most far-reaching use of force reform in the nation." But "this is not going to change those split second decisions that officers must make," in life-threatening situations, James assured, attempting to head off inevitable criticism that the bill could hamper cops' ability to enforce the law and that it could create a chilling effect on recruitment. "There are reasonable protections that officers need in situations like those," James said. "That is not what these reforms are about." The Police Benevolent Association of New York City, a major police union, nevertheless blasted the bill as a danger to New York cops. "This sweeping proposal would make it impossible for police officers to determine whether or not we are permitted to use force in a given situation," the union's president, Patrick Lynch, said in a statement to CNBC. "The only reasonable solution will be to avoid confrontations where force might become necessary," Lynch said. "Meanwhile, violent criminals certainly aren't hesitating to use force against police officers or our communities." "The bottom line: more cops and more regular New Yorkers are going to get hurt," Lynch said. By establishing a "last resort" standard for the use of force, the legislation would require officers to first exhaust alternative approaches, the attorney general's office said. Those methods include "de-escalation, lower levels of force, verbal warnings" and other tactics. The bill would also raise the standard of proof of criminal conduct required to establish justification for lethal force. Current New York law allows officers to use lethal force "based simply on an officer's reasonable belief" that a person committed a certain category of crime, according to James' office. In addition, the bill would allow prosecutors to probe whether an officer's own conduct led to them later requiring the use of lethal force. It would also impose criminal penalties for officers who "employ force that is grossly in excess of what is warranted under the circumstances," the press release said. "Currently, the 'excessive use of force' is a term of poetry in the state of New York. This important legislation corrects that and defines it in the law," said New York state Sen. Kevin Parker, a Democrat, who sponsored the bill.
Ten House Democrats are pushing congressional leaders not to scrap a provision that seeks to end qualified immunity as part of police reform talks. Lawmakers are trying to craft a bipartisan bill that could get through both chambers of Congress after the House passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Congress is set to miss President Joe Biden's deadline to pass a bill by May 25, the one-year anniversary of Floyd's death. Qualified immunity shields officers from civil lawsuits in most cases.	Ten House progressives on Friday urged congressional leaders to end qualified immunity in a developing police reform bill, as a dispute over whether to weaken the rules shielding officers from civil lawsuits stalls progress toward a bipartisan agreement. Lawmakers led by Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., have worked to craft a plan that could win the Republican support needed to get through both chambers of Congress. They have tried to tweak a House-passed bill, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which among other changes aims to ban chokeholds, carotid holds and no-knock warrants, and seeks to end qualified immunity. The protections officers have from civil lawsuits now pose the main obstacle toward passing a reform bill in response to the largest movement against systemic racism and police violence in decades. Congress will miss President Joe Biden 's deadline to pass policing legislation by May 25, the one-year anniversary of when George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck for roughly nine minutes. In the letter sent Friday to the top Democrat and Republican in the Senate and House, the 10 House Democrats said they were "concerned" about the prospect of negotiators removing the qualified immunity language in order to strike a bipartisan deal. "Given that police violence, as a weapon of structural racism, continues to have devastating and deadly consequences for Black and brown lives across our country, we strongly urge you to not only maintain but strengthen the provision eliminating qualified immunity as negotiations in the Senate continue," wrote the lawmakers, who included Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. The police reform negotiators have held talks for weeks as they try to craft a bipartisan deal. The push to strike an agreement comes as police use of force against Black Americans roils communities including Elizabeth City, North Carolina, where sheriff's deputies fatally shot 42-year-old Andrew Brown Jr. a month ago. It is unclear now what both parties would accept as a qualified immunity compromise. The 10 House Democrats did not explicitly threaten to vote against a bill if it does not weaken rules protecting officers from lawsuits. However, their opposition alone could sink legislation in the House if a bill does not win a significant share of GOP votes. Bass — chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and the lead author of the House-passed plan — earlier this week downplayed the need to meet Biden's deadline as long as lawmakers ultimately pass a bill. As the House will leave Washington for the next three weeks, Congress likely will not approve legislation until next month at the earliest. "The most important thing is that we have a bill that hits the president's desk, not the date that it does," Bass said Tuesday. White House press secretary Jen Psaki added Thursday that the White House is "in close touch" with lawmakers and would "certainly defer to the expectations of the key negotiators here." Scott has previously floated the prospect of allowing police departments, rather than individual officers, to face civil lawsuits. Asked Tuesday if the negotiators were making progress on qualified immunity, Scott said, "I think every time that we meet, we make progress." Some Senate Republicans have expressed concerns that scrapping qualified immunity would open officers and departments up to a rash of lawsuits. Others have contended the conviction of Chauvin on charges including second-degree murder shows the current system can hold officers accountable for misconduct. In their letter to congressional leaders, the 10 House Democrats pointed out that guilty verdicts — or even criminal charges — are rare in cases of killings by police. "As a result of qualified immunity, police killings regularly happen with virtual impunity. It's long past time for that to end," they wrote. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
The White House on Friday stressed that its bid for a global minimum corporate tax is more than a talking point for the globe's economists. Biden advisor Daleep Singh told CNBC that the effort to persuade allies to adopt a minimum tax is motivated by both economic and national security factors. "It's not just a tax issue. It's about: How do we fund initiatives that we think are central to our domestic renewal?" he said.	The White House on Friday stressed that its effort to institute a global minimum corporate tax is a top priority for President Joe Biden and represents more than merely a talking point for the globe's economists. Daleep Singh, who serves as both a deputy national security advisor and as a deputy National Economic Council director, told CNBC that the effort to persuade allies to adopt a minimum tax is motivated by both economic and national security factors. "It's not just a tax issue. It's about: How do we fund initiatives that we think are central to our domestic renewal?" he said. Singh explained that unifying the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development behind the minimum tax would afford all members a chance to compete solely on their ability to foster innovation and the ingenuity of their respective workforces. The U.S. Treasury Department has taken the lead in trying to persuade contemporary nations to adopt a global minimum tax. The department unveiled its 15% target on Thursday, and said that it was encouraged by early conversations with foreign officials in the past week. A global minimum tax would also allow governments to better generate revenues for domestic projects that the Biden administration deems important to national security, Singh said. "Our national security strategy is predicated on domestic renewal. So, the kind of challenges I was describing earlier — the inequality that we observe, the enormous importance of addressing an existential climate crisis, people dropping out of the workforce — the government has to play a more active role in addressing those challenges." Treasury was quick to note that the 15% proposal, below where some had forecast, should be thought of as a sort-of floor and that subsequent talks could eventually push it higher. As head of the department, Secretary Janet Yellen has repeatedly stressed the importance of stopping an international "race to the bottom" on global corporate tax rates. If a coalition of countries agree to the 15% rate, it could help governments raise revenues and prevent certain jurisdictions from monopolizing the market for incorporation. Countries with lower corporate rates, like Ireland and its 12.5% rate, have historically expressed doubts about efforts to drum up support for a unified approach. Even a few defectors to the plan could jeopardize the initiative by setting lower rates and effectively inviting companies to relocate there. The average top corporate rate among OECD countries is 23.5%, according to a 2020 Tax Foundation study. Still, those in favor of a global minimum argue that some countries, via various tax breaks and incentives, routinely lure corporations with far-looser taxation schemes. Asked how the administration plans to persuade low-tax countries to agree to Washington's plans, Singh said he and his colleagues are stressing the importance of a level playing field in terms of tax policy. "We are very clear: Companies have been competing for too long on the basis of [countries'] tax rates. That's a destructive race to the bottom that leaves everyone worse off. Especially workers, who are generating an ever-growing share of our tax revenues," he said. "So our proposal is to agree on a minimum tax rate for corporations across the world. And then, we compete on our ability to innovate, on the dynamism of our workforce, and our technological edge," Singh added. That may be why the Biden administration has opted for a flexible benchmark: Low enough not to spook skeptical countries, but open to edits down the road. The rate "matches the minimum tax for highly profitable companies the Biden Administration is proposing, so 15% is in line with where Biden believes the lowest level of the corporate taxes, when all deductions are fully accounted for," Raymond James analyst Ed Mills told CNBC in an email Thursday evening. "This is lower than the 19% President Obama proposed and recognizes that even 15% will be a heavy lift," he added. The Biden administration is in the middle of fierce negations at home, specifically for two massive pieces of legislation that would fundamentally reshape parts of the U.S. economy. The infrastructure-heavy American Jobs Plan would invest several hundred billion dollars to rebuild hard infrastructure but also to fund scientific innovation, pay home health aides and construct about 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations. Its parallel proposal, the American Families Plan , would earmark $1.8 trillion to funding for social programs that include paid family leave and free community college. The White House hopes to fund much of that spending through its Made In America tax plan, a sweeping revision of the tax code that seeks to expand the IRS in order to crack down on tax evasion, end the stepped-up basis to assess inherited capital gains, and institute the global minimum tax. The Biden team has also proposed raising the U.S. corporate rate to somewhere between 25% and 28% . He wants households that make over $1 million per year to pay more on capital gains and to end the carried-interest loophole.
The Democratic chairman of the Senate Banking Committee sees economist Lisa Cook as his top choice to fill the Fed board's remaining vacancy. A staffer familiar with Sen. Sherrod Brown's thinking said the Ohio lawmaker supports her candidacy based on her expertise, research, and lived experience as a woman of color. If nominated and confirmed, Cook would be the Fed board's first Black woman.	The Democratic chairman of the Senate Banking Committee sees economist Lisa Cook, an advocate for remedying racial and gender income inequality, as his top choice to fill the remaining vacancy on the Federal Reserve's governing board, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. If nominated and confirmed, Cook would be the Fed board's first Black woman. A staffer familiar with Sen. Sherrod Brown's thinking said the Ohio lawmaker supports Cook's candidacy for the Fed's Board of Governors based on her expertise, research, and lived experience as a woman of color. Cook is a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University. She is also a member of the steering committee at the Center for Equitable Growth, a progressive Washington-based think tank that counts several of President Joe Biden's top economists among its alumni. Other congressional staff cautioned that while Cook may be a favorite among committee leadership, it's still early in the vetting process and that some Democrats still need to meet with potential candidates before making a final decision. Staff spoke to CNBC on the condition of anonymity because the Fed deliberations are private and ongoing. Cook's confirmation is not assured, however. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, Cook will need to win the support of every Democrat in order to be confirmed to the seat. The top Republican on the Banking Committee, retiring Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, has yet to weigh in publicly on any board seat candidates. A representative for Toomey's office did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. Still, Brown's early backing may prove invaluable to Cook in the months ahead as the White House considers whom to nominate to the central bank's governing committee. Fed governors carry outsized clout at the central bank as voters at every regular Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the body that decides whether to adjust interest rates in the U.S. economy. The full term of a governorship is 14 years. In Cook, Democrats would likely find a Fed governor sympathetic to progressive policies that prioritize issues such as maximum employment, income inequality and addressing race-based economic disparities. While the decision on whom to nominate rests with the president, Cook's background would likely appeal to a Biden administration focused on building the middle class, rectifying racial inequities and improving the nation's health care and infrastructure. Earlier this year, Cook wrote an essay about the need to bring more women and people of color into the science-based, innovation workforce. Cook predicted, for example, that if women were equally represented in engineering and innovation jobs, it could increase U.S. per capita GDP by 2.7%. This kind of thinking underscores a central pillar of the emerging Biden doctrine: That government should help to open the doors for women and people of color in lucrative and growing fields, such as green energy technology, that have traditionally been dominated by men. Neither the White House nor Cook responded to CNBC's request for comment. The Biden administration is in the midst of building support in Congress and across the country for Biden's domestic agenda, specifically for two massive pieces of legislation that would fundamentally reshape parts of the U.S. economy. The American Jobs Plan, an infrastructure-focused proposal, would invest $2.3 trillion over a decade to rebuild hard infrastructure but also to fund scientific innovation, pay home health aides and build half a million electric vehicle charging stations. Its accompanying proposal, the American Families Plan , would dedicate $1.8 trillion to funding for social programs that include paid family leave, free early childhood education and free community college. The White House hopes to fund much of that spending through its Made In America tax plan, a sweeping revision of the tax code that seeks to expand the IRS in order to crack down on tax evasion, end the stepped-up basis to assess inherited capital gains, and institute a global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15%. The Biden team has also proposed raising the U.S. corporate rate to somewhere between 25% and 28% . He wants households that make over $1 million per year to pay more on capital gains and to end the carried-interest loophole. Cook is not the only progressive economist under consideration for the vacant seat. Bloomberg News reported in February that the administration was also looking at William Spriggs, the chief economist of the AFL-CIO, the biggest federation of unions in the country. The governor's post is vacant because Biden's predecessor, President Donald Trump, failed to drum up enough support for his preferred nominee, Judy Shelton. She came under scrutiny for having advocated, years earlier, for a return to the gold standard. The first term of the current Fed chairman, Trump appointee Jerome Powell, expires in February of next year.
Corporate leaders are now fighting behind the scenes against new, Republican-supported voting laws they consider too restrictive, following repeated attacks from GOP leaders and their well-funded allies. Since the outcry earlier this year over the passage of Georgia's new voting law, which critics say unfairly targets minorities, many executives and companies are now airing out their concerns in private, according to multiple people briefed on the matter. Executives are attempting to sway lawmakers at state and federal levels, including advocacy for the Democratic-backed John Lewis Voting Rights and For the People acts in Congress.	Corporate leaders are now fighting behind the scenes against Republican-supported voting laws they consider too restrictive, following repeated attacks from GOP leaders and their well-funded allies. Since the outcry earlier this year over the passage of Georgia's new voting law, which critics say unfairly targets minorities, many executives and companies are now airing out their concerns in private, according to multiple people briefed on the matter. Some executives have said they are concerned that the laws could hurt their employees. Companies such as Coca-Cola and organizations such as Major League Baseball protested the Georgia law. GOP officials in other states, including Texas, have pushed legislation criticized by Democrats and voting rights activists. Some people who spoke with CNBC declined to be named in this article in a bid to avoid retribution. Others declined to be named since these efforts are in progress and details have yet to be made public. Executives are attempting to sway lawmakers at state and federal levels, including advocacy for the Democratic-backed John Lewis Voting Rights and For the People acts in Congress. One of the campaigns at the state level involves pressuring NCAA leaders to come out with a forceful response to voting laws being introduced in Texas, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. Another features a legion of corporate attorneys responding to voting laws being crafted in Pennsylvania. The shift to behind-the-scenes campaigns comes after top Republicans, including the governors of Texas and Georgia, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, slammed corporate leaders for taking a stand against the voting laws. "There is some real behind the scenes work to try to get corporations that decided, 'Hey, taking on Republican leaders publicly isn't the best tactic,' and decided working with lobbyists behind the scenes to get rid of some of these provisions is a better path," Tom Rogers, the former CEO of TiVo and a former NBC executive who helped found CNBC and MSNBC, said in an interview Thursday. Rogers said he has been in touch with executives involved in the effort. The behind-the-scenes effort also comes after hundreds of business leaders and corporations signed a public statement opposing "any discriminatory legislation or measures that restrict or prevent any eligible voter from having an equal and fair opportunity to cast a ballot." The nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice says that as of March, legislators have introduced 361 bills with restrictive voting provisions in 47 states. The new Georgia voting law, according to an analysis , creates stricter guidelines on acceptable voter identification, a limitation on the amount of drop boxes in certain counties and an effective ban of third party groups giving out water to people standing on line at the polls. Georgia-based Coca-Cola's CEO James Quincey took aim at the state's voting law in an interview with CNBC. Quincey and Coca-Cola are being targeted in an advertising campaign by groups such as conservative outfit Consumers' Research. American Airlines , which is headquartered in Texas, came out against a state bill the company said has "provisions that limit voting access." Consumers' Research is also targeting the airline's CEO, Doug Parker. Privately, business leaders are targeting specific laws within their home states, according to Jeffrey Sonnenfeld , a leadership expert and Yale professor who organized virtual meetings with corporate executives to decide on a response after Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed his state's law. "The next stage is taking a look at the state-by-state issues," Sonnenfeld said, describing recent conversations with executives. "The business community has to drill down to state-by-state efforts." Some of the moves go beyond the broader public statements that many companies have signed, Sonnenfeld and others said. In many cases, corporations are trying to play a balancing act in responding to laws they deem as restrictive and possibly unconstitutional, while also trying to come off as nonpartisan. One such effort involves business leaders pressuring the heads of the NCAA, the national college athletic organization, to have a similar response as they did after North Carolina passed its transgender bathroom ban in 2016, a person familiar with the lobbying push said. Following that bill's passage, the NCAA pulled at least seven collegiate championship games from North Carolina. The bill was later repealed and the NCAA subsequently lifted its ban. Now, a person familiar with the lobbying effort says, business leaders opposed to the Texas voting proposals are pushing the NCAA to make a similar move in the Lone Star State if the bill becomes law. The group Progress Texas has said the NCAA should consider withdrawing from having future basketball tournament games in Texas. A press representative for the NCAA responded to CNBC's inquiry by pointing to a statement released by its board of governors in April. "While voting integrity is essential to the election process, an equal and fair opportunity for all Americans to vote cannot be diminished in any way, and we wholeheartedly support efforts to assist all in exercising this fundamental right," the statement says. Another effort in Texas links back to a letter that was signed by over 180 local business and community leaders, as well as 50 corporations, including American Airlines, NBC News reported earlier this month. The letter calls on "all elected leaders in Texas to support reforms that make democracy more accessible and oppose any changes that would restrict eligible voters' access to the ballot." Though there was no specific mention of a particular bill in the letter, these corporate leaders have been privately engaging with Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both Republicans, stressing that these bills could have a negative impact on companies' employees, a person familiar with the outreach told CNBC. Patrick said in April that he had heard from an American Airlines executive who apparently told him the company was going to oppose voting legislation within a state bill. In April, The Texas Tribune says the bill, if signed into law, "would limit extended early voting hours, prohibit drive-thru voting and make it illegal for local election officials to proactively send applications to vote by mail to voters, even if they qualify." The response from companies privately and publicly seems to have made a difference in Texas. The Texas House has passed a pared-down version of one of the bills that included voting legislation. It's now up for a vote in the state Senate. Sonnenfeld also pointed to Pennsylvania, where Brad Karp, a lawyer and chairman of legal giant Paul Weiss, has organized a group of almost 100 lawyers to respond to any potential restrictive voting laws in that state. Karp declined to comment further to CNBC when asked about this effort. The Brennan Center lists a dozen Pennsylvania state bills that it says restricts voting. Pennsylvania has a Democratic governor, but Republicans control the legislature. While several corporations are battling the various GOP-backed voting laws in certain states, there is also an effort to garner business support for two different federal voting rights bills. Business leaders, along with the Michelle Obama-backed voter registration group When We All Vote, and their allies, including some corporate members of Time to Vote, are putting together a statement in support of the For the People Act, according to people familiar with the move. Time to Vote promotes itself as a "nonpartisan effort for companies that want to contribute to the culture shift needed to increase voter participation in our country's elections." Over 700 companies, according to Time to Vote's website, have joined the organization, including Bank of America , Nike , Discovery and ViacomCBS . The For the People Act recently passed the Democratic-led House and is being considered in the evenly divided Senate. Experts at the Brennan Center say it "would curb voter suppression and make it easier for all Americans to register to vote and cast a ballot. It would outlaw partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts." A When We All Vote representative declined to comment further. Corporations are also looking at signing a letter to congressional lawmakers that would be in support of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, according to a person directly involved with the planning. If introduced and later passed, the law would help limit voting restrictions. Both laws face long odds in the Senate. Corporations that have signaled willingness to sign the letter to support the voting rights act include payment company PayPal , technology giant Salesforce , and candy and pet food company Mars, this person said. These corporations did not return requests for comment.
The White House made an infrastructure counteroffer to Senate Republicans on Friday, trimming its original proposal down from $2.3 trillion to $1.7 trillion. The $600 billion in cost reductions came partly from shifting elements of the American Jobs Plan over to other legislation currently under consideration. In response, Republicans said the new proposal was still "well above the range of what can pass Congress with bipartisan support."	WASHINGTON — White House aides working on a bipartisan infrastructure deal made a counteroffer on Friday to Republican senators, reducing the Biden administration's initial proposal by $600 billion. Within hours, those Republicans threw cold water on the new proposal and said the sides now seemed "further apart" after what had appeared to be progress in negotiations. The latest offer would cost $1.7 trillion over a decade, according to a memo from the White House to Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, of West Virginia, who is spearheading negotiations for the GOP. In order to trim the original $2.3 trillion plan down to $1.7 trillion, the White House says it would agree to: The memo said Biden hoped the proposed changes to his initial offer would "spur further bipartisan cooperation and progress." But it was immediately evident that little progress had been made over the past week on central elements of a bill. These include the basic definition of what "infrastructure" is, and the mechanisms to pay for it. Republicans have proposed their own $568 billion infrastructure bill, with a narrow focus on hard infrastructure, rural broadband and transit. In the Biden counteroffer, these are all areas that would get cut. An aide to Moore Capito responded to the offer in a statement Friday, calling the White House proposal still "well above the range of what can pass Congress with bipartisan support." "Based on today's meeting, the groups seem further apart after two meetings with White House staff than they were after one meeting with President Biden," she said. On Saturday, White House spokesman Andrew Bates said Biden had made "a reasonable offer in the interest of finding bipartisan common ground...The ball is now in their court to respond with a good faith counter-offer." But the White House memo is also striking for what Biden does not agree to compromise on. For instance, the White House has not yet come down from the $400 billion that Biden has proposed to fund home and community-based elder care. Republicans argue that this does not meet the definition of "infrastructure." Biden's offer also holds the line on the funding he has proposed for electric vehicles, veterans hospitals and workforce training, all of which Republicans have questioned. On the pay-for side, the White House counteroffer still includes one of the GOP's red-line issues: An increase in the corporate tax rate. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that any infrastructure plan that includes a corporate tax increase would be opposed by the entire Republican caucus. White House press secretary Jen Psaki called Friday's counterproposal "the art of seeking common ground." Biden's negotiators presented the counteroffer to Republican senators during a video conference that began shortly after lunch on Friday. The White House team included counselor to the president Steve Ricchetti, director of legislative affairs Louisa Terrell, National Economic Council director Brian Deese, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. As the second week of formal negotiations came to a close Friday, Republicans and Democrats appeared no closer to a bipartisan compromise than they were at the start.
The U.N. Security Council urged a "restoration of calm in full" in its first statement on the 11-day conflict between Israel and Hamas. The U.S. had previously blocked the council from issuing a statement calling for an end to the conflict, arguing that doing so would hinder its diplomatic efforts The U.N. said Friday that it released $22.5 million in humanitarian aid to Gaza.	The U.N. Security Council on Saturday called for a "full adherence" to the cease-fire in Gaza and urged immediate humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians in its first statement on the 11-day war between Israel and Hamas.  The cease-fire, which took affect at 2 a.m. Friday local time, has held so far despite clashes in Jerusalem outside Al Aqsa mosque between Israeli police and Palestinians just hours after the truce officially began. Al Aqsa mosque is one of the most sacred places in Islam and sits in a site known in Judaism as the Temple Mount, the religion's holiest site. Clashes at the complex were one of the factors that sparked the war. The security council urged a "restoration of calm in full" and emphasized "achieving a comprehensive peace based on the vision of a region where two democratic States, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace with secure and recognized borders." The U.S. had previously blocked the U.N.'s most powerful body from calling for an end to the conflict, arguing that doing so would hinder diplomatic efforts by the Biden administration to help achieve a cease-fire. Israel hit Gaza with scores of airstrikes and Hamas militants fired more than 4,000 rockets at Israel. Palestinian medical officials said at least 248 people were killed in Gaza, including 66 children and 39 women. At least 12 people were killed in Israel, all civilians except one soldier. The security council "mourned the loss of civilian lives resulting from the violence" and expressed support the U.N. Secretary General's call to develop an "integrated, robust package of support for a swift, sustainable reconstruction and recovery." More than 77,000 Palestinians have been displaced and reconstruction costs in Gaza could amount to tens of millions of dollars, according to Palestinian officials, with damage to infrastructure affecting water, sanitation and hygiene services. The U.N. said Friday that it released $22.5 million in humanitarian aid to Gaza . A day earlier, President Joe Biden promised the U.S. would work with the U.N. to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinians and help rebuild Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to travel to Israel and the West Bank next week to build on the cease-fire, according to Reuters. Egyptian mediators are also continuing talks with Hamas and Israel to secure longer-term calm after the truce — Reuters contributed reporting
Amazon is close to a deal to buy MGM Studios for between $8.5 billion and $9 billion, sources say. It would be Amazon's biggest acquisition since it bought Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion. A transaction could be announced as soon as Tuesday, sources say.	Amazon is nearing a deal to acquire MGM Studios, the co-owner of the James Bond franchise and other film and TV series, for between $8.5 billion and $9 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal is expected to be announced as soon as Tuesday. The people asked not to be named because the talks are private. It would mark Amazon's biggest acquisition since it bought Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion . The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Monday that the deal could be announced this week. Amazon is interested in acquiring more TV and film content for its Prime Video service as it competes with Netflix , Disney and other streaming video services. MGM is a natural fit for any streaming service because of its plethora of content. MGM, which is a private company, has been seeking a buyer for several years . Its owners include Anchorage Capital, Highland Capital Partners, Davidson, Kempner Capital Management, Solus Alternative Asset Management and Owl Creek Investments — funds that took control of the studio when it emerged from bankruptcy in 2010. MGM owns a number of famed movie and TV franchises, including Rocky, Legally Blonde, The Pink Panther and Stargate. It also owns a studio, which has made more current hit TV shows, including "The Handmaid's Tale" and "Fargo." MGM owns a number of popular reality TV shows, including "Shark Tank," "Survivor," "The Real Housewives" series and "The Voice." MGM also owns Epix, a premium pay-TV service valued at about $1.3 billion in 2017. MGM and Amazon representatives weren't immediately available to comment.
BlackRock's proprietary Geopolitical Risk Indicator fell to a four-year low as markets focus more on inflation and the economic recovery than geopolitics, BlackRock Investment Institute said in a report Monday. "Geopolitical shocks could catch investors more off guard than usual," the analysts said. "We see a high likelihood that decoupling of the U.S. and Chinese tech sectors accelerates in scale and scope, despite the relatively low attention to the Global technology decoupling risk," the report said.	While investors have been preoccupied with rising prices, a flare-up in U.S.-China tensions could catch investors by surprise, BlackRock warns. BlackRock Investment Institute said in a report Monday that its proprietary Geopolitical Risk Indicator has fallen to its lowest in four years, as investors focus more on inflation and the economic recovery than geopolitics. That marks a shift in attention from U.S.-China trade tensions or a North Korea nuclear attack, both of which have rattled markets in the last few years. "The gauge has been hovering in negative territory this year ... meaning investor attention to geopolitical risks is below the average of the past four years," the report said. "As a result, geopolitical shocks could catch investors more off guard than usual." One of the major risks markets might be overlooking is the separation, or "decoupling," of the world's two largest economies in technology. The analysts noted U.S. President Joe Biden has continued his predecessor's tough stance on China "with a focus on critical technologies," while Beijing is prioritizing self-reliance in tech. "We see a high likelihood that decoupling of the U.S. and Chinese tech sectors accelerates in scale and scope, despite the relatively low attention to" the risks posed by Chinese and American technology splitting apart, the report said. BlackRock's geopolitical risk indicator is calculated using two metrics. One is a computer-based scoring system for positive and negative mentions of geopolitical risks in brokerage reports and financial news stories. The second metric is a model for potential one-month impact from geopolitical events on global assets. The two measures are then combined to create an index. A positive reading, close to one, indicates the market performance matches the model's prediction for reaction to geopolitical risks. A negative reading reflects markets are moving in a direction opposite to what the model predicts. While BlackRock did not disclose the exact level of the index, the investment institute said Monday the indicator turned negative this year for the first time since 2017 — which means investors' focus on geopolitical risks have fallen below the average of the last four years. BlackRock is the world's largest money manager, with about $8.7 trillion in assets under management. The Wall Street giant's investment institute conducts proprietary research for clients and portfolio managers. According to BlackRock, the indicator's three most-likely geopolitical risks are: Ranking fourth is rising U.S.-China tensions over Taiwan , a self-ruled island which Beijing considers part of its territory. The institute does not expect a "military showdown" over Taiwan this year, but said the tensions pose a "significant medium- and long-term risk." Growing tech rivalry between the U.S. and China means both governments will be investing more in the industry, making it "key to invest in both these poles of global growth," the BlackRock analysts said. In a separate report, they laid out their expectations for market reactions to other geopolitical risks. For example, BlackRock Investment Institute expects the Chinese yuan to weaken if the separation of U.S. and Chinese tech companies accelerates. The analysts anticipate the U.S. dollar will strengthen and U.S. utilities stocks will decline if there's a major cyberattack, and Latin American consumer staples stocks will rise if there is a political crisis in the emerging markets. Global stock indexes have climbed this year as major economies strive to increase vaccination rates and resume business. The CBOE Volatility Index , or the VIX, a gauge of fear in the U.S. market, has fallen about 19% so far this year. In the near term, BlackRock said it's justifiable for markets to focus more on the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and the outlook for inflation. But they cautioned that "geopolitical risk flareups could have an outsize impact when markets least expect it."
India has become the epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic, but it is not the only country with a worsening Covid-19 outbreak. Nations from Argentina to Nepal have reported record increases in Covid cases in the last few weeks, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University showed. The increase in infections have come as progress of vaccinations remained uneven across the world.	India is currently at the epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic — but it is not the only country with a worsening Covid-19 outbreak. From Argentina in Latin America to Nepal in Asia, many other countries have also reported record increases in Covid cases in the last few weeks, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, has expressed concerns over the raging health crisis around the world. "India remains hugely concerning ... but it's not only India that has emergency needs," he said at a news briefing this month. The increase in infections has come as progress of vaccinations remains uneven across the world. Generally, developed countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. are ahead in vaccinating their populations while poorer nations in Africa and parts of Asia are lagging due to limited supply of shots. Here's a look at some places where Covid cases are surging. Argentina has in the last few weeks reported record-breaking numbers of daily cases and deaths, leading authorities to impose fresh lockdown measures that will last until end-May. The measures, which came into force over the weekend, include closing schools and non-essential businesses, as well as banning social, religious and sporting events, reported Reuters.  Reported cases rapidly rose from below 5,000 a day in early-March to a record-high of more than 39,000 last Wednesday, Hopkins data showed. The number of deaths also surged from 112 on March 1 to a record 744 last Tuesday, according to the data. The worsening outbreak has swamped Argentina's health-care system, and President Alberto Fernandez was quoted as saying last Thursday that "we are living the worst moment since the pandemic began." Vaccination is progressing slowly in the country, with around 19% of the roughly 45 million population having received at least one dose, according to statistics site Our World in Data. In Asia, surging Covid cases are overloading Nepal's fragile health-care system. "Our medical infrastructure is in crisis. The oxygen supply-demand gap is huge. We also have no more vaccines," Dr. Samir Kumar Adhikari, the health ministry's chief spokesperson, reportedly said. Nepal, a landlocked country with a population of roughly 29 million, shares a border with India which has been experiencing a devastating second wave. India is now the world's second worst affected country by cases reported. Many people in Nepal blamed returning migrant workers from India for the rapid rise in Covid-19 cases, reported NBC News . Many of the returning  Nepalese had lost their jobs and income when parts of India went into lockdown to curb the second wave of infections there, the report said. That caused Nepal's daily cases to accelerate from below 200 at the start of April to a record-high of more than 9,300 in mid-May, Hopkins data showed. Nepal is scrambling to secure Covid vaccines. The country started vaccinating its people in January with the AstraZeneca vaccine provided by India and Covax, a global alliance aimed at fairly distributing vaccines, reported Reuters. However, the South Asian nation has run out of shots with the Serum Institute of India yet to deliver the doses that Nepal ordered, the report said. India has halted exports of Covid vaccines as it prioritizes its domestic needs. Among countries with surging coronavirus cases, Bahrain stood out as one of the few that have vaccinated a relatively large proportion of its population. Reported cases in Bahrain jumped from around 600 a day in early-March to above 2,000 a day last week, according to Hopkins data. Bahrain has approved several Covid vaccines for use, including Pfizer - BioNTech , China National Pharmaceutical Group or Sinopharm , and Russia's Sputnik vaccine. The country's latest outbreak has contributed to concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines from Sinopharm and Sputnik. That's especially so as other highly vaccinated countries — such as Israel and the U.K. — which rely mostly on western-developed shots, are reporting a decline in cases. China, on its part, appeared to suggest last month that Chinese vaccines "don't have very high protection rates." The official who made the remark later tried to walk back on those comments, and said he was misunderstood. But within Bahrain, the number of deaths reported daily — while increasing — has largely remained low even as infections are rising rapidly. Before the latest resurgence, Taiwan was widely applauded for its success in containing the spread of Covid-19 without a full lockdown. The island with a population of roughly 24 million recorded just 1,128 cases — of which a large majority were imported — and 12 deaths by end-April, Hopkins data showed. But the number of daily cases surged past 200 in the last week, the data showed. Such numbers remain a lot smaller compared to most countries and territories around the world, but are a milestone for Taiwan where daily life had largely continued as normal before the latest spike. Some media reports blamed Taiwan's complacency for the renewed outbreak. Taiwanese authorities had relaxed quarantine requirements for airline crew members in mid-April; and a hotel near Taoyuan International Airport was found housing flight crews on quarantine with other visitors — which led to a cluster of infections in the latest outbreak. Authorities have since imposed new social-distancing rules that limited social gatherings, closed some businesses and tightened border restrictions. Taiwan, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates globally, is also trying to ramp up efforts to vaccinate its population.
The price of bitcoin popped about 4% Monday afternoon after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he was having active discussions regarding the sustainability of the digital coin. Musk's tweets and comments around cryptocurrency often send the prices soaring or plunging.	The price of bitcoin jumped about 4% Monday afternoon after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he was having active discussions regarding the sustainability of the digital coin. Bitcoin was trading around $38,074, according to Coindesk , when at about 3:42 p.m. ET Musk posted on Twitter : "Spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current & planned renewable usage & to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising." Within minutes, the price had shot up to more than $39,500. Overall, the coin is up more than 17% in the last 24 hours. Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor followed up on Musk's tweet, saying he hosted a meeting between the Tesla CEO and some bitcoin miners that led to the formation of the Bitcoin Mining Council, which will promote sustainability. Musk has been a big supporter of cryptocurrencies, helping rally the prices of digital coins, including bitcoin, several times in the past year. His tweets and comments around cryptocurrency often send the prices soaring or plunging. In an SEC filing in February, Tesla revealed that it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and would accept it as a form of payment. The company later said it registered a net gain of $101 million from sales of bitcoin during the quarter, helping to boost its net profits to a record high in the first quarter. However, his relationship with the digital coin changed earlier this month. He tweeted on May 12 that the company " suspended vehicle purchases" using bitcoin , out of concern over "rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels" for bitcoin mining. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
As the West expressed outrage at Belarus' "hijacking" of a Ryanair plane, Russia defended the country, describing the reaction as "shocking." Russia has been steadily increasing its power and influence over its neighbor Belarus, but the countries' leaders are uncomfortable allies Analysts said Moscow stands to benefit from Belarus' further estrangement from the West.	As global leaders expressed outrage at Belarus' "hijacking" of a Ryanair plane and the detention of an opposition activist , Russia was notable for its vociferous defense of the country. Now, analysts are saying Moscow stands to benefit from Belarus' further estrangement from the West. Belarus on Sunday ordered a Ryanair flight carrying prominent Belarusian opposition activist Roman Protasevich to divert to its capital Minsk, whereupon the activist was detained . Russia described the uproar in the U.S. and Europe as "shocking" and accused the West of having double standards. "It is shocking that the West calls the incident in Belarusian airspace 'shocking'," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Facebook on Monday. Russia has been steadily increasing its power and influence over its neighbor Belarus, but the countries' leaders President Vladimir Putin and President Alexander Lukashenko are somewhat uncomfortable allies — it's arguable that any allegiance is fragile at best, and borne out of necessity. For Belarus, Russia is a powerful economic and political partner and a source of support, having backed Lukashenko's leadership which is now in its 27th year. For Russia, Belarus offers an opportunity to exert economic and political influence in the region, and is a convenient bulwark against what it sees as the European encroachment upon its former territories, such as Ukraine. Putin is known to favor stability and predictability and, as such, a longstanding leader like Lukashenko in power — who can potentially be more easily influenced — is favored over regime change. Experts who follow Russia closely say Putin would have known, if not authorized, the "hijacking" incident. Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, noted on Monday that ""Lukashenko is now totally dependent on Putin for his survival in office and would not have risked his relationship with the Kremlin by undertaking such a cavalier move unless he had been first given the green light by Putin." "I think if anyone doubted whether Lukashenko was 'all in' with Putin, in his power vertical/sovereign democratic model, and indeed of Belarus's deeper integration into Russia, then I think this sends a resounding answer ... there are no bridges left standing back to the West, and he is willing to surrender Belarus' sovereignty to save his own skin." Read more:  Belarus accused of ‘hijacking’ plane to arrest activist, provoking outrage in the West Putin's leverage over Lukashenko strengthened recently when, last September, Putin gave Belarus a $1.5 billion loan and agreed to boost trade. The move was widely seen as a gesture of support for Lukashenko following weeks of mass protests demanding his resignation after he won an election which the opposition said was rigged. Lukashenko denied this allegation. Like Russia, Belarus is also subject to international sanctions, namely for its intimidation and repression of protesters, opposition members and journalists . On Monday, EU leaders agreed to impose more sanctions on Belarus but analysts believe any new restrictions on Lukashenko, or other individuals or entities involved in the incident, are likely to be ineffective. In fact, Emre Peker, director of Europe at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, noted Monday that the Ryanair plane "hijacking" incident was likely to benefit Russia by pushing Belarus closer to it — sentiment that was echoed elsewhere. "President Vladimir Putin is likely to welcome the incident as a further issue driving a wedge between Belarus and the West," Peker said in a note. "Allegations of Russian involvement, meanwhile, will further complicate the EU's ability to effectively respond to Belarus. Moscow accused the EU and its members of double standards, and will defend Minsk's handling of the incident. Similarly, any new EU sanctions will draw Russian condemnation as Western interference ... While Berlin will push for a strong EU reaction if Protasevich is not released, Germany is unlikely to target Nord Stream 2 in connection with the Ryanair incident." Matthew Sherwood, senior Europe analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said Monday that the whole episode shines a light "on how little sanctions are affecting domestic politics in Belarus." "The most recent set of sanctions were imposed after the disputed presidential election in August 2020, which led to protests that lasted for several months. However, with continued Russian political and economic support, Mr Lukashenka and his allies have been able to crack down on the opposition movement domestically, and the protests have largely fizzled out," he said. "We do not expect a new wave of Western sanctions to have any further real impact on the domestic situation, and they are likely to drive Belarus even closer to Russia." Other analysts note that the Lukashenko regime is becoming increasingly unpredictable, perhaps emboldened by its relations with Russia. Nigel Gould-Davies is former U.K. ambassador to Belarus and a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the IISS. He told CNBC on Monday that the Ryanair incident showed that "Lukashenko is now an international threat, and not just a threat to his own people." "Secondly, it shows how insecure he feels himself to be if he goes to such trouble to detain a single journalist and risk international outrage and condemnation in violating international rules in this most flagrant way," he added. "It shows he really doesn't care about threatening the lives of European and American citizens just to get a single person who has been publiciz2ing the oppression of his own people." Gould-Davies said that if it was true that Belarusian KGB officials were on board the flight — as Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said he believed to be the case — it showed that KGB officials were active abroad. It demonstrated the "international dimension of the threat that this regime presents to the countries around it," he added, noting that other countries, especially Russia, would be watching closely to see how the EU reacts. "We have seen recent examples of the Russia and Belarusian security services cooperating with one another so we need to look at that angle too ... It's imperative that the EU, and I hope with American support too, will take a much stronger and more concerted stand now." Bluebay's Ash agreed that the incident presented "a massive test for the EU and the West. Do they understand the threat now to Western liberal market democracy," he asked. "This is not just a defensive action from Lukashenko but a full frontal attack on the EU - an EU plane, travelling between two EU capitals, forced out of the air by a autocratic regime. If the West lets Lukashenko get away with this, no Western airline is safe, flying across any autocratic run country. The skies and dissidents are not safe."
President Joe Biden will host George Floyd's family at the White House on Tuesday, an administration official confirmed to CNBC. The visit marks the one-year anniversary of Floyd's death, which triggered international protests against racism and police brutality. Congress is set to miss the president's deadline to pass a police reform bill by the anniversary of Floyd's death.	President Joe Biden will host George Floyd's family at the White House on Tuesday, an administration official has confirmed to CNBC. The visit marks the one-year anniversary of Floyd's death, which triggered international protests against police brutality and racism in the criminal justice system. Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck for about nine minutes. Chauvin was found guilty of murder and manslaughter in April. His sentencing date is set for June. The Floyd family's visit to the White House comes as lawmakers attempt to create bipartisan legislation on police reform that could pass through both chambers of Congress. The House passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in March. The police reform bill seeks to ban chokeholds, carotid holds and no-knock warrants as well as end qualified immunity. However, lawmakers have struggled to find a compromise that can win enough support in the evenly divided Senate. Congress is set to miss the president's deadline to pass the legislation by the anniversary of Floyd's death. At least 10 Senate Republicans are needed for the bill's passage due to the chamber's filibuster rule. "It would be a contribution to rebuilding trust in communities," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday with respect to the bill's potential passage. "Obviously, there's more that needs to be done beyond that; that's not the only step — far from it." A point of contention in the negotiations has been on qualified immunity, which makes it difficult to sue individual officers. Ten House Democrats are pushing congressional leaders not to scrap the provision seeking to end qualified immunity. But some GOP senators are concerned that ending it would make officers and departments vulnerable to a rash of lawsuits.
The legislation, released by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, would increase funding by 34% to a baseline of about $300 billion over five years. House Republicans last week introduced their take on a surface transportation funding program — a $400 billion bill. The push on surface transportation comes as Washington struggles to strike a deal on a broader infrastructure package.	A group of Republican and Democratic senators unveiled a transportation package over the weekend that would increase funding for highways, roads and bridges as Congress searches for bipartisan paths to repair the nation's infrastructure. The legislation , released by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, would increase funding by 34% to a baseline of about $300 billion over five years. The previous authorization expired in 2020 and Congress passed a one-year extension which is up in September. "Not only will this comprehensive, bipartisan legislation help us rebuild and repair America's surface transportation system, but it will also help us build new transportation infrastructure," the committee's ranking member Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said in a press release Saturday. The bipartisan proposal is backed by committee chair Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., as well as the chair and ranking members of the transportation subcommittee, Sens. Ben Cardin, D-Md., and Kevin Cramer, R-.N.D. House Republicans on Wednesday introduced their take on a reauthorization of the surface transportation funding program — a $400 billion bill directing funding to highways, bridges and transit systems. The push on surface transportation comes as Washington struggles to strike a deal on a broader infrastructure package. The White House on Friday trimmed its original $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan to $1.7 trillion in a counteroffer to Republican senators, who outlined their own $568 billion infrastructure proposal in April. However, Moore Capito's office said the White House proposal is still "well above the range" of what Republicans in Congress would support.
A year ago, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on the neck of George Floyd for more than 9 minutes, murdering him. Every year, taxpayers in cities and counties across the country pay hundreds of millions of dollars to settle lawsuits filed in response to police misconduct. It's time we had a national database that tracks both misconduct and the costs. Our legislation—The Cost of Police Misconduct Act — would create such a database.	There's the human cost of police misconduct. Unarmed Black Americans are killed by police officers with appalling frequency. For young Black men, police violence is one of the leading causes of death . A year ago, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on the neck of George Floyd for more than 9 minutes , murdering him. Throughout the course of the Chauvin trial, at least 64 people died at the hands of law enforcement nationwide . More than half of them were Black or Latino. There's also the social cost of police misconduct. Many Black Americans feel fear when they see a police officer. Black parents have to have " The Talk " with their children because of that fear. Don't make sudden movements. Keep your hands at 10 and 2.  Say "Yes, sir" and "Yes, ma'am."  If you reach for something—do it slowly, but not before telling the police officer what you're reaching for and asking him or her if it's OK. Both the human and social costs of police misconduct are inhumane and incalculable. But there's another type of cost as well: the economic cost of police misconduct. Notably, police officers and police departments don't bear the brunt of this cost—taxpayers do. Every year, taxpayers in cities and counties across the country pay hundreds of millions of dollars to settle lawsuits filed in response to police misconduct, lawsuits that are often settled in secret by municipalities to quietly bury criticism and controversy. In many cases, the costliest of these lawsuits are those involving civil rights violations (e.g. excessive use of force) that result in the physical injury or death of residents. News organizations and national non-profits have created databases over the years that track police misconduct, but they are usually only able to track allegations, not cost. It's time we had a national database that tracks both. You can't manage what you don't measure. We need to measure the problem as much as possible, so we can manage it in a way that helps save lives—the most important goal—and taxpayer dollars. Our legislation—The Cost of Police Misconduct Act ( H.R. 1481 and S. 540 )—would create such a database by requiring federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to report to the Department of Justice the amount they spend annually on police misconduct judgments and settlements (including court fees) as well as the number and type of police misconduct allegations they receive. Typically, taxpayers pay for police misconduct judgments and settlements in one of three ways. If their municipality uses liability insurance (typical of smaller municipalities), they pay for them indirectly in the form of premiums. If their municipality uses money from a general or dedicated fund (typical of larger municipalities), then they pay for them directly. The same goes if their municipality issues a bond. Bonds are particularly common for large judgments or settlements that exceed insurer liabilities or the capacity of general or dedicated funds and often result in taxpayers paying nearly double because the city or county must pay fees to financial institutions and interest to investors. One recent study found that from 2008-2017, taxpayers in Chicago, IL (limited to 2010-2017); Cleveland, OH; Lake County, IN; Los Angeles, CA; and Milwaukee, WI, paid an estimated combined total of $1.73 billion in bonds and interest payments for police misconduct. The money taxpayers spend on police misconduct has the potential to defund other municipal services, including those proven to prevent crime. In 1983, South Tucson, AZ, went bankrupt after a police misconduct settlement. In 2017, New Haven, CT, had to issue bonds for a bridge after using funds for that bridge to pay for a police misconduct settlement. In Minneapolis, taxpayers paid $27 million to settle Floyd's murder with his family, one of the largest settlements for police misconduct ever. Because the payout was so large, Minneapolis had to use a combination of its general fund and self-insurance fund to cover the cost, the latter of which has "has been pushed to the brink in recent years" because of police misconduct, the Washington Post reported . The Minneapolis budget for this year allocates just about the same amount for health services ($28 million) as it does for this settlement. In September of last year, a billboard was installed in Times Square across from a New York Police Department (NYPD) station. The billboard read: "Hey NYPD. It's us. NYC residents. The ones who pay your salary. We paid $300 million to settle your lawsuits. You paid nothing. We need to talk." The "talk" that taxpayers in NYC are having with the NYPD about how the department will reform to avoid costly misconduct is a talk that taxpayers in cities and counties across the country need to have with their police departments. They can't have this talk if they don't have the data. Our bill would ensure they do.

Sales jumped nearly a whopping 50% in the first quarter of 2021 at that mystery $100 million New Jersey deli company — but that amounted to only a measly $5,305 worth of food. Losses also jumped big-time at deli owner Hometown International, rising to $173,658 for the quarter. That's about $97,000 more in losses than in the same period last year. Hometown International's latest SEC filing also shows a series of previously unreported developments at the mysterious corporation.	Sales jumped nearly a whopping 50% in the first quarter of 2021 at that mystery $100 million New Jersey deli company — but that amounted to only a measly $5,305 worth of sandwiches, sodas and chips, a new financial filing revealed Monday. Losses also jumped big-time at deli owner Hometown International , rising to $173,658 for the first three months of this year. That's about $97,000 more in losses than in the same period last year. Hometown International's latest filing also shows a series of previously unreported developments at that odd corporation. The moves, like other recent ones, seem designed to clean house and make the company an attractive takeover candidate by a private company. That seems to be the real reason that investors in Hong Kong and Macao have taken big stakes in Hometown International, as opposed to a love of selling cheesesteaks. Those developments include the decision not to renew a $25,000-per-month consulting agreement with a Macao-based entity that is a major investor in Hometown International, the company's 10-Q quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed. They also include the full repayment to the deli owner of two curious $150,000 loans it made to shell companies closely linked to the father of Hometown International's chairman and new president, Peter Coker Jr., the 10-Q shows. Hometown International began drawing public attention in mid-April when hedge-fund manager David Einhorn noted in a client letter that the company had recently had a stock market capitalization of more than $100 million despite having combined sales of less than $37,000 in 2019 and 2020 combined at its Paulsboro eatery. CNBC since then has detailed the criminal histories and regulatory sanctions of a number of individuals linked to the company and other curious details about the deli owner. On the heels of those articles, Hometown International's controlling shareholders terminated a $15,000-per-month consulting deal the company had with Tryon Capital, a North Carolina firm controlled by Peter Coker Sr., who is a major investor in the deli owner. Hometown International then fired its president, Paul Morina , who by day is principal and head wrestling coach at nearby Paulsboro High School . The company also canned its only other executive officer, Christine Lindenmuth, who is an administrator at that same high school. Both Hometown International and a related shell company , E-Waste , have disavowed their sky-high market capitalizations, saying their share prices on the over-the-counter market are unjustified by any financial rationale. The 10-Q, whose filing was delayed for about a week, like other filings by the deli owner, contains details that are incongruous for most companies that have almost 8 million common shares outstanding. The company's stock closed at $12.10 per share on Monday, down 40 cents per share, with just 423 shares changing hands. On paper, at least, Hometown International's market capitalization based on common shares alone is more than $97 million, while its intrinsic value when factoring in tens of millions of shares available through share warrants is a whopping $1.8 billion. Among the odd details in the new filing is the fact the deli had labor costs of $126 for the first quarter. During the same period a year ago, it reported no labor costs at all. Sales, which were just $3,577 for the first quarter in 2020, skyrocketed to $5,305. "The increase in revenue is mainly attributed to an increase in customer's [sic] visits following the re-opening of our delicatessen as a result of the easing of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic," the 10-Q filing states. That filing also shows that on April 30, Hometown International's consulting agreement with VCH Limited, an investor in the company, expired and was "not renewed." That deal had been paying VCH Limited $25,000 per month. VCH Limited is one of four entities that are among Hometown International's biggest shareholders, whose mailing addresses are in Macao, a special administrative region of China. The 10-Q filing notes that $120,000 of the $178,963 in operating expenses for the first quarter were chewed up by the consulting agreements Hometown International had with VCH Limited and Tryon Capital. The filing reveals that as of April 14, Hometown International had received the full principal payments and more than $1,000 in accrued interest for a $150,000 loan to the shell company E-Waste , which is closely linked to Coker Sr. The loan was only issued in November. In a move that mirrored the firing of Molina, E-Waste's president, John Rollo, recently resigned from the company on the heels of CNBC articles about E-Waste, which has no operating business but does have a market capitalization that tops $112 million. Hometown International in February lent $150,000 to another company connected to Coker Sr. — Med Spa Vacations Inc. — of which Rollo remains the head. The deli owner's 10-Q filing shows that on May 12 "the full principal of the note receivable and $2,250 of related accrued interest receivable were fully paid by the noteholder," Med Spa Vacations. Both loans had an interest rate of 6%.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed to the Middle East on Monday in an effort to ensure that the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas holds, after nearly two weeks of fighting. The White House said part of the trip will involve Blinken meeting with Israeli leaders "about our ironclad commitment to Israel's security." Blinken is also scheduled to focus on the U.S.-Palestinian relationship.	Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed to the Middle East on Monday in an effort to ensure that the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas holds. "The most important thing is that the cease-fire does hold. It's extremely important that it does. We don't want to see a return to the bloodshed that was heartbreaking during the 11-day conflict," a senior State Department official said of the trip. Blinken will travel to Jerusalem, Ramallah, Cairo and Amman through Thursday and meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, Jordan's King Abdullah and other top officials. "Following up on our quiet, intensive diplomacy to bring about a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, I have asked my Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, to travel to the Middle East this week," President Joe Biden said in a statement on Monday , emphasizing that part of the trip will involve Blinken meeting with Israeli leaders "about our ironclad commitment to Israel's security." Blinken will also focus on the U.S.-Palestinian relationship, which the Biden statement described as "our Administration's efforts to rebuild ties to, and support for, the Palestinian people and leaders, after years of neglect." Israel's security Cabinet voted Thursday to approve a tentative cease-fire after 11 days of fighting with Hamas in Israel and the Gaza Strip, the worst violence the area has seen since 2014. Negotiations leading to the cease-fire were led by Egypt, the only country with open communication lines with Israel and Hamas, the U.S.-designated terrorist group that governs the Gaza Strip. The news of a cease-fire came on the heels of a call Wednesday between Biden and Netanyahu. During that call, Biden said he expected a "significant de-escalation" in violence, according to the White House. It was their fourth conversation since violence erupted between Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic political party with an armed wing of the same name that controls the Gaza Strip. Israeli airstrikes and internecine fighting killed more than 220 Palestinians in Gaza over 11 days, including more than 100 women and children. During that time Hamas fired more than 4,000 rockets into Israel, killing 12 people, including two children. Biden came under fire from human rights groups and progressive Democrats for perceived inaction as the conflict escalated and for his administration's continued financial and military support for Israel. His administration has revived some support for Palestinians, restoring $235 million in U.S. aid — most of which will go to the UN's refugee program for Palestinians — which was completely cut under the Trump administration. The U.S. provides Israel with $3.8 billion annually in military aid. In early May before the fighting began, the Biden administration approved selling $735 million in precision-guided munitions to Israel — a sale that several progressive Democrats are now trying to halt. The violence in the blockaded Gaza Strip, the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Jerusalem and several places in Israel was triggered by protests surrounding the threat of evictions of some Palestinians from their homes in east Jerusalem by the Israeli government. The demonstrations, largely peaceful but including rock throwing, brought on a harsh Israeli response, such as firing stun grenades into the Al-Aqsa Mosque complex during prayers in the holy month of Ramadan. In response, Hamas fired rocket barrages from Gaza into Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and elsewhere in Israel. Israel then launched airstrikes that the military said was targeted at Hamas, but in the process bombed multiple civilian homes as well as a building housing foreign media outlets including The Associated Press. Israel has occupied the West Bank and east Jerusalem since the 1967 war, building Jewish settlements that the majority of the international community considers illegal under international law. Israel rejects this. Natasha Turak reported from Dubai. Amanda Macias reported from Washington.
Gordon Sondland sued former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the U.S. for $1.8 million in reimbursement for legal fees incurred during Trump's first impeachment probe. The lawsuit alleges Pompeo "made a legally binding promise, both individually and on behalf of the Government," to pay Sondland's attorneys' fees after the ambassador was subpoenaed to testify before Congress. Sondland in 2019 had testified before Congress that then-President Donald Trump sought a "quid pro quo" with Ukraine.	Gordon Sondland, who as a U.S. ambassador in 2019 accused then-President Donald Trump of seeking a "quid pro quo" with Ukraine , on Monday sued former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the U.S. for $1.8 million in reimbursement for legal fees incurred during Trump's first impeachment probe. The lawsuit alleges Pompeo "made a legally binding promise, both individually and on behalf of the Government," to pay Sondland's attorneys' fees after the then-ambassador to the European Union was subpoenaed to testify before Congress. But Pompeo allegedly "reneged on his promise" after learning what Sondland would say to the congressional investigators: that Trump and his aides, including Rudy Giuliani , pressured Ukraine to announce investigations that would involve then-potential Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. "The lawsuit is ludicrous," a spokesperson for Pompeo told NBC News later Monday morning. "Mr. Pompeo is confident the court will see it the same way." The Department of Justice declined NBC's request for comment The bombshell testimony from Sondland, who was a hotelier before being tapped for the ambassador role by the Trump administration, became the centerpiece of the former president's first impeachment in the House. Trump was acquitted in the Senate on the charges he abused his power by leaning on Ukraine to announce the politically charged investigations in exchange for military aid. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, says that Sondland was denied government services to help him with the "staggering" amount of preparation required to comply with the subpoenas in the impeachment probe. Sondland was forced to retain private counsel just days before his first closed-door deposition on Capitol Hill "to reconstruct all the materials needed and to prepare for this daunting task," the legal complaint says. He used those private services "in reliance on Pompeo's promise of reimbursement," the lawsuit says. Sondland testified under oath before several House committees for 17 hours, the final seven of which were broadcast live. His testimony, which addressed the "quid pro quo" that Trump had vociferously denied, was "highly fraught, highly charged, and highly risky with tremendous consequences," the lawsuit says. "For all his troubles, Ambassador Sondland learned that testifying truthfully and candidly before Congress as cameras roll was in fact a fireable offense in Pompeo's Department of State," the complaint alleges. Sondland was recalled from his position on Feb. 7, 2020 , days after the GOP-led Senate voted for acquittal. The legal complaint accuses Pompeo of abandoning his contractual commitment to Sondland "apparently for political convenience." The complaint also argues that if Pompeo should now claim he did not have authority at the time to order the reimbursement of Sondland's legal fees, then "Pompeo was at all times acting for his own self-serving personal or political reasons, to further his interests to protect himself and others." In that case, Sondland "seeks to hold Pompeo personally liable for misrepresenting his authority," the lawsuit says. If Pompeo had no authority to make such a promise to Sondland, then he "intentionally committed fraud," the complaint argues. The complaint alleges that Sondland scheduled a call with Pompeo in October 2019, after being told the Justice Department and the State Department would not represent him in his testimony. On that call, Pompeo and the Trump administration allegedly promised the ambassador that the State Department would reimburse him for all his attorneys' fees and costs of private counsel related to the impeachment proceedings. Sondland's lawyers "heard Pompeo's promise, as they were listening to the call between Pompeo and Ambassador Sondland on a speaker phone," the lawsuit says. The State Department had instructed Sondland not to appear before House committees on Oct. 8, 2019, and Sondland initially complied with that instruction, canceling his appearance. The move "ratcheted up both the formality and adversarial tenor of further proceedings," which affected Sondland's legal fees, the lawsuit alleges. The House then subpoenaed Sondland to testify, and the ambassador acceded. Just over a week later on Oct. 16, Pompeo on a conference call with Sondland once again "promised without any qualification" that the ambassador's legal fees would be reimbursed in full, the complaint alleges. The lawsuit notes that Sondland had been praised by Trump and Pompeo and had a strong rapport with his colleagues before his involvement in the impeachment proceedings. "In fact, when Ambassador Sondland first learned he had been subpoenaed to testify, he was at The White House," the complaint alleges. "During a conversation with President Trump, Ambassador Sondland advised him about his forthcoming testimony. The President responded, 'go ahead and tell the truth,'" it says. On the day he was fired, Sondland's lawsuit alleges he was told by the Trump administration that it "appreciated his testimony" but nevertheless "wanted to purge everyone remotely connected to the Impeachment trial." Sondland refused to resign, and "after that, everything changed," the complaint says. "Since then, the Government has bobbed and weaved in the face of every attempt by Ambassador Sondland and Private Counsel to satisfy the Indemnity Undertaking." The lawsuit was first reported by The Washington Post .
Congress is unlikely to pass a police reform bill before Tuesday, the first anniversary of George Floyd's death and President Joe Biden's deadline to approve legislation. Talks on a bipartisan deal are expected to move forward this week. Rep. Karen Bass and Sens. Cory Booker and Tim Scott, the lead negotiators, said in a joint statement that they "continue to make progress toward a compromise and remain optimistic about the prospects of achieving that goal.” Qualified immunity for officers continues to trip up efforts to strike a final agreement.	Congress is set to miss President Joe Biden 's Tuesday deadline to pass a police reform bill as negotiators decide how far the federal government should go to root out law enforcement misconduct and violence against Black Americans. Tuesday will mark one year since 46-year-old Black man George Floyd died after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes. While worldwide calls for justice and a reimagining of law enforcement sparked reforms or budget cuts in some cities and states in the last year, Congress has yet to exert its power to change American policing. Bipartisan negotiators have worked for weeks to tweak the House-passed George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to win enough Republican support to get it through the Senate. A provision to curb qualified immunity — which shields police officers from most civil lawsuits — poses the biggest remaining obstacle toward reaching a deal. The House has left Washington until next month, so lawmakers likely will not meet Biden's call to pass a bill by the one-year anniversary of Floyd's death. Negotiators, who include Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., and Sens. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., are expected to continue talks this week. "One year ago, George Floyd's murder awakened millions of people around the world who had never before witnessed the deadly consequences of the failures in our policing system," the three lawmakers said in a joint statement Monday. "This anniversary serves as a painful reminder of why we must make meaningful change." "While we are still working through our differences on key issues, we continue to make progress toward a compromise and remain optimistic about the prospects of achieving that goal," they continued. Biden, who has called for approval of the House-passed bill, will meet with Floyd's family on Tuesday. On Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the meeting will be private and will include Floyd's daughter, mother and siblings. Psaki said Biden is "hopeful that he will be able to sign the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act into law." She added that the White House is "engaged" with the congressional negotiators while "leaving them room to work." Biden spoke with Booker on Friday. Democrats have called to roll back qualified immunity to hold officers more accountable for violating civil rights or using excessive force, in part because killings by police rarely lead to criminal convictions. Republicans have raised concerns that weakening the provision could cause officers to face excessive lawsuits. Scott has floated the prospect of making departments, rather than individual police, liable in civil cases. It is unclear now what compromise on qualified immunity could win over enough Democratic and Republican votes for a bill to get through Congress. A group of 10 House progressives on Friday called on negotiators to "not only maintain but strengthen the provision of eliminating qualified immunity" as the talks proceed. Booker said Sunday he is "determined at this negotiating table to get" a provision ending qualified immunity. The Justice in Policing Act as passed by the House would ban chokeholds, carotid holds and "no-knock" search warrants at the federal level. It would also tie federal funding for state and local law enforcement to officials banning those practices. It would make it easier to prosecute police and create a national database of police misconduct. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
President Joe Biden announces that FEMA will double the funding available to help cities and states prepare for extreme weather disasters. The total funds available through BRIC grants will rise to $1 billion this year, up from $500 million in 2020. Biden also announces the launch of a new NASA initiative to more closely track how the climate is changing.	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Monday announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would double the funding available to help cities and states prepare for extreme weather disasters, to $1 billion this year from $500 million in 2020. Biden also announced the launch of a new NASA initiative to more closely track how the climate is changing, and the impact of these changes on local communities, both in the near term and farther into the future. The president revealed the additional funding during a visit to FEMA headquarters, where he received a briefing on the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season and delivered remarks to agency employees. "Now is the time to get ready for the busiest time of the year for disasters in America," Biden said following the briefing. "Hurricane season in the South and East, and the fire season out West." "We all know that the storms are coming, and we're going to be prepared," he added. "We have to be ready." The United States endured last year 22 separate weather and climate-related disasters that each caused more than $1 billion in damages, according t o a White House fact sheet . Taken together, the damages from these 22 disasters — primarily wildfires, hurricanes and snowstorms — amounted to nearly $100 billion. The newly announced funds will be distributed through FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. Created in 2018, BRIC awards grants to states, local communities and tribes to undertake pre-disaster hazard mitigation projects. Monday's actions are the latest in a series of initiatives launched by the Biden administration to help measure and prepare for extreme weather events, which have increased in both frequency and severity as the climate has warmed over the past few decades. Last week, Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to conduct a broad assessment of the financial risks posed by climate change to both government and the private sector The order gives Biden's top economic and climate advisors four months to produce an estimate of how much it would cost to achieve a U.S. economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. From the start of his presidency, Biden has made tackling climate change an integral part of his governing strategy. A centerpiece of his climate strategy, a clean electricity standard, is part of the $2.3 trillion infrastructure package currently being negotiated by the White House and Senate Republicans. The standard would require fossil fuel-burning power plants to gradually adopt carbon free methods of generating power, like wind and solar. Under the standard as currently written, the deadline for making electricity carbon free would be 2035.
At least 20 million doses of vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson will be shipped abroad by the end of June, President Joe Biden will announce. Those plans come weeks after the White House said it would send 60 million doses of AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine to countries in need, once that company's shots were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.	President Joe Biden on Monday will announce that the U.S. plans to send millions of additional coronavirus vaccine doses to foreign countries still being battered by the pandemic. At least 20 million doses of vaccines produced by Pfizer - BioNTech , Moderna and Johnson & Johnson will be shipped by the end of June, Biden will reveal in a Covid-centric speech at 1 p.m. ET, the White House said. Those plans come weeks after the White House announced it would send 60 million doses of AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine to countries in need , once that company's shots are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Combined with the new shipments, the Biden administration aims to send a total of 80 million doses abroad within the next six weeks. That figure amounts to five times more vaccine shared by the U.S. than by any other country so far, according to a senior administration official. This is breaking news.

U.S. commanders have asked for the deployment of an aircraft carrier to help protect U.S.-led troops as they withdraw from Afghanistan, two senior Defense officials told NBC News. The request underscores concerns at the Pentagon that the Taliban may choose to launch attacks on NATO troops as they pull out.	U.S. commanders have asked for the deployment of an aircraft carrier to help protect U.S.-led troops as they withdraw from Afghanistan, two senior Defense officials told NBC News. With fighter squadrons at the ready, an aircraft carrier in the region could provide additional cover in case U.S. and other NATO forces come under fire as they depart by a Sept. 11 deadline set by President Joe Biden. The request underscores concerns at the Pentagon that the Taliban may choose to launch attacks on NATO troops as they pull out. The Taliban has hinted at the possibility that it could target U.S.-led forces after May 1 as the United States had pledged to pull out all forces by the deadline under an agreement signed last year with the insurgents. The New York Times first reported the request. No final decision has been taken on the request from Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, the officials said. "There has been no specific decision about additional assets at this time," one of the officials said. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has made clear the U.S. troop pullout would be carried out in a safe and orderly way, the official added. At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday, Gen. McKenzie said more troops and resources would be deployed to safeguard the forces leaving Afghanistan. At House hearing on Tuesday, Gen. McKenzie said U.S. troops were ready if the Taliban chose to target NATO forces as they withdraw. "I'm confident that we will have the forces necessary to protect our forces should the Taliban decide to begin attacking us on [May 1] or any other date," he said. He added: "We will defend ourselves....We are ready for whatever they choose to do." If a carrier is ordered in, the Eisenhower and Theodore Roosevelt would be likely candidates. The Eisenhower is currently deployed in the Mediterranean Sea and the Roosevelt is homeported in San Diego after its last deployment was cut short by an outbreak of Covid-19 aboard the ship.
President Joe Biden is slated to deliver remarks detailing the final troop pullout in Afghanistan, which will effectively end America's longest war.

President Joe Biden is slated to deliver remarks on Wednesday detailing his plans to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, a final step in ending America's longest war. Biden's announcement comes after a senior administration official said Tuesday the president would pull all troops out of Afghanistan by September 11, or 20 years after the terror attacks that brought the U.S to war. However, the official noted the troop withdrawal could come before that date. In Feb. 2020 the Trump administration inked a deal with the Taliban for a complete troop withdrawal by May 1, 2021. But Biden said the May 1 deadline would be "tough" to meet in a March interview with ABC News. Senators on both sides of the aisle expressed reservations about the administration's plans on troop withdrawal. "Foreign terrorists will not leave the United States alone simply because our politicians have grown tired of taking the fight to them. The president needs to explain to the American people why he thinks abandoning our partners and retreating in the face of the Taliban will make America safer," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, said Tuesday on the Senate floor. "I just am concerned that after so much blood and national treasure, that we don't lose what we were seeking to achieve," Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said Tuesday. Menendez chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Sen. Joe Manchin said he will not vote to eliminate or weaken the filibuster under any circumstances. His position likely brings to a close efforts to lower the barriers to passing parts of President Joe Biden's agenda in Congress. The filibuster generally requires legislation to garner 60 votes in the Senate, which is evenly divided 50-50 among Democrats and Republicans. Democrats have been angling to get rid of or reform the filibuster to pass sweeping legislation.	Sen. Joe Manchin said he will not vote to eliminate or weaken the filibuster under any circumstances, likely bringing to a close efforts to lower the barriers to passing parts of President Joe Biden 's agenda in Congress with only Democratic votes. "The time has come to end these political games, and to usher a new era of bipartisanship where we find common ground on the major policy debates facing our nation," the moderate West Virginia Democrat wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post published Wednesday. The filibuster generally requires legislation to garner 60 votes in the Senate, which is evenly divided 50-50 among Democrats and Republicans. Democrats have been angling to get rid of or change the filibuster — which former President Barack Obama has called a relic of Jim Crow — to pass sweeping elections reform legislation. Manchin has repeatedly said he opposes eliminating the filibuster, but appeared recently to be open to reforms, such as forcing senators who invoke a filibuster to talk at length on the Senate floor. Biden, another supporter of the filibuster, had expressed openness to that idea, saying it was how it "used to be when I first got to the Senate back in the old days." Manchin's outright rejection of any filibuster reform came a day after Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., another moderate, told The Wall Street Journal that she opposed efforts to ease the rules . Manchin, who holds outsize influence as a result of the even divide in Congress' upper chamber, also said he opposed the regular use of budget reconciliation, a mechanism that allows Congress to pass certain bills with a bare majority. The $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill was passed via reconciliation, and Democrats have been preparing to use the process to assure the passage of Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure plan. Manchin has said he opposes the corporate tax hikes included in the bill. Manchin wrote that if the filibuster were eliminated or budget reconciliation became the norm, a "new and dangerous precedent will be set to pass sweeping, partisan legislation that changes the direction of our nation every time there is a change in political control." "The consequences will be profound — our nation may never see stable governing again," Manchin wrote. "I simply do not believe budget reconciliation should replace regular order in the Senate. How is that good for the future of this nation?" Manchin added. "Senate Democrats must avoid the temptation to abandon our Republican colleagues on important national issues. Republicans, however, have a responsibility to stop saying no, and participate in finding real compromise with Democrats." Manchin said his opposition to weakening the filibuster was related to his representation of West Virginia, a small state that wields influence in the Senate that is disproportionate to its population. "It's no accident that a state as small as West Virginia has the same number of senators as California or Texas. It goes to the heart of what representative government is all about," Manchin wrote. Manchin opposed the Democratic-led effort in 2013 to eliminate the filibuster for Cabinet-level nominees and federal judges and the Republican-led effort in 2017 to eliminate it for Supreme Court nominees. Both efforts were successful. "Every time the Senate voted to weaken the filibuster in the past decade, the political dysfunction and gridlock have grown more severe," Manchin wrote. "The political games playing out in the halls of Congress only fuel the hateful rhetoric and violence we see across our country right now."
President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Attorney General Merrick Garland are set to deliver remarks on gun violence prevention Thursday afternoon at the White House Rose Garden. The address comes amid mounting pressure to enact gun reform in the wake of recent mass shootings in Georgia, Colorado and California. Biden is expected to unveil a series of gun control executive actions Thursday and to tap a prominent gun control advocate to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, White House officials said Wednesday.	[The stream is slated to start at 11:45 a.m. ET. Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.] President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Attorney General Merrick Garland are set to deliver remarks on gun violence prevention Thursday afternoon at the White House Rose Garden. The address comes amid mounting pressure to enact gun reform in the wake of recent mass shootings in Georgia , Colorado and California . Biden is expected to unveil a series of gun control executive actions Thursday and to tap a prominent gun control advocate to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, White House officials said Wednesday . The president plans to direct the Justice Department to issue proposals regulating "ghost guns" and stabilizing braces, to create model "red flag" legislation for states and to publish a firearms trafficking report. "Ghost guns" are homemade guns without trackable serial numbers, often assembled from parts bought online. These guns typically do not require background checks. Stabilizing braces are accessories that allow users to fire pistols much like rifles, without being subject to the same regulations as a rifle. "Red flag" laws give family members or law enforcement agencies the opportunity to ask state courts to temporarily block firearms from people deemed to present a danger to themselves or others. The Justice Department has not issued a report on firearms trafficking since 2000. Biden is expected to nominate David Chipman for ATF director. Chipman is a senior policy advisor at gun control advocacy group Giffords and served as a special agent at ATF for 25 years Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube. 
President Biden announced a series of executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence, while urging Congress to pass broader gun-control legislation. The actions were unveiled in the wake of a recent spate of mass shootings across the country, including a deadly attack Thursday in South Carolina. The actions direct the Justice Department to craft a rule addressing untraceable "ghost guns" and to publish example "red flag" legislation for states. Biden also called for a national red-flag law.	President Joe Biden announced a series of executive actions on Thursday to reduce gun violence and urged Congress to pass broader gun-control legislation. The bundle of actions, Biden's first attempt as president to tackle the fraught politics surrounding guns in America, was unveiled in the wake of a recent spate of mass shootings across the country, including Thursday in South Carolina , where five people were gunned down. In the past three weeks, other deadly mass shootings occurred in Georgia, Colorado and California. "This is an epidemic, for God's sake, and it has to stop," Biden said in a Rose Garden speech. The White House's moves include directing the Department of Justice to craft a rule addressing the spread of untraceable "ghost guns" and publish an example of "red flag" legislation for states to follow. Red-flag laws allow police or family members to petition a court to bar an individual from accessing firearms. Biden also called for a federal red-flag law, saying such legislation would prevent suicides, protect women from domestic violence, and stop mass shooters before they carry out an attack. Biden announced he would nominate former federal agent David Chipman to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Chipman, who spent 25 years as an ATF special agent, is a senior policy advisor for the gun-control advocacy group Giffords. Here's what Biden's actions will do, according to the White House: Biden also called for Congress t o end the broad immunity that gun-makers have from being sued for shootings. The administration also hopes to focus investment in "community violence interventions," which are methods for lowering gun violence in cities without incarcerating people, the fact sheet said. Some metropolitan areas, such as New York City, are grappling with a surge in shooting crimes and homicides amid the coronavirus pandemic. In his speech Thursday, Biden lamented that gun violence has become "an international embarrassment" for the U.S. "Our flag was still flying at half staff for the victims of the horrific murder of eight primarily Asian American people in Georgia, when 10 more lives were taken at a mass murder in Colorado," Biden said. He spoke after an introduction from Vice President Kamala Harris, and his speech was followed by remarks from Attorney General Merrick Garland. The president emphasized that the newly announced actions were merely initial steps, and heaped pressure on federal lawmakers to pass gun-reform proposals that have already been approved by the Democrat-led House. "There's much more that Congress can do to help that effort, and they can do it right now," Biden said. "They've offered plenty of thoughts and prayers, members of Congress. But they've passed not a single new federal law to reduce gun violence," he said. "Enough prayers; time for some action." But Biden also said he's "willing to work with anyone to get this done," and expressed a desire to take additional actions, including reinstating a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. "We should also eliminate gun manufacturers from the immunity they receive from the Congress," Biden said. "If I get one thing on my list, Lord came down and said, 'Joe, you get one of these,' give me that one."
Joel Greenberg is expected to strike a plea deal in his criminal case, his lawyer and prosecutors said, NBC News reported. The case against Greenberg led federal investigators to launch a probe into possible sex trafficking by Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, multiple outlets have reported. "I'm sure Matt Gaetz is not feeling very comfortable today," Greenberg's attorney Fritz Scheller told reporters. Gaetz has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.	Joel Greenberg, a former county tax collector in Florida and associate of GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, is expected to strike a plea deal in his criminal case, his lawyer and prosecutors said Thursday, NBC News reported . The case against Greenberg — who had previously pleaded not guilty to charges including sex trafficking of a minor, stalking, wire fraud and identity theft — led federal investigators to launch a probe into possible sex trafficking by Gaetz, multiple outlets have reported. The signal of a forthcoming plea deal came during a status conference in Greenberg's case in Orlando. The defense lawyer and the prosecutors did not say if Greenberg was expected to cooperate in the Gaetz probe, according to NBC. "I'm sure Matt Gaetz is not feeling very comfortable today," Greenberg's attorney Fritz Scheller told reporters Thursday afternoon. Scheller declined to answer when a reporter asked, "Did your client introduce Matt Gaetz to any underaged girls for sexual relations?" A spokeswoman for Gaetz did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Scheller's remarks. The New York Times first reported last month that the Department of Justice is investigating whether Gaetz had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and paid for her travels with him . NBC reported Wednesday that investigators are looking at whether women were paid to travel to the Bahamas with Gaetz for sex, and whether Gaetz and Greenberg used the internet to look up women they could pay for sex. Gaetz has strongly denied the "horrible" allegations in the Times, and declared in an op-ed Monday that he is "absolutely not resigning" from Congress . Gaetz has also asserted that he is the victim of a multimillion-dollar extortion scheme involving a former DOJ official. Law enforcement sources told NBC that there is a separate probe underway regarding those extortion claims. A spokesperson for Gaetz told CBS News on Wednesday night that the congressman "has never paid for sex, nor has he had sex with an underage girl. What began with blaring headlines about 'sex trafficking' has now turned into a general fishing exercise about vacations and consensual relationships with adults." On Thursday afternoon, Gaetz shared a statement from his office, which defends the embattled Republican as "a principled and morally grounded leader" and vows to "stand with him." That statement is attributed to "the women of Congressman Matt Gaetz's office," and it does not name any specific members of his staff. Meanwhile, Gaetz's former advisor Nathan Nelson said Monday that he had been approached by FBI agents and questioned about the GOP lawmaker's alleged involvement in illegal activities. Nelson told reporters he never saw any such illegal conduct and that his departure from Gaetz's office last fall was not related to the DOJ probe, which reportedly began in the final months of former President Donald Trump's term.
President Joe Biden released the outlines of his first budget proposal to Congress, with a $1.5 trillion proposal calling for a significant increase in non-defense spending in areas ranging from climate change to gun violence. Biden's budget proposal highlights campaign promised areas like education, cancer research and climate change. The budget also calls for a slight increase in defense spending, which would primarily be used to fund military salary increases, an administration official said.	President Joe Biden released the outlines of his first budget proposal to Congress, with a $1.5 trillion proposal calling for a significant increase in non-defense spending in areas ranging from climate change to gun violence. Biden is targeting funding increases to areas he campaigned heavily on, calling for a $20 billion boost in funding for schools in low-income areas, the creation of a $6.5 billion medical research program with a focus on cancer, and a $14 billion increase in funds across the federal government to tackle climate change. The budget also calls for a slight increase in defense spending, which would primarily be used to fund military salary increases, an administration official said. The budget blueprint will be used as a starting point for Congress as it makes the final determination on how to appropriate funds. While what is ultimately signed into law will likely be vastly different, it gives a window into where the president's priorities lay. The budget proposal comes as Biden seeks an additional $2 trillion from Congress to fund an infrastructure plan that would direct billions towards everything from roads and bridges to clean energy and broadband. Administration officials said the budget request was "complimentary" to that bill. Biden's budget proposal released Friday covers only discretionary spending, which accounts for about a quarter of total federal spending. The full budget, which will include non-discretionary spending like Social Security and Medicare, as well as tax proposals, is set to be released later this spring. Funding for areas outside of defense, like education and public health, lagged behind its historical levels under the Trump administration. The $769 billion for non-defense spending Biden is proposing would be a 16 percent increase over 2021 enacted levels and would account for about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product — roughly the historic average over the last 30 years, an administration official said. Biden's proposal sets aside $753 billion for all national defense programs across the government, a 1.7 percent increase over fiscal 2021. While an increase, that's a shift from the Trump administration, which heavily prioritized military spending. Non-defense discretionary spending has been shrinking relative to the overall economy for the past decade because of budget caps imposed by Congress a decade ago. Biden wants to end gun-maker liability protections. That could sink the industry, advocates say. Some Democrats in Congress had been pressing for Biden to cut defense spending in his first budget proposal. When accounting for inflation, Biden's $715 billion funding for the Defense Department would amount to a slight decrease in real world dollars. The budget outline was expected last week, but administration officials said the budget process was delayed because Trump administration officials refused to fully cooperate during the transition. Biden is also without a confirmed budget director after his nominee Neera Tanden withdrew from consideration after it appeared she didn't have the votes to get confirmed. The office is being run by acting director Shalanda Young. Among the areas administration officials highlighted in the budget included an increase of $3.9 billion to fight the opioid epidemic, $30.4 billion for housing vouchers aimed at reducing homelessness, and a total of $8.7 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prepare for future public health crises. The budget would also include $2.1 billion to the Justice Department to address gun violence, representing an increase of $232 million, and $1 billion to the Justice Department for Violence Against Women Act programs, nearly double the 2021 level. To address the root causes of migration that has caused an influx of immigrants to the Southern Border in recent months, Biden's budget allocates $861 billion as a "first step toward a four-year commitment." The Budget Control Act imposed budget limits through 2021 and included $1.2 trillion in automatically scheduled cuts to defense and non-defense discretionary spending to encourage Republicans and Democrats to reach a larger deal on taxes and spending to avert them.
CDC scientists say their investigation into a rare blood clotting issue linked to the J&J Covid-19 vaccine has identified 28 cases. The median age of the patients was 40, ranging from 18 to 59 years old. Women who were 30 to 39 years old accounted for the biggest risk group.	CDC scientists say their investigation into a rare blood clotting issue linked to the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine has identified 28 people who developed the potentially life threatening blockages — three of whom have died. The Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on April 13 asked states to temporarily halt using J&J's vaccine "out of an abundance of caution" while it investigated six women, ages 18 to 48, who developed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or CVST, in combination with low blood platelets within about two weeks of receiving the shot. They recommended resuming use of the shot 10 days later after the CDC determined that the benefits of the inoculations outweighed their risks. CVST is a form of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS, which are blood clots with a low platelet count that puts patients at risk for a stroke. Platelets actually help the blood to clot. CDC official Dr. Tom Shimabukuro said Wednesday that four of the 28 people with TTS remained in the hospital as of May 7, one of whom was in the ICU, and two have been discharged to a post-acute care facility. The remaining 19 patients have all been discharged, he said during a presentation to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The panel voted earlier in the day to recommend the Pfizer - BioNTech vaccine for use in 12- to 15-year olds. The median age of the patients with TTS was 40, ranging from 18 to 59 years old. Women who were 30 to 39 years old accounted for the biggest risk group. All of the patients received the J&J shot before the pause on April 13. Out of the 28 TTS cases, 19 affected the brain with 10 of those patients suffering from a cerebral hemorrhage, Shimabukuro said. The other clots formed in the lower extremities, pulmonary arteries or other areas of the body.
Dr. Anthony Fauci said a study showed that after one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, people with prior coronavirus infections had better immune responses against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. "Vaccines are highly efficacious," Fauci said during a White House Covid briefing.	People who have had Covid-19 and later got vaccinated may have more protection against highly contagious variants, White House chief medical officer Dr. Anthony Fauci said Wednesday. Fauci cited a study published in late April that found that after one dose of the Pfizer - BioNTech vaccine, people with prior coronavirus infections had better immune responses against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, the variants first identified in the U.K. and South Africa, compared with those who hadn't had Covid. He cited an additional study, which was published online and not yet peer-reviewed, that found people with prior infections who were later boosted with two doses of an mRNA vaccine had "increased protection" protection against variants. The studies provide more evidence on the benefits of getting vaccinated, Fauci said. "Vaccines are highly efficacious," Fauci said during a White House Covid briefing. "They are better than the response you get from natural infection." His comments come amid the Biden administration's push to get 70% of U.S. adults partially vaccinated and 160 million adults fully vaccinated by the Fourth of July, a date the administration hopes will be a turning point in the pandemic. In recent weeks, the pace of individuals receiving their first vaccine doses has fallen , though U.S. health officials say they are working to improve access to the shots as well as encourage more hesitant Americans to get vaccinated. Earlier Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a new report that projected Covid-19 cases would surge through May before sharply declining by July as vaccinations drive down infections. Highly contagious variants, namely the highly contagious B.1.1.7 first identified in the U.K., remain a wild card, U.S. health officials said, urging Americans to get vaccinated and practice pandemic safety measures. "We are seeing that our current vaccines are protecting against the contaminant variants circulating in the country. Simply put, the sooner we get more and more people vaccinated, the sooner we will all get back to normal,"  CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said during the press briefing.
J&J asked Covid vaccine rivals Pfizer and Moderna to join a study looking into the potential risk of blood clots, The Wall Street Journal reported. The two companies declined, according to the Journal.	Johnson & Johnson privately asked Covid-19 vaccine rivals Pfizer and Moderna to join a study looking into the potential risk of blood clots but the companies declined, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday , citing people familiar with the matter. Executives at Pfizer and Moderna said their vaccines appeared safe and they didn't see the need to duplicate the efforts of regulators and companies already looking into the rare blood clot issue, according to the Journal report. Only AstraZeneca , whose vaccine has also raised concerns from regulators over blood clots, agreed to join the effort, the Journal said. CNBC has reached out to the four companies for comment. On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised states to temporarily pause the use of J&J's vaccine "out of an abundance of caution" after six women developed a rare but potentially life-threatening blood clotting disorder that left one dead and one in critical condition. The women developed the condition known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or CVST, within about two weeks of receiving the shot, U.S. health officials told reporters. CVST is a rare form of a stroke that happens when a blood clot forms in the brain's venous sinuses. It can eventually leak blood into the brain tissues and cause a hemorrhage. A CDC panel on Wednesday decided to postpone a decision on the use of J&J's vaccine while officials investigate the cases. Read the full Wall Street Journal report here.
As President Joe Biden tries to curry favor for a corporate tax hike, the administration has other ways it could fund a $2 trillion infrastructure plan. Biden could return to a campaign promise to compel the country's wealthiest households to contribute more in income taxes. He could also try to increase the federal gasoline tax, create a so-called mileage tax, or better monetize the U.S. electrical grid. Biden will meet with lawmakers from both parties Monday to kick off negotiations in earnest.	As President Joe Biden attempts to curry favor for his proposed corporate tax hike, the administration still has other ways it could try to fund and finance its $2 trillion infrastructure legislation. Biden could decide, for example, to return to a campaign promise to ask the country's wealthiest households to contribute more in personal income taxes or lobby to increase the federal gasoline tax. Other funding ideas include a so-called mileage tax and better monetization of the U.S. electrical grid. Democrats may ultimately lean on a special class of bonds to finance their spending plans despite objections from the GOP and concerns about the growing national debt. While both parties agree that the U.S. is in dire need of infrastructure repair, the GOP has thus far opposed the Biden plan for funding too many projects beyond what they consider critical infrastructure. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., has dubbed the American Jobs Plan a "Trojan horse" for liberal policies, while others have balked at the hundreds of billions of dollars earmarked for items other than improvements to roads, bridges, airports and public transit. Those agenda items, coupled with the administration's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package signed in March, have convinced Republicans and some moderate Democrats that the White House should seek ways to pay for the plan upfront with new taxes. Partially to quell funding concerns, Biden has offered a "Made In America" tax plan that includes hiking the corporate tax rate to 28% and removing incentives for corporations to send factories and profits offshore. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced Wednesday that the tax plan would generate about $2.5 trillion over 15 years. That proposal, however, amounts to a partial rollback of former President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts and is already opposed by Republicans and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Those concerned about a corporate tax hike say increasing the rate could hinder a fragile economic recovery and make the U.S. a less attractive place for businesses to build factories and hire workers. Biden, in a speech addressing infrastructure Wednesday, rejected those concerns but said he was open to negotiating on the corporate tax rate. He will meet with Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Monday to kick off infrastructure negotiations in earnest. "We've got to pay for this," Biden said Wednesday, noting that there are "many other ways we can do it." To Tony Fratto, opposition to an infrastructure plan based on cost concerns doesn't make much sense. Infrastructure "generates an economic return, and so why exactly are we constraining ourselves with the concept of putting pain on certain segments of the economy?" Fratto, a Treasury official in the George W. Bush administration, said Friday. With U.S. interest rates still historically low, Fratto argued that it would not take long for the economic benefits generated by faster, more efficient transit to pay for the government's initial spending. "You can make a very strong case to borrow the money and pay it back over time on the expected returns," he added. "We have failed to invest in all of the infrastructure needs that this country has by this fictional argument that it must be paid for for us to do it." A study published by the Wharton School this week found that Biden's infrastructure plan would actually reduce U.S. debt by 6.4% in 2050 relative to current law. If lawmakers ultimately develop an appetite for debt, the White House could try to resurrect a class of special municipal bonds known as Build America Bonds that allow states and counties to float debt with interest costs subsidized by the federal government. A possible alternative to a corporate tax hike would be adjustments to individual income taxes, as Biden proposed during his 2020 campaign. Then-candidate Biden proposed raising the top individual income tax rate to 39.6% from its current level of 37%. He also called for the capital gains rate to rise to 39.6% for taxpayers with income over $1 million. Currently, wealthy investors face long-term capital gains rates of up to 20%. Despite demanding during the campaign that the wealthiest Americans pay more as a percentage of their income, Biden has yet to say when he plans to increase income tax rates. However, the president doubled down on a red line in his speech Wednesday. "I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year," Biden said. "If others have ideas out there on how to pay for this investment without violating that rule, they should come forward. There's all kinds of opportunities." Another possible revenue generator could be an increase in the federal government's gas tax. That tax was last raised in late 1993 and is not indexed to inflation, meaning that its effective value has eroded over the last 27-plus years. The federal government currently collects 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline sold in the U.S. and 24.4 cents per gallon of diesel fuel. That revenue, which totaled $36.4 billion in fiscal 2016, is used by the Federal Highway Trust Fund, which funds road construction and other surface transportation projects. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNBC last month that the gasoline tax may soon be an outdated mechanism to raise significant revenue as more Americans switch to electric vehicles and fuel-efficient cars. Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a supporter of a far-smaller infrastructure bill , told "Fox News Sunday" that funding for repairs to the nation's roads and bridges needs to evolve over time. "As we have more electric vehicles, we're going to have to figure out some way that those electric vehicles pay their fair share," he said Sunday. "We may even have to figure out a different way that driverless vehicles pay for the increased kind of monitoring that needs to happen with the highway system itself you have with that." States, too, have for years imposed their own taxes on the sale of gasoline. In 2019, the Republican governors of Ohio, Alabama and Arkansas signed fuel tax hikes in an effort to help fund road repair, and in 2018, Michigan's Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, won election after campaigning on the slogan "Fix the Damn Roads." However, several Republican senators opposed increasing the gas tax when former President Donald Trump sought to make a push on infrastructure. As of Jan. 1, total state taxes and fees on gasoline averaged 30.06 cents per gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Buttigieg said a mileage tax could be a more attractive option than a gas tax for lawmakers who support the idea that consumers should pay for infrastructure based on how often they use it. "I'm hearing a lot of appetite to make sure that there are sustainable funding streams," the Transportation secretary said in March. A mileage tax "shows a lot of promise if we believe in that so-called user-pays principle: The idea that part of how we pay for roads is you pay based on how much you drive." The mileage tax is a relatively new idea, and so there are a few barriers to it becoming a reality in the near term. Questions remain over how to record the distances individuals travel, how and where fees would be collected, and whether the introduction of such a tax would disproportionately impact low-income or rural communities that rely on cars to get to work. Still, a vehicle miles tax, or VMT, does enjoy bipartisan support on the key House Transportation and Infrastructure committee. Both Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., and Ranking Member Sam Graves, R-Mo., have voiced support for VMT measures in the past. "It's become abundantly clear that we need to move on from the gas tax and diesel tax as the primary means of building infrastructure," Graves wrote in March . "Although critics will say that we're not ready for VMT, we've heard that same argument for too long. The Highway Trust Fund continues to lose more and more revenue because not all users are paying their fair share given increased fuel efficiency and electric vehicle technology." Fratto suggested the federal government could look to tax Americans' electricity consumption as a greater percentage of the U.S. population switches to electric vehicles. That could take the form of at-home grid use or fees levied at charging stations akin to a gas tax for petroleum-powered cars. That may be an appealing option in the future, Fratto said, since utility companies have already established and installed ways to keep track of and charge for the energy consumed by each household. "There are lots of other user fees that we have across all these systems that we could use, including the electricity sector," the former Treasury official said. "We can take some fee off the use of the grid in order to pay back the federal government for its investment in those areas." "You could easily attach a fee that power companies would have to pay, and the same goes for the availability of electricity," he added. Ultimately, how Biden finances his plan and the degree to which he relies on a corporate tax hike will depend on how much he wants bipartisan support from a Republican Party that is calling for him to scale back his ambitions and focus on a package closer to $600 billion. The president and the Democratic leadership in Congress could opt to use the reconciliation process, as they did for the Covid relief bill, which would allow them to pass the legislation with a simple majority in the evenly divided Senate. In that case, Biden could bypass Republican objections and he would play largely to an audience of one in the Senate — Sen. Joe Manchin. Though the conservative West Virginia Democrat opposes raising the corporate rate to 28% , he might be willing to meet Biden in the middle. "As the bill exists today, it needs to be changed," Manchin told Hoppy Kercheval, the host of West Virginia Metro News' "Talkline" show. "I think [the corporate rate] should have never been under 25%, that's the worldwide average. And that's what basically every corporation would have told you was fair."
Out of more than 700 million Covid-19 vaccine doses administered globally, more than 87% have gone to wealthier countries, according to the WHO. Low-income countries have received just 0.2%, a top WHO official said at a press briefing Friday. On average, 1 in 4 people in high-income countries have received a coronavirus vaccine, compared with just 1 in more than 500 in low-income countries.	Wealthy countries have received the vast majority of the world's supply of Covid-19 vaccine doses, while poor countries have obtained less than 1%, the World Health Organization said at a press briefing Friday. Of the 700 million vaccine doses that have been distributed across the globe, "over 87% have gone to high-income or upper- and middle-income countries, while low-income countries have received just 0.2%," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. On average, 1 in 4 people in high-income countries have received a coronavirus vaccine, compared with just 1 in more than 500 in low-income countries, according to Tedros. "There remains a shocking imbalance in the global distribution of vaccines," he said. Tedros said that there is a shortage of doses for COVAX, a global alliance aiming to provide poor nations with coronavirus vaccines. "We understand that some countries and companies plan to do their own bilateral vaccine donations, bypassing COVAX for their own political or commercial reasons," Tedros said. "These bilateral arrangements run the risk of fanning the flames of vaccine inequity." Tedros said COVAX partners — including the WHO, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance — are pursuing strategies to accelerate production and supply. The alliance is seeking donations from countries with surplus vaccine supply, expediting review of more vaccines and discussing ways to expand global manufacturing capacity with several countries, Tedros and Gavi CEO Dr. Seth Berkley said.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals said it will ask the FDA to allow its Covid-19 antibody therapy to be used as a preventative treatment. The company said in a phase three clinical trial the drug reduced the risk of symptomatic infections in individuals by 81%. The drug is already authorized to treat adults with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 and pediatric patients at least 12 years of age who have tested positive for the virus and are at high risk of severe disease.	Regeneron Pharmaceuticals said Monday it will ask the Food and Drug Administration to allow its Covid-19 antibody therapy to be used as a preventative treatment. The therapy, which was given to former President Donald Trump shortly after he was diagnosed with Covid-19 last year, has already been authorized by the FDA to treat adults with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 and pediatric patients at least 12 years of age who have tested positive for the virus and are at high risk of severe disease. Regeneron said it is seeking to expand the use of its treatment in the U.S. after a phase three clinical trial, jointly run by the National Institutes of Health, found the drug reduced the risk of symptomatic infections in individuals by 81%. The company also said people who were symptomatic and were treated with the drug resolved their symptoms, on average, two weeks faster than those who received a placebo. "With more than 60,000 Americans continuing to be diagnosed with COVID-19 every day, the REGEN-COV antibody cocktail may help provide immediate protection to unvaccinated people who are exposed to the virus," Dr. George Yancopoulos, president and chief scientific officer at Regeneron, said in a press release. The trial enrolled 1,505 people who were not infected with the virus but lived in the same household with someone who recently tested positive. Participants received either one dose of Regeneron's therapy or a placebo. The company said 41% of the people in the trial were Hispanic and 9% were Black. In addition, 33% of the participants were obese and 38% were age 50 and older, according to the company. Regeneron's therapy is part of a class of treatments known as monoclonal antibodies, which are made to act as immune cells and fight infections. Monoclonal antibody treatments gained widespread attention after news that Trump received Regeneron's drug in October. In recent months, public health officials have grown concerned emerging, highly contagious coronavirus variants could pose threats to existing monoclonal antibodies on the market. But Dr. Myron Cohen, who leads the monoclonal antibody efforts for the NIH-sponsored COVID Prevention Network, said the drug has shown to retain its potency against new strains. While the world's attention has shifted to administering Covid-19 vaccines, health experts say treatments are also critically important to ending the pandemic, which has infected more than 31.1 million Americans and killed at least 561,800 in a little over a year, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer urged residents to restrict activities as a surge in Covid-19 cases overwhelms the state's public health system. The governor asked high schools to suspend in-person classes, youth sports programs to pause in-person activities and residents to avoid in-person dining for the next two weeks. The state health department is tracking 991 Covid outbreaks across Michigan, Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun said.	Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer urged high schools to temporarily halt in-person learning and residents to restrict their activities as a surge in Covid-19 cases overwhelms the state's public health system. The governor also asked schools to voluntarily suspend youth sports games and practices and residents to avoid in-person dining for the next two weeks. "To be very clear, these are not orders, mandates or requirements," Whitmer said at a news conference Friday. "A year in, we all know what works and this has to be a team effort. We have to do this together. Lives depend on it." Covid-19 infections have surged across the state in recent weeks, approaching the state's pandemic high set in the fall at an average of 7,226 new cases per day over the last week — a 23% jump over the previous week, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The state health department is currently tracking 991 Covid outbreaks across Michigan, the state's Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun said at the news briefing. "Because we are seeing so many cases a day, our public health system is overwhelmed. We are not able to get information on many cases, nor are we able to identify their close contacts. We don't know where all the cases or outbreaks are, and what we do know is likely an undercount," Khaldun said. Whitmer and Khaldun urged all Michiganders to wear masks, social distance, wash their hands, stay home and get vaccinated. The coronavirus surge in Michigan comes as the highly infectious B.1.1.7 variant first identified in the U.K. has become the most common Covid strain in the U.S. Between January and March, the state saw 291 outbreaks stemming from youth sports teams alone that involved at least 1,091 people, Khaldun said. "The numbers show young people are not impervious to this virus, as we've seen a lot of cases among teens and young adult Michiganders," Whitmer said. State health officials have seen 58 outbreaks in restaurant and retail settings alone just in the past week, according to Khaldun. "Just because something is open, doesn't mean it is safe or that you should do it," Khaldun said. "Indoor dining is one of the riskiest things you can do in this pandemic." Whitmer also urged the federal government to create a vaccination surge program to deploy Covid-19 vaccine doses to hot spots. "Today it's Michigan and the Midwest, tomorrow it could be another section of our country," Whitmer said.
The WHO said the trajectory of the pandemic is now "growing exponentially" at more than 4.4 million new Covid-19 cases. Maria Van Kerkhove, the agency's technical lead for Covid-19, said "we're in a critical point of the pandemic." "This is not the situation we want to be in 16 months into a pandemic where we have proven control measures," she said.	The World Health Organization said Monday the trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic is now "growing exponentially," with more than 4.4 million new Covid-19 cases reported over the last week. Maria Van Kerkhove, the agency's technical lead for Covid-19, said "we're in a critical point of the pandemic," as some countries ease restrictions even as new cases per week are more than eight times higher than a year ago. "This is not the situation we want to be in 16 months into a pandemic where we have proven control measures. It is the time right now where everyone has to take stock and have a reality check of what we need to be doing," she said during a press briefing. "Vaccines and vaccinations are coming online, but they aren't here yet in every part of the world." Covid-19 cases climbed by 9% across the globe last week — the seventh consecutive weekly increase — and deaths jumped 5%, she said, asking governments to support their citizens in implementing pandemic safety measures. Last month, WHO officials warned of a steady rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths, urging people to stick with mask mandates and social distancing rules as the world enters a critical phase of the pandemic. The virus is "stronger, it's faster" with the emergence of new variants that spread more easily and are more deadly than the original wild strain of the virus, Dr. Mike Ryan, the head of the WHO's health emergencies program, said March 31 . "We're all struggling" with and sick of restrictive lockdowns, he said. India has overtaken Brazil as the second worst-infected country behind the United States after Covid-19 cases continued to surge across India where a double-mutant variant researchers say could be more contagious has emerged and is rapidly spreading. In the U.S., B.1.1.7, the highly contagious coronavirus variant first identified in the United Kingdom i s now the most common strain circulating , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said last week. Hospitals are also seeing a rise in young people being admitted, she said. Walensky said the U.S. needs to accelerate its vaccination efforts, which are averaging about 3.1 million shots per day. "We must continue to vaccinate as many Americans as we can each day," Walensky said, adding it will cause new cases and deaths to decline. The WHO urged the public and world leaders to continue to practice safety measures, including social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands and avoiding crowded spaces.
Violence has plagued the streets of Belfast in recent weeks, and dozens of police officers have been injured amid attacks with petrol bombs, vehicles and rocks. The renewed unrest comes as Ireland and the U.K. marked the 23rd anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement — a historic truce which brought an end to three decades of sectarian violence. The origins of the protests have been attributed in part to resentment among the British loyalist community at the Northern Ireland Protocol – part of the treaty that saw the U.K. leave the EU.	LONDON — Tensions have erupted in Northern Ireland once again, as U.K. and Irish leaders attempt to preserve a long-standing peace deal in the region. Violence has plagued the streets of Belfast for the past week and dozens of police officers have been injured amid attacks with petrol bombs, vehicles and rocks. The renewed unrest comes as Ireland and the U.K. marked the 23rd anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement — a historic truce which brought an end to three decades of sectarian violence. Now, hostilities have come to a head as leaders scramble to agree on new trade rules between the U.K. and European Union without undermining this agreement. The U.K. – which includes Northern Ireland – left the EU in 2020, whereas the Republic of Ireland remains a member of the union. The British and Irish prime ministers, as well as Northern Irish lawmakers from across the political divide, have condemned the violence and called for calm. Recent rioting on the streets of Belfast has seen primarily Protestant pro-British unionist groups clash with mainly Catholic Irish republicans. The origins of the protests have been attributed in part to resentment among the British loyalist community at the Northern Ireland Protocol – part of the treaty that saw the U.K. leave the EU. However, the police's recent decision not to prosecute senior lawmakers from Irish republican party Sinn Fein for breaking Covid rules, in order to attend the funeral of high-profile former Irish Republican Army member Bobby Storey, has also been cited as lighting the tinderbox. Paramilitary groups and criminal factions have seized upon the discontent to stoke sectarian violence. Many of those arrested have been minors, some as young as 13, and Northern Irish Children's Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma has said adults persuading young people to commit violence and vandalism is tantamount to "child abuse." Former Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern told CNBC Monday that the tensions had been simmering since last year, but said peace commitments from politicians on both sides meant it was unlikely to become a long-term issue. However, he voiced some concern that the "marching season," a period of regular marches by Protestant groups between April to August, will be more febrile in the wake of the recent clashes. The Good Friday Agreement, a pair of accords signed on April 10, 1998, brought an end to nearly three decades of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland, known as The Troubles. The fact that both the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland were members of the EU was also important and enabled a blurring of borders between the two. However, the U.K.'s departure from the EU has been accused of undermining the Good Friday Agreement. It mandates either an "Irish Sea border," between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K., or a "hard border" separating Northern Ireland from the Republic of Ireland, which would enrage Irish nationalists. The Northern Ireland Protocol creates the former – a distinction between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. – and it's angered the unionist community, which identify as British. Prior to winning election, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson swore that no government of his would agree to any deal with the EU that saw a customs border for trade crossing the Irish Sea. However, he reneged on that promise within weeks of taking office, leaving unionists feeling disenfranchised and betrayed by London. U.K. and EU leaders are continuing to finalize the application of trade rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol, although the Financial Times reported Sunday that both sides were optimistic on progress. Despite the fact that it is not yet fully implemented, goods arriving into Northern Ireland were subjected to EU customs checks in January for the first time. Ahern suggested that British and European lawmakers will reach an agreement on the border issue, which has caused trade and supply chain disruption, but that might not be enough to put the genie back in the bottle in the short term. "The million dollar question is: 'Will that by itself remove the perception that is now ingrained into loyalists that there still is a border down the Irish Sea, that there is this mystical line down the Irish Sea?' That's the bit that worries me," Ahern said. Among the common institutions enshrined within the Good Friday Agreement was the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. However, Ahern highlighted that the group has not met since the governments of Johnson and Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin took office. "I see both the government (in Ireland) and the government of the U.K. saying we must implement the Good Friday Agreement ... But the one mechanism that's in the Agreement that both of them have responsibility for is the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, and they haven't met since either government has been elected," he said. British and European leaders are now scrambling to establish a way of implementing the Protocol that placates both sides of Northern Ireland's sectarian divide. DBRS Morningstar, a global credit ratings agency, said cooler heads will likely prevail, but the Irish Protocol is unlikely to be fundamentally reworked since it is the only available alternative to a hard border across the island of Ireland. "A temporary extension of waivers on post-Brexit checks is likely and could buy time. However, permanent solutions will need to be found that reduce or eliminate trade friction along the Irish Sea while not compromising the EU's single market," Jason Graffan and Nichola James said in a recent note. "If these challenges are left unaddressed or if relations are poorly managed, long-standing security risks to the island of Ireland will persist."
A student opened fire on officers responding to a report of a possible gunman at a Tennessee high school Monday, and police shot back and killed him, authorities said. The student died at the school, and the officer was taken into surgery after being shot at least once in the upper leg, authorities said. Police found the student in a bathroom at Austin-East Magnet High School in Knoxville, a city about 180 miles (290 kilometers) east of Nashville, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director David B. Rausch said at a news conference.	A student opened fire on officers responding to a report of a possible gunman at a Tennessee high school Monday, and police shot back and killed him, authorities said. The shooting wounded an officer and comes as the community reels from off-campus gun violence that has left three other students dead this year. Police found the student in a bathroom at Austin-East Magnet High School in Knoxville, a city about 180 miles (290 kilometers) east of Nashville, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director David B. Rausch said at a news conference. They ordered the student to come out, but he wouldn't comply, and that's when he reportedly opened fire, Rausch said. Police fired back. The student died at the school, and the officer was taken into surgery after being shot at least once in the upper leg, authorities said. The officer was expected to recover, and no one else was hurt. It wasn't yet clear why the student brought a gun to school or why he fired at officers. "It's a sad day for Knoxville, and it's tough for Austin-East," Rausch said. Asked about the overwhelming police response to a call that came in just before afternoon dismissal, Knoxville Police Chief Eve Thomas said, "We have a student, a school incident. It's our worst fear, an active shooter in a school." The shooting comes as more classrooms are reopening to students after months of remote learning during the coronavirus pandemic, which cut down the number of mass killings in the U.S. The nation has seen series of mass shootings in recent weeks, including eight people killed at three Atlanta-area massage businesses on March 16 and 10 people killed at Colorado supermarket on March 22. Knox County Schools restarted in-person learning in January, but Austin-East Magnet High School went back to virtual instruction briefly in February after the spate of shooting deaths of students. The school will be closed again Tuesday and Wednesday. Speaking outside a hospital, Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon told news station WATE-TV that she spoke with the wounded officer and he was conscious and in good spirits. Kincannon, a former Knox County Schools board president, spoke at a February press conference about the gun violence that took the lives of three Austin-East students less than three weeks apart this year. Two of the victims were 15, and the other was 16. "I know that school is a safe place," Kincannon said at that time, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel. "It's a place where people are learning. ... The issues with violence are happening in the community, and it's affecting kids when they're outside of the school. That's why we are focusing our efforts to protect the innocent, protect the school, protect the children and students and staff." The newspaper reported that the school was adding three school resource officers and stepping up patrols around dismissal time. State Rep. Sam McKenzie, who represents the district and went to the school, said in a statement: "I am at a loss to describe my sadness as yet another horrific act of gun violence has happened in my community," urging people to "reclaim the sanctity of our beloved neighborhood." "This is the fourth unnecessary shooting involving the Austin East community this year and we must make sure we take every step and make every effort to prevent these tragedies from continuing to occur," McKenzie's statement said. Gov. Bill Lee mentioned the shooting at a Monday news conference but said he had little information. "I just wanted to make reference to that and ask, for those who are watching, online or otherwise, to pray for that situation and for the families and the victims that might be affected by that in our state," he said. Last week, the Republican governor signed legislation that will make Tennessee the latest state to allow most adults 21 and older to carry handguns — openly or concealed — without first clearing a background check and training. Lee backed the legislation over objections from law enforcement groups, who argued that the state's existing permit system provided an important safeguard for knowing who should or shouldn't be carrying a gun. When asked earlier this year whether recent mass shootings in Georgia, Colorado and others gave him any concern about timing, Lee said the increased penalties mean that "we in fact will be strengthening laws that would help prevent gun crimes in the future."
The coronavirus variant first discovered in South Africa is able to evade some of the protection of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, according to a new Israeli study. The researchers found the prevalence of B.1.351 among patients who received two doses of the vaccine was about eight times higher than those who were unvaccinated. The researchers in the study noted the main caveat of the study was the small sample size.	The coronavirus variant first discovered in South Africa is able to evade some of the protection of the Pfizer - BioNTech vaccine, according to a new Israeli study , which has not yet been peer-reviewed. Researchers at Tel Aviv University and Clalit, the largest health-care organization in Israel, examined nearly 400 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 after receiving at least one dose of the vaccine. They compared them to the same number of people who were infected and unvaccinated. The researchers found the prevalence of the variant from South Africa, known as B.1.351, among patients who received two doses of the vaccine was about eight times higher than those who were unvaccinated. The data, published online over the weekend, suggest the B.1.351 is better able to "break through" the protection of the vaccine than the original strain, the researchers wrote in the study. "Based on patterns in the general population, we would have expected just one case of the South African variant, but we saw eight," Professor Adi Stern, who headed the research, told The Times of Israel. "We can say it's less effective, but more research is needed to establish exactly how much." CNBC has reached out to Pfizer for comment on the study. The new data comes as public health officials grow concerned that highly contagious variants, which studies have shown can reduce the effectiveness of vaccines, could stall the world's progress on the pandemic. Last month, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky issued a dire warning, telling reporters that she worried the United States is facing great peril as variants spread and daily Covid-19 cases begin to rebound once again, threatening to send more people to the hospital. "I'm going to pause here, I'm going to lose the script, and I'm going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom," she said March 29 . "We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope, but right now I'm scared." Israel launched its national vaccination campaign in December prioritizing people 60 and older, health-care workers, and people with underlying health issues. By February, it was leading the world in vaccinations per capita, inoculating millions of its citizens against the virus. In January, Pfizer and the Israeli Ministry of Health entered into a collaboration agreement to monitor the real-world impact of its vaccine. The researchers noted the main caveat of the study was the small sample size. B.1.351 made up only about 1% of all Covid-19 cases, they said. B.1.1.7, the variant identified in the U.K., is more prevalent. As variants spread, drugmakers said they are testing whether a third dose would offer more protection. In February, Pfizer and BioNTech said they were testing a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine to better understand the immune response against new variants of the virus.
More Americans will likely refuse to get J&J's Covid-19 vaccine after U.S. health regulators said six women developed a rare blood-clotting disorder, experts on public health and vaccines told CNBC on Tuesday. People were already skeptical about vaccines before the coronavirus emerged in December 2019. Some Americans were also hesitant to get the J&J vaccine in particular because they perceived it as inferior to Pfizer's and Moderna's. The warning from U.S. officials to states is likely to fuel more hesitancy in taking J&J's shot and other vaccines, threatening to stall the pandemic recovery.	More Americans will likely refuse to get Johnson & Johnson 's Covid-19 vaccine after U.S. health regulators said six women developed a rare blood-clotting disorder that left one dead and another in critical condition, experts on public health and vaccines told CNBC on Tuesday. The Food and Drug Administration asked states early Tuesday to temporarily halt using J&J's single-shot vaccine "out of an abundance of caution" after six women, ages 18 to 48, out of the roughly 6.9 million people who received the shot developed a blood-clotting disorder known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or CVST. All of the women developed the condition, which occurs when a blood clot forms in the brain's venous sinuses, preventing blood from draining out of the brain back to the heart, within about two weeks of receiving the shot, health officials told reporters on a call. "For people who recently got the vaccine within the last couple weeks, they should be aware to look for any symptoms," Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a press briefing Tuesday. "If you've received the vaccine and developed severe headaches, abdominal pain, leg pain or shortness of breath, you should contact your health-care provider and seek medical treatment." Shortly after the FDA issued the warning, more than a dozen states as well as some pharmacies took steps to halt inoculations with J&J's vaccine, some replacing scheduled appointments with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Some doctors say they're already fielding calls from worried patients. People were already skeptical about vaccines before the coronavirus emerged as a new pathogen in China in December 2019, infecting more than 31.2 million Americans and killing at least 562,718 in a little over a year. The warning from U.S. health officials to states is likely to fuel even more hesitancy in taking J&J's shot and the other vaccines, threatening to stall the nation's recovery from the pandemic, health experts told CNBC. "Sadly, it will likely exacerbate those who have some degree of hesitancy towards receiving a vaccine," said Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist who has sat on several drug data and safety monitoring boards. "Senior public health officials have to continue to be open, honest, transparent and most importantly contextualize that this is low risk." The goal, according to President Joe Biden's chief medical advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci, is to vaccinate between 70% and 85% of the U.S. population — or roughly 232 million to 281 million people — to achieve herd immunity and suppress the pandemic. So far, more than 120 million Americans, or 36% of the total U.S. population, have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to data compiled by the CDC. Roughly 74 million Americans, or 22% of the total U.S. population, are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Kids under age 16 are not yet authorized in the U.S. to take the shots, and some adults will likely refuse to get any vaccine. "This throws a wrench into the plans. It will slow down the rollout," said Dr. Jeffrey Kahn, director of the Berman Institute of Bioethics at Johns Hopkins University. "People will say, 'I don't want that one, I want one of the others that doesn't have that problem,' even if it's an extraordinarily rare event." Some Americans, especially in Black, Hispanic and rural communities , were already hesitant to get the J&J vaccine in particular because they perceived it as inferior to Pfizer's and Moderna's. The J&J shot, which is highly effective, especially against severe disease, demonstrated 72% effectiveness in the U.S. in protecting against Covid about a month after the inoculation. That compares with the roughly 95% efficacy of Pfizer's and Moderna's two-dose vaccines. Single-dose vaccines such as J&J's were crucial to "getting to communities where a two-dose regimen wasn't practical or really even possible," Kahn said. U.S. health officials were largely using J&J's vaccine to reach poorer urban and rural areas where residents couldn't easily get to a vaccine clinic or didn't have reliable internet access. "Those communities also are the ones most severely affected by Covid," Kahn said. "Pausing the use of J&J [is] a blow to doing that effectively and quickly." Dr. Stephen Schrantz, who was part of the team that led a J&J vaccine trial at the University of Chicago Medicine, said he already had patients who did not want the J&J vaccine and said the news will give them further evidence to say, "See, I told you." "I suspect vaccine rollout and uptake will slow down, there will be a migration away from the J&J vaccine, even if the CDC and FDA conclude there is not a causal relationship," he said. "And as mask-wearing wanes we may begin to see more cases, such as we have in Michigan, show up elsewhere." Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who sits on Pfizer's board, predicted the move will "fuel the hesitancy" of some people to get a Covid vaccine. "Even if there isn't a causal relationship, even if this is exceedingly rare, I think we're going to see that whole conversation now get ignited on social media," he told CNBC in an interview . Dr. Purvi Parikh, a specialist in infectious disease allergy and immunology at NYU Langone Health, on Tuesday called the FDA warning a "double-edged sword," saying it will likely add concerns to already hesitant Americans. She also said she has already gotten "panicked calls" from her own patients about the J&J vaccine. "But if anything, again, I want to reiterate: This only gives me more faith in our system because those safety checks and balances are working. So hopefully it gives some people peace of mind," she added on "Squawk on the Street." "Again, just to look at the big picture, the benefits still far outweigh the risks of this vaccination ." Dr. Archana Chatterjee, pediatric infectious diseases specialist and member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, echoed Parikh's remark. She added that there was nothing "unusual" in the way U.S. health regulators addressed the issue. "This is a normal procedure that occurs," she said. "But obviously, anytime that serious adverse events are reported about any vaccine that raises concerns in the public's mind," she added. "When you talk about vaccine confidence or vaccine hesitancy, could that have an impact? It's certainly possible." Dr. Paul Offit, another member of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, said he hopes Americans think about the issue "rationally," adding that the cases of blood clots appear to be extremely rare. He noted persuading folks in hard-to-reach communities could be a challenge. "It should be reassuring to people that officials are continuing to look [at the vaccine], even for rare side effects," he said. — CNBC's Kevin Stankiewicz contributed to this article.
The FDA is asking states to temporarily halt the use of J&J’s Covid-19 vaccine after six women in the U.S. developed a rare blood-clotting disorder. “I think this is going to be a blip on the calendar in terms of getting Americans vaccinated,” said Dr. Ashish Jha. “I don't think it's going to affect the timeline at all.” Jha explained that the cautionary measures were proof that “the system is working,” and that the government’s swift action may counter vaccine hesitancy.	America's temporary pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson 's single-dose Covid-19 vaccine will not interfere with President Joe Biden 's goal of getting the nation to some semblance of normalcy by Independence Day, the dean of Brown University's School of Public Health said Tuesday. "I think this is going to be a blip on the calendar in terms of getting Americans vaccinated," said Dr. Ashish Jha. "I don't think it's going to affect the timeline at all." Federal health agencies advised Tuesday that the U.S. should temporarily pause the use of J&J's single-dose vaccine after six women out of the roughly 6.9 million people who received the shot reported getting severe blood clots. The blood clots occurred in women between the ages of 18 and 48 . One woman died and another is in critical condition. They all developed symptoms 6 to 13 days after getting the shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration . Jha told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith" that the cautionary measures were proof that "the system is working," and that the government's swift action may counter vaccine hesitancy. "My hope is that it will actually build confidence in people that we don't take adverse events lightly, and that we investigate them, and that we really are making sure these vaccines are very, very safe." Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, reaffirmed that the pause comes "out of an abundance of caution" and that it will give health officials time to investigate. "You want to make sure that safety is the important issue here," Fauci said during a White House press briefing Tuesday. "We are totally aware that this is a very rare event. We want to get this worked out as quickly as we possibly can." Jha told host Shepard Smith that he "expects the pause to last days, not much longer," and echoed Fauci's assertion on the rarity of the blood clots. "The key point here is that this is an incredibly rare, adverse event," Jha said. "It's not going to affect very many people at all, and I just think, out of an abundance of caution, we're just taking a pause to  see what else we can find out about it."
White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the FDA's recommended pause will give U.S. health regulators the time they need to thoroughly investigate how six women developed a rare blood clotting disorder that left one dead. Fauci said officials at the FDA and the CDC want to see if there are "any clues" and "find some common denominators among the women who were involved."	White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday that the Food and Drug Administration's recommended pause on the use of Johnson & Johnson 's Covid-19 vaccine will give U.S. health regulators the time they need to thoroughly investigate how six women developed a rare blood clotting disorder that left one dead. Fauci said officials at the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention want to see if there are "any clues" and "find some common denominators among the women who were involved" that could be enabling the blood clotting disorder known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or CVST. He also said the recommended pause will make physicians aware of the issue. Doctors typically treat that type of blood clot with heparin, a blood thinner, but Fauci said that could be dangerous in this case and noted health officials recommended a different treatment. "If someone comes in with this really rather rare syndrome of thrombotic thrombocytopenia where you get thromboses, the most common way to treat that would be with heparin," Fauci said during a White House news briefing. "That would be a mistake in this situation because that could be dangerous and make the situation worse." Out of the 120 million people in the U.S. who have had at least one dose, roughly 6.9 million have received J&J's vaccine, Fauci said, noting that there haven't been any "red flag signals" from the Pfizer or Moderna Covid-19 vaccines that rely on MRNA technology in their shots. Out of the 6.9 million people who got the J&J jab, six developed blood clots, he said. "We are totally aware that this is a rare event. We want to get this worked out as quickly as we possibly can and that's why you see the word 'pause,' in other words, you want to hold off for a bit," Fauci said. "We want to leave that up to the FDA and the CDC to investigate this carefully. I don't think it was pulling the trigger too quickly." Fauci said the pause could last from a matter of days to a few weeks. The CDC will also convene a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Wednesday to further review the cases. During an earlier call Tuesday, Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said officials learned the blood clotting generally occurs about a week after vaccination, but not more than three weeks after, with a median time frame of nine days. "We know that for these vaccines, that for the first several days after vaccination, there are flu-like symptoms that can include headache," he said, adding that those are likely common side effects. "If someone presented to an emergency room with very severe headache or blood clots" doctors should ask whether they recently got a vaccine before putting together a plan of care. If the patient also has low platelets, doctors should consider that it may be related to the vaccine, he said. Marks told reporters that researchers haven't yet found a specific cause for the blood clotting in J&J vaccine recipients, but they believed it was similar to other adeno viral vector vaccines. "That is an immune response that occurs very, very rarely after some people receive the vaccine and that immune response leads to activation of the platelets and the extremely rare blood clots," he said. Correction: About 120 million people in the U.S. have received one dose of a vaccine. An earlier version mischaracterized the figure.
President Joe Biden's coronavirus czar said Wednesday the administration is working to accelerate doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines. Jeff Zients said the FDA's recommended pause on J&J's vaccine would not have a "significant impact" on the administration's vaccination program. The administration currently has deals with Pfizer and Moderna for 600 million doses combined, enough to inoculate 300 million Americans.	The Biden administration is working to accelerate doses of the Pfizer - BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines after U.S. health officials advised states to hold off on using Johnson & Johnson 's shot while regulators investigate a rare blood-clotting issue, a top U.S. official said Wednesday. Jeff Zients, the White House's Covid-19 coordinator, said the Food and Drug Administration's recommended pause on J&J's vaccine would not have a "significant impact" on the administration's vaccination program. On Tuesday, the FDA asked states to temporarily halt using J&J's vaccine "out of an abundance of caution" after six women developed a rare, but serious, blood-clotting disorder that left one dead and another in critical condition. Some medical experts and former health officials worried halting the use of the single-shot vaccine would disrupt the nation's massive vaccine campaign. Zients said the J&J vaccine makes up only 5% of the recorded shots in arms in the U.S. to date. Still, the U.S. government is "doing everything we can to accelerate the delivery" of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines as officials work to end the pandemic, he told reporters during a White House press briefing Wednesday. The administration currently has deals with Pfizer and Moderna for 600 million doses combined, enough to inoculate 300 million Americans, since those two vaccines require two shots given three to four weeks apart. Zients' comments come a day after Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said that his company has ramped up production of its two-shot vaccine and will be able to deliver 10% more doses to the U.S. by the end of May than it had previously agreed to produce — up to 220 million from 200 million. The ramped-up production is important, as some states, such as New York , said they will use Pfizer's vaccine in place of the J&J shot for appointments that had already been scheduled. Zients also said Moderna has indicated it is on track to meet its commitment for 300 million doses. – CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report.
A CDC advisory panel is expected to debate how J&J's Covid-19 vaccine should be used after six women developed a rare blood clotting disorder that left one dead. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will review data on the women who developed a rare blood-clotting disorder. The meeting is scheduled to run Wednesday from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET.

You can watch it by clicking here .] A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel is holding an emergency meeting Wednesday to debate how Johnson & Johnson 's Covid-19 vaccine should be used after six women developed a rare blood clotting disorder that left one dead. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will review data on the women, ages 18 to 48, who developed a rare blood-clotting disorder known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or CVST, according to a draft of the agenda . The women developed the condition within about two weeks of receiving the shot, U.S. health officials told reporters on Tuesday. The meeting is scheduled to run from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. ET. On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration asked states to temporarily halt using J&J's vaccine "out of an abundance of caution" following the reports of blood clots. Shortly after the FDA issued the warning, more than a dozen states, as well as some pharmacies, took steps to halt inoculations with J&J's vaccine, some replacing scheduled appointments with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday that the recommended pause on the use of the vaccine will give U.S. health regulators the time they need to thoroughly investigate the cases. Fauci said officials at the FDA and the CDC want to see if there are "any clues" and "find some common denominators among the women who were involved" that could be enabling the blood clotting disorder. "We are totally aware that this is a rare event.

"We want to leave that up to the FDA and the CDC to investigate this carefully. I don't think it was pulling the trigger too quickly." Out of the roughly 120 million people in the U.S. who have received at least one vaccine dose, roughly 6.9 million have received J&J's vaccine, Fauci said, noting that there haven't been any "red flag signals" from the Pfizer or Moderna Covid-19 vaccines that rely on mRNA technology in their shots. Out of the 6.9 million people who got the J&J jab, six developed blood clots, he said. J&J said in a statement that "no clear causal relationship" has been identified between the blood clots and the vaccine, adding it is working closely with regulators to assess the data. The company also said it would "proactively delay the rollout" of its vaccine in Europe and pause vaccinations in its clinical trials as health regulators review the cases. Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Tuesday that officials learned the blood clotting generally occurs about a week after vaccination, but not more than three weeks after, with a median time frame of nine days. "We know that for these vaccines, that for the first several days after vaccination, there are flu-like symptoms that can include headache," he said, adding that those are likely common side effects. "If someone presented to an emergency room with very severe headache or blood clots," doctors should ask whether they recently got a vaccine before putting together a plan of care. If the patient also has low platelets, doctors should consider that it may be related to the vaccine, he said. Marks told reporters that researchers haven't yet found a specific cause for the blood clotting in J&J vaccine recipients, but they believed it was similar to other adeno viral vector vaccines. "That is an immune response that occurs very, very rarely after some people receive the vaccine and that immune response leads to activation of the platelets and the extremely rare blood clots," he said.
A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel on Wednesday decided to postpone a decision on Johnson & Johnson's Covid vaccine while it investigates cases of six women developing a rare blood-clotting disorder that left one dead and one in critical condition. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met a day after the FDA asked states to temporarily halt using J&J's vaccine "out of an abundance of caution." The panel will reconvene in a week, when it will decide what it will recommend to the CDC on J&J's vaccine. The postponement means the pause on J&J's vaccine will remain in effect.	A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel on Wednesday decided to postpone a decision on Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine while it investigates cases of six women developing a rare but potentially life-threatening blood-clotting disorder that left one dead and one in critical condition. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met a day after the Food and Drug Administration asked states to temporarily halt using J&J's vaccine "out of an abundance of caution." The panel voted unanimously to reconvene in a week, when it will decide what it will recommend to the CDC on J&J's vaccine. The postponement means the pause on J&J's vaccine will remain in effect. The committee debated whether to and how long they wanted to continue the pause on J&J's vaccine while the CDC investigates the cause of the blood clotting. One committee member recommended a monthlong hold on restarting immunizations, while other members recommended a few weeks. Some members asked whether they could hold off on voting until they had more time to digest the data. One of the options the panel considered was whether to recommend limiting the vaccine's use based on age or other risk factors. Dr. Grace Lee, a member of the committee, said she worried a vote to pause the use of the vaccine indefinitely would send the wrong message to the public. She and others added it could make it appear that something is fundamentally wrong with the vaccine. "That is not the decision I think makes the most sense," she said. Sandra Fryhofer of the American Medical Association was in favor of a pause. She said there is enough supply of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to continue rapid vaccinations across the U.S. "I know there are many patients that have not been able to get vaccinated that need to get vaccinated, but we want to make sure these vaccines are safe," she said. Dr. Nirav Shah, the director for the CDC in Maine, said the committee's vote to postpone a decision on the use of the vaccine is "tantamount to making a decision." "Any extension of the pause will invariably result in the fact that the most vulnerable individuals in the United States who were prime candidates for the J&J vaccine will remain vulnerable. The most at risk will remain at risk." The CDC and FDA advised states to reschedule J&J vaccine appointments after six women developed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or CVST, within about two weeks of receiving the shot, U.S. health officials told reporters on Tuesday. CVST is a rare form of a stroke that happens when a blood clot forms in the brain's venous sinuses. It can eventually leak blood into the brain tissues and cause a hemorrhage. "CVST is rare but clinically serious and can result in substantial morbidity and mortality," Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, a CDC official, told the committee. He said the CVST cases appeared to be three times greater in the J&J vaccine group than among women ages 20 to 50 years old with similar backgrounds. Within hours of the FDA's warning early Tuesday, more than a dozen states as well as some national pharmacies halted inoculations with J&J's vaccine, some replacing scheduled appointments with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. U.S. health officials had said the pause on the use of the vaccine might last only a matter of days, depending on what they learn in their investigation of the cases. White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday the pause on the use of the vaccine would give U.S. health regulators the time they need to thoroughly investigate the cases and "find some common denominators among the women who were involved." A 25-year-old man developed CVST along with a hemorrhage during the clinical trial; he was hospitalized but recovered. All of the six cases that occurred after the clinical trial were found in white women, Shimabukuro said, noting that the median time to symptom onset was eight days. Three were described as obese, one had hyperthyroidism, one had asthma and one had hypertension, he said. Five of the six patients initially developed headaches and one had back pain and bruising before more serious other symptoms set in, he said. One of the women has died. Three of the patients remain hospitalized, while two have been discharged, he said. "These are significant blood clots that are causing these problems," he said. Dr. Aaran Maree, chief medical officer for J&J's vaccine division, Janssen Pharmaceutical Cos., told the committee that none of the women were on birth control, which was theorized as a possible link to the blood clotting. They also all tested negative for Covid-19. One of the two patients who recovered was a 26-year-old woman who was described as "overweight but active," wasn't on any medication and had no history of clotting disorder. She was admitted to the hospital with a severe headache a week after receiving the J&J vaccine and was discharged but returned to the hospital a week later with abdominal pain and a rapid heart rate, he said. Tests revealed she developed thrombocytopenia, or a low level of platelets in the blood, and CVST. One 48-year-old woman with an "unremarkable past medical history" was admitted to the hospital after three days of malaise and abdominal pain. She developed severe thrombocytopenia and CVST that progressed with hemorrhagic stroke despite treatment with the blood thinner heparin. She received the J&J vaccine two weeks prior to symptom onset and remains critically ill, according to the last report.
Moderna said Tuesday its Covid-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective at protecting against Covid and more than 95% effective against severe disease up to six months after the second dose. The new data included cases through April 9 and evaluated over 900 cases, including more than 100 severe cases. The update brings Moderna a step closer to filing its request for full U.S. approval for its vaccine.	Moderna 's Covid-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective at protecting against Covid and more than 95% effective against severe disease up to six months after the second dose, the company said Tuesday, citing updated data from its phase three clinical trial. The update brings Moderna a step closer to filing its request for full U.S. approval for its vaccine. Full approval requires a more rigorous review process to show the shot is safe and effective for its intended use. Once it gets full approval, Moderna can begin marketing the shots directly to consumers and selling them to individuals and private companies in the U.S. The new data included Covid-19 cases through April 9 and evaluated over 900 cases, including more than 100 severe cases, it said. The vaccine is currently authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration for people who are age 18 and older, and the agency can revoke the emergency use authorization, or EUA, at any time. Moderna submitted only two months of follow-up safety data for the EUA. The FDA usually requires six months for full approval. The company said its results are preliminary. Moderna said throughout the year it will share updated data on efficacy against asymptomatic infection as well as the persistence of antibodies. The new data comes after a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed antibodies induced by the Moderna vaccine were still present six months after the second dose. It also comes after Pfizer said earlier this month its vaccine, which uses technology similar to Moderna's, was also shown to be highly effective six months after the second dose. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist who has sat on several drug data and safety monitoring boards, called Moderna's update "amazing news" and said he's glad to hear that both mRNA vaccines are highly effective at six months. "I think it is fair to estimate that they will both have decent efficacy for many months beyond this," he said. Moderna is still evaluating its vaccine in people ages 17 and younger. The company said Tuesday its trial testing the vaccine in adolescents ages 12 to 17 is now fully enrolled, with about 3,000 participants in the U.S. It said its trial testing the vaccine in children 6 months to 11 years old is currently enrolling participants. It expects to enroll 6,750 healthy pediatric participants in the U.S. and Canada. As in Pfizer's study, kids will begin by receiving a low dose of the vaccine before progressively moving to higher doses.
A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel on Wednesday decided to postpone a decision on the use of Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine. Dr. Atul Gawande said that he “thinks there is something distinct going on here” when it comes to blood clotting and J&J’s vaccine. Gawande said that while he believes the pause on the J&J vaccine for younger populations makes sense, he thinks that it could be lifted for older age groups.	Dr. Atul Gawande said he "thinks there is something distinct going on here" when it comes to blood clotting and Johnson & Johnson 's single-dose Covid-19 vaccine. "We have an unusual kind of blood clotting syndrome, very specific to these vaccines, in the younger age group women, and it's not like the other kinds of cases that these rare incidents occur. So I think there probably is, for adenovirus vaccines, some risk of this rare condition that's elevated in a particular age group," said Gawande. Experts on a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel decided to postpone a decision on the use of J&J's single-dose Covid vaccine on Wednesday. They determined that they needed more time to assess the data and risks. The meeting comes one day after federal health agencies advised that the U.S. should temporarily pause the use of J&J's single-dose vaccine out of "an abundance of caution" after six women out of the roughly 6.9 million people who received the shot reported getting severe blood clots.  By postponing the vote, the pause will remain in effect for now. Gawande, a surgeon and professor at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said he believes the pause on the J&J vaccine for younger populations makes sense, while he also thinks that it could be lifted for older age groups. "I think there is enough information to know that for people over 50 this is safe, and I think they could have potentially lifted the pause for the older age group," said Gawande on CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith ." "I think that that is where this may land, like you saw for AstraZeneca in Europe." More than 7.2 million J&J doses have been administered nationwide , and the vaccine is responsible for 9.5% of the roughly 75 million Americans who are fully vaccinated, according to CDC data. Gawande noted that the supply of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines can be used to stem the surge of cases in states across the U.S. He told host Shepard Smith that he's been advocating to push the second dose of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines "out two, four, six weeks" in order to double the number of people currently being vaccinated.
Merck announced Thursday it will end the development of a Covid-19 drug it acquired from biopharmaceutical company OncoImmune. Merck disclosed in February that U.S. regulators had asked for more data on the drug to support a potential emergency use authorization. Due to "regulatory uncertainties" and the time and resources needed to provide the additional data, Merck said  it decided to discontinue the development of the drug.	Merck announced Thursday it will end the development of its experimental drug for patients hospitalized with severe Covid-19 after the Food and Drug Administration asked the company to provide additional data to support an emergency use authorization. New Jersey-based Merck acquired the drug, MK-7110, through its $425 million acquisition of privately held biopharmaceutical company OncoImmune late last year. An interim analysis of clinical trial data suggested the drug improved the chances of recovery for the sickest patients with Covid-19 and reduced the risk of death or respiratory failure. However, Merck disclosed in February that U.S. regulators had asked for more data on the drug beyond the phase three trial already conducted. At the time, the company said it no longer expected to supply the U.S. with the drug in the first half of 2021. Now, due to "regulatory uncertainties" and the time and resources needed to provide the additional data, Merck said it decided to discontinue the development of the drug and instead focus its efforts on advancing its other Covid-19 drug as well as accelerating production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. "Based on the additional research that would be required – new clinical trials as well as research related to manufacturing at scale – MK-7110 would not be expected to become available until the first half of 2022," the company said in a press release. The announcement marks another disappointment for Merck in efforts to combat the pandemic. In January, it announced it would end the development of its two Covid-19 vaccines . In early trials, both vaccines generated immune responses that were inferior to those seen in people who had recovered from Covid-19 as well as those reported for other vaccines, according to the company. While Merck is discontinuing MK-7110, the company said it will move forward with its oral antiviral drug, molnupiravir, in a phase three clinical trial testing non-hospitalized patients with Covid-19. "We continue to make progress in the clinical development of our antiviral candidate molnupiravir," Roy Baynes, Merck's chief medical officer, said in a release. "Data from the dose-finding portion of these studies are consistent with the mechanism of action and provide meaningful evidence for the antiviral potential of the 800 mg dose." –Reuters contributed to this report.
In late March, an armed Islamist group attacked the gas-rich town of Palma in the country's northern Cabo Delgado province, inflicting mass civilian casualties and displacing tens of thousands. The attack came within hours of French energy giant Total announcing that it was resuming operations at its Mozambique Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project, a $20 billion facility under construction in the nearby Afungi Peninsula. Alongside Total's Mozambique LNG Project, U.S. energy major ExxonMobil is leading the Rovuma LNG project and Italy's Eni the Coral South FLNG Terminal. "There will be a security vacuum in Cabo Delgado in the coming month, if not longer, which leaves both Palma and other locations in the province exposed to further militant attacks," Pangea-Risk CEO Robert Besseling said.	Mozambique had pinned its economic hopes on the colossal natural gas deposits discovered a decade ago — but an escalating Islamist insurgency threatens to pull the rug from beneath a surge in private investment. In late March, an armed Islamist group loosely affiliated with ISIS and known locally as Al-Shabab — not to be confused with the Somali militant group of the same name — attacked the gas-rich town of Palma in the country's northern Cabo Delgado province, inflicting mass civilian casualties and displacing tens of thousands. The attack came within hours of French energy giant Total announcing that it was resuming operations at its Mozambique Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project, a $20 billion facility under construction in the nearby Afungi Peninsula. In total, up to $120 billion is at stake on LNG projects across the country, according to Standard Bank. The International Monetary Fund expects GDP in Mozambique to grow 2.1% in 2021, with inflation projected at 5.3%. But Standard Bank highlighted in a recent note that the escalation towards guerilla warfare could erode the benefits of the LNG projects. "While the long-term growth outlook remains largely positive, supported by LNG investments, armed conflicts constrain the prospects for more inclusive growth," it said. Along with the humanitarian crisis triggered by the insurgency — with the United Nations World Food Program warning on Tuesday that almost a million people now face severe hunger in the north of the country — the attacks also pose an existential threat to government finances. "The longer the conflict pushes back the completion of the planned LNG projects, the longer it will take for the debt-ridden Mozambican government to earn revenue from gas exports," said Gerrit van Rooyen, economist at NKC African Economics. Total has now withdrawn all staff from its Afungi site, but van Rooyen suggested this could be a tactic to pressure the government into beefing up security around the Afungi complex and accepting foreign help, rather than a permanent exit. Total declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. President Filipe Nyusi's administration has relied primarily on private security contractors to assist in defense efforts, while restricting access to aid workers and journalists. Alongside Total's LNG project, both U.S. energy major ExxonMobil and Italy's Eni are leading separate energy projects in the country, all of which are critical to Mozambique's fiscal future. The delayed start date of LNG exports is expected to tangibly reduce government revenue. Mozambique's Ministry of Economy and Finance estimated in 2018 that a 20% cost overrun and 18 month delay on two key areas of the LNG projects could slash government revenue by around 6% — almost $2.5 billion — over a 25-year project lifeline. "The longer the LNG projects take to reap benefits, the longer the government will have to rely on other resources and international aid to finance the country's economic development and service its foreign public debt," van Rooyen said. NKC estimates that external public debt stood at $11.8 billion, or almost 87% of GDP, at the end of 2020, with the government spending more than 13% of total revenue on interest payments over the year. The LNG projects are expected to lift growth back to above 5% per annum, van Rooyen said, which — if all goes to plan — should help to steer the country's debt pile to a more sustainable level. Both Mozambican security forces and private military contractors, along with Total's security team, were blindsided by the raid by Al-Shabab last month . The ensuing battle lasted around 12 days and counterinsurgency operations are ongoing. The 16-nation Southern African Development Community held an emergency meeting last week in which it condemned the violence and vowed a "proportionate regional response." Risk consultancy Pangea-Risk said in a research report last week that the attack was not triggered by Total's announcement to restart operations . Instead, it said the move came after months of preparatory planning by militants who have become increasingly active in the region since 2017. Pangea-Risk  warned first in October 2020 and again on March 12, two weeks before the attack, that insurgents were planning attacks across natural gas hub towns. "There will be a security vacuum in Cabo Delgado in the coming month, if not longer, which leaves both Palma and other locations in the province exposed to further militant attacks," Pangea-Risk CEO Robert Besseling said. Besseling said local sources now expect a raid on the Quitunda resettlement village, near the Afungi Peninsula LNG site, in the coming weeks. "Such a raid would put pressure on the Afungi garrison to leave the security zone around the LNG site and deploy to protect vulnerable displaced communities in Quitunda, perhaps in breach of the Mozambican government's security contract with Total ," he added. Besseling suggested the provincial capital of Pemba and the Tanzanian port town and natural gas hub at Mtwara, in the Rovuma border region between the two countries, will be "highly aspirational targets" for the insurgents. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Cabo Delgado is expected to deteriorate in the coming weeks as refugees continue to flee Palma toward camps in nearby districts, with the total number of displaced people estimated at more than 700,000 and rising.
CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said earlier this month that hospitals are seeing more younger adults admitted with Covid-19 as more contagious variants spread. Older teens and young adults were among the last prioritized to get the coronavirus vaccines and many of them have yet to receive the shots. Young adults are also thought to be involved in more high-risk behaviors such as playing close-contact sports and going out to bars. Those factors coupled with the highly contagious B.1.1.7 variant are likely driving a surge in young people going to the hospital, health experts say.	Dr. Paul Offit, a physician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said he is now seeing more patients with a rare inflammatory condition, a complication of Covid-19 , than he has ever witnessed since the pandemic began. In Texas, Dr. James McDeavitt, dean of clinical affairs at Baylor College of Medicine, said he and his colleagues are noticing a rise in admissions of young people with Covid-19, though he did not have hard data yet to back up the anecdotal evidence. Both doctors attributed the rise in hospital visits of teens and young adults, at least in part, to B.1.1.7, the coronavirus variant first identified in the U.K. that public health officials say is now the most common strain circulating in the U.S. The variant is highly contagious, thought to be about 60% more transmissible than the original strain of the virus. "I think they're getting infected more frequently because of the contagiousness of the virus," said Offit, a health expert in the fields of virology and immunology, who has also served on advisory panels for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. "So for that reason, I think you will see and are seeing more disease" in children and young adults. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said earlier this month hospitals are seeing more and more younger adults being admitted with Covid-19 as new, more contagious variants of the virus spread faster than ever before.  Nationwide, the number of 18- to 64-year-olds visiting emergency departments with Covid is increasing while the number of visits among patients 65 and older is declining, according to a slide presented by Walensky during a news briefing last week. "Cases and emergency room visits are up," Walensky said. "We are seeing these increases in younger adults, most of whom have not yet been vaccinated." In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said last week the state is seeing the Covid positivity rate rise among people ages 18 to 24. In Michigan, where Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations are rapidly increasing, case rates are at an all-time high for those age 19 and younger, according to state data published April 6. Hospital admissions are increasing for all age groups, with the greatest increase seen in people between the ages of 40 and 49, according to the state's data. Health experts say the issue is multifaceted: Older teens and young adults were among the last prioritized to get the Covid-19 vaccines and many of them have yet to get the shots. In addition, young adults are thought to be involved in more high-risk behaviors such as playing close-contact sports, going out to bars, attending unmasked get-togethers or traveling. Those factors coupled with the highly contagious B.1.1.7 variant are likely driving a surge in young people going to the hospital, health experts say. We are seeing "less disease in the elderly, due to vaccination, so proportionally we will see more disease in young adults now," said Dr. Stephen Schrantz, an infectious disease expert at UChicago Medicine, adding it is still unclear how much of this increase is due to the B.1.1.7 strain alone. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto, said there's emerging evidence that indicates B.1.1.7 causes more symptoms and more severe disease. He said health officials in the U.S. and in other countries where the strain is prevalent might see a shift toward unvaccinated young people ending up in hospitals or even in the ICU. "There are things that are not working in our favor right now, which is B.1.1.7 and other variants of concern," he said. Even though more young people may get sick, Schrantz of UChicago said he doesn't expect many of them to get severely ill, especially school-aged children. He said young adults with comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes, are likely the most at risk. "The severity of the disease is based predominately on two factors — the virus and the host," Schrantz said. "While the virus is changing, I do not believe the mutations in the spike protein will have an increased virulence in kids because their bodies, and more specifically their immune systems, just react less severely to the virus. In other words, I think the host is the more important variable compared to changes in the virus," he said. Offit said he expects things to improve as the U.S. vaccinates more adults, regardless of age, adding it will become more difficult for the virus to spread from one person to the next as more people have antibodies. As of Thursday, more than 125 million Americans have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to data compiled by the CDC. That's roughly 37% of the total U.S. population. Young people are "living in the herd," Offit said. "The more the herd is vaccinated, the less the virus can spread."
The Biden administration is preparing for the potential need for Covid-19 vaccine booster shots, though nothing is certain, a top U.S. official said Friday. "Requiring additional shots in the future is obviously a foreseeable potential event," Andy Slavitt, senior advisor to President Joe Biden's Covid response team, told reporters. In comments that aired Thursday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said people will "likely" need a third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine within 12 months of getting fully vaccinated.	The Biden administration is preparing for the potential need for Covid-19 vaccine booster shots, though nothing is certain, a top U.S. official said Friday. "Requiring additional shots in the future is obviously a foreseeable potential event," Andy Slavitt, senior advisor to President Joe Biden's Covid response team, told reporters during a press briefing Friday. "I want to emphasize that while there is certainly speculation about this, that is far from saying that is what's going to happen." Should Americans require booster shots, the U.S. government would likely need to make arrangements with the drugmakers to supply additional doses and make plans for vaccine distribution. Slavitt said Friday the administration has thought about the need to secure additional doses. "I can assure you that when we do our planning, when the president orders purchases of additional vaccines as he has done and when we focus on all the production expansion opportunities that we talk about in here we very much have scenarios like that in mind," he said. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, in comments that were aired for the first time Thursday, said people will likely need a third dose, or booster shot, of a Covid-19 vaccine within 12 months of getting fully vaccinated . Bourla also said it's possible people will need to get vaccinated against the coronavirus annually, like for the seasonal flu. "A likely scenario is that there will be likely a need for a third dose, somewhere between six and 12 months, and then from there, there will be an annual revaccination, but all of that needs to be confirmed. And again, the variants will play a key role," he told CNBC's Bertha Coombs during an event with CVS Health. "It is extremely important to suppress the pool of people that can be susceptible to the virus," he added. Pfizer and Moderna have both said their two-dose Covid-19 vaccines, which use similar technology, remain highly effective six months after the second dose. However, researchers still don't know how long protection against the virus lasts after six months of being fully vaccinated, though health experts do expect protection to wane after some time. On Thursday, the Biden administration's Covid response chief science officer, David Kessler, said Americans should expect to receive booster shots to protect against coronavirus variants. He told U.S. lawmakers that currently authorized vaccines are highly protective but noted new variants could "challenge" the effectiveness of the shots. "We don't know everything at this moment," he told the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. "We are studying the durability of the antibody response," he said. "It seems strong, but there is some waning of that, and no doubt the variants challenge ... they make these vaccines work harder. So I think for planning purposes, planning purposes only, I think we should expect that we may have to boost." Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel told CNBC on Wednesday that the company hopes to have a booster shot for its two-dose vaccine available in the fall.
Raul Castro said Friday he is resigning as head of Cuba's Communist Party, ending an era of formal leadership by he and his brother Fidel Castro that began with the 1959 revolution. His retirement means that for the first time in more than six decades Cubans won't have a Castro formally guiding their affairs. Castro didn't say who he would endorse as his successor as first secretary of the Communist Party. But he previously indicated that he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel Diaz-Canel.	Raul Castro said Friday he is resigning as head of Cuba's Communist Party, ending an era of formal leadership by he and his brother Fidel Castro that began with the 1959 revolution. The 89-year-old Castro made the announcement Friday in a speech at the opening of the Eighth congress of the ruling party, the only one allowed on the island. He said he was retiring with the sense of having "fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland." Castro didn't say who he would endorse as his successor as first secretary of the Communist Party. But he previously indicated that he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel Diaz-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cuba's one-party system. His retirement means that for the first time in more than six decades Cubans won't have a Castro formally guiding their affairs, and it comes at a difficult time, with many on the island anxious about what lies ahead. The coronavirus pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long food lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the "special period" that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Discontent has been fueled by the spread of the internet and growing inequality. Much of the debate inside Cuba is focused on the pace of reform, with many complaining that the so-called "historic generation" represented by Castro has been too slow to open the economy. In January, Diaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the island's dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise — a category long banned or tightly restricted — permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes. This year's congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attract foreign investment and provide more legal protection to private business activities. The Communist Party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cuba's constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society. Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism. He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country's unquestioned leader until falling ill inh 2006 and in 2008 handing over the presidency to his younger brother Raul, who had fought alongside him during the revolution. Raul succeeded him as head of the party in 2011. Fidel Castro died in 2016.
The FDA asked Emergent BioSolutions to temporarily stop producing materials for Covid-19 vaccines while U.S. regulators investigate its plant in Baltimore responsible for ruining millions of J&J, Emergent said in a regulatory filing. It said the FDA initiated an inspection of the facility on April 12 and asked the company to halt manufacturing four days later, pending completion of the review and remediation.	The Food and Drug Administration has asked Emergent BioSolutions to temporarily stop producing materials for Covid-19 vaccines while U.S. regulators investigate its plant in Baltimore responsible for ruining millions of Johnson & Johnson shots, Emergent said in a regulatory filing Monday. It said the FDA initiated an inspection of the facility on April 12 and asked the company to halt manufacturing four days later, pending completion of the review and remediation. In a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company also said it quarantined all existing material manufactured at the facility. Shares of Emergent were down more than 9% on the news. In a statement to CNBC, J&J said it will work with Emergent and FDA "to address any findings at the conclusion of the FDA inspection." "Our goal remains ensuring all drug substance for our COVID-19 vaccine meets our high-quality standards and securing Emergency Use Authorization for drug substance manufactured at Emergent Bayview," the company said. "At this time, it is premature to speculate on any potential impact this could have on the timing of our vaccine deliveries." Earlier this month, the Biden administration put J&J in charge of the Baltimore plant after U.S. officials learned that Emergent, a contract manufacturer that had been making vaccines for J&J and AstraZeneca , mixed up ingredients for the two shots. Officials also stopped production of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The government's move to have the facility make only the J&J single-dose vaccine is meant to avoid future mix-ups, The New York Times reported, citing two senior federal health officials. The pause of production of new materials is the latest setback for J&J. Last week, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised states to temporarily stop using J&J's vaccine "out of an abundance of caution" after six women developed a rare but potentially life-threatening blood clotting disorder that left one dead and one in critical condition. The women developed the condition known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis within about two weeks of receiving the shot, an official said. CVST is a rare form of stroke that happens when a blood clot forms in the brain's venous sinuses. It can eventually leak blood into the brain tissues and cause a hemorrhage. J &J privately asked Covid-19 vaccine rivals Pfizer and Moderna to join a study looking into the risk of blood clots but the companies declined, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday , citing people familiar with the matter. –Reuters contributed to this report.
Fauci said "we can't be pejorative to them. We've got to try and convince them.' He said the "easiest" way to get out of the pandemic is to get a vaccine.	White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Monday it is "disturbing" that some Americans won't take a Covid-19 vaccine due to political reasons. Fauci said those refusing to get vaccinated against the virus are the same ones who say the U.S. government is "encroaching on our liberties" by asking Americans to wear masks and implement other pandemic safety measures. He said the "easiest" way to get out of the pandemic is to get a vaccine. "It's almost paradoxical that they don't want to get vaccinated," Fauci said during an interview with "CBS This Morning." "So that's the thing that we've got to work on. We can't be pejorative to them. We've got to try and convince them why it's so important to get to where they want to be and where I want to be and where all public health officials want to be, would be to get vaccinated." Fauci's comments come as President Joe Biden's deadline arrived for states to expand their vaccine eligibility requirements. Biden asked states to open appointments to all U.S. adults by Monday . Even with vaccine eligibility opening up, polls suggest a significant portion of Americans will refuse to take the shots, potentially stalling that nation's recovery from the pandemic that has killed at least 567,233 Americans in a little over a year. About 28% of Republicans said they will "definitely not" get a Covid-19, and 18% said they will "wait and see" before getting a shot, according to a poll from the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation released in late February. Anthony D. Dell'Aera, Worcester State University assistant professor of political science, told CNBC in a recent interview that these Republicans, many of them supporters of former President Donald Trump, are often distrustful of government and therefore will likely refuse the vaccines. He said researchers saw similar vaccine resistance among Republicans during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. "Republicans, and the Trump supporters specifically, are the most likely to have less confidence in government and the vaccination push," he said, adding that vaccine resistance goes "beyond" Trump himself. Trump simply "tapped into this distrust of government and I think Trump helped get this prospect more out in the open," he added. Fauci said the U.S. has deployed thousands of clergy, athletes and other respected members of local communities to persuade people to get vaccinated. "There really is going to be a full-court press on getting people [vaccinated,] no matter who they are," he said.
U.S. health officials have confirmed fewer than 6,000 cases of Covid-19 in fully vaccinated Americans, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said. That represents just 0.007% of the 84 million Americans with full protection against the virus. The CDC chief acknowledged that the number could be an underestimate.	U.S. health officials have confirmed fewer than 6,000 cases of Covid-19 in fully vaccinated Americans, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Monday. That represents just 0.007% of the 84 million Americans with full protection against the virus. Despite the breakthrough infections, she said the vaccines are working as intended. "With any vaccine, we expect such rare cases, but so far out of more than 84 million people who were fully vaccinated, we have only received reports of less than 6,000 breakthrough cases," Walensky told reporters at a press briefing. Breakthrough cases occur when someone contracts the virus more than 14 days after their second shot, she said. The CDC chief acknowledged that the number could be an underestimate. "Although this number is from 43 states and territories and likely an underestimate, it still makes a really important point, these vaccines are working. Of the nearly 6,000 cases, approximately 30% had no symptoms at all," Walensky said. "This is really encouraging encouraging news. It demonstrates what we've already discussed about these vaccines. They also help prevent you from getting seriously ill," she said. Out of the 6,000 or so breakthrough infections, 396 people were hospitalized and 74 people died, according to CDC data released last week. Half of all American adults have received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Of those age 65 and older, 81% have received one dose or more and about two-thirds are fully vaccinated. U.S. health officials are launching a massive campaign to persuade more Americans to take the vaccine. An increasing number of people has become skeptical after the CDC and Food and Drug Administration asked states to temporarily halt distribution of Johnson & Johnson vaccines last week after cases of a rare, but potentially deadly, blood-clotting disorder were reported to the CDC. Some of former President Donald Trump 's supporters also are strongly opposed to taking the vaccine, which worries U.S. health officials hoping enough people will get immunized so the country can obtain herd immunity to the virus. White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci has previously said 75% to 85% of the U.S. population need to be inoculated to create an "umbrella" of immunity that prevents the virus from spreading. "It's very disturbing that on the basis of political persuasion people are not wanting to get vaccinated," Fauci said Monday on "CBS This Morning." "I find that really extraordinary because those are the ones who are saying you're encroaching on our liberties by asking us to wear masks and do kinds of restrictions that are public health issues. The easiest way to get out of that is to get vaccinated." The U.S. is reporting 723 Covid deaths per day, according to a seven-day average based on data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. All 50 U.S. states, at Biden's urging, opened vaccine appointments to people age 16 and older by Monday. —CNBC's Nate Rattner contributed to this report. Correction: This story was updated to correct fatality data. Of the roughly 6,000 breakthrough infections, at least 74 patients died as of April 13. 
Half of all American adults have received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine, and of those age 65 and older, 81% have received one dose or more, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “I worry... that we're rapidly transitioning our country from a supply issue, a scarcity issue with vaccines, to a demand issue,” said Dr. Carlos Del Rio. “I will tell you the most reluctant communities are primarily white evangelicals and we really need to get out to those communities to vaccinate them.” “When we can get community transmission down to below ten cases per 100,000 population, I think wearing masks outdoors is not going to be necessary,” said Del Rio.	Dr. Carlos Del Rio said that U.S. Covid cases could drop dramatically going into May, as long as the U.S. continues to vaccinate aggressively and convinces reluctant communities to get vaccinated. "I worry... that we're rapidly transitioning our country from a supply issue, a scarcity issue with vaccines, to a demand issue," said Del Rio. "I will tell you the most reluctant communities are primarily white evangelicals and we really need to get out to those communities to vaccinate them." There are about 41 million white evangelical adults in the U.S., and about 45% said in late February that they would not get vaccinated against Covid-19, making them among the least likely demographic group to do so, according to the Pew Research Center.  Half of all American adults have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Of those age 65 and older, 81% have received one dose or more, and about two-thirds are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Del Rio, a professor of medicine specializing in infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine, told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith" that the U.S. may be able to follow Israel's lead and lift outdoor masking requirements if community transmission drops. "When we can get community transmission down to below ten cases per 100,000 population, I think wearing masks outdoors is not going to be necessary," said Del Rio. Host Shepard Smith also asked Del Rio about Texas and those who point to the state as an example of successfully lifting mask mandates. The average daily Covid cases are down 41% in Texas since Gov. Greg Abbott lifted the mask mandate 40 days ago, according to Johns Hopkins University. Del Rio noted that there's still a lot of unknowns about Covid and that states should still proceed with caution when it comes to lifting Covid restrictions. "I think sometimes we wonder whether a place like Texas is good or lucky, and I think it's more lucky than good, quite frankly," said Del Rio. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky has warned that Americans should still have their guard up when it comes to Covid.
The United States on Wednesday imposed fresh Myanmar-related sanctions, targeting two state-owned enterprises in the latest in a series of punitive actions following the country's military coup as Washington said it would take further action. The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it blacklisted Myanmar Timber Enterprise (MTE) and Myanmar Pearl Enterprise.	The United States on Wednesday imposed fresh Myanmar-related sanctions, targeting two state-owned enterprises in the latest in a series of punitive actions following the country's military coup as Washington said it would take further action. The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it blacklisted Myanmar Timber Enterprise (MTE) and Myanmar Pearl Enterprise, adding that the pearl and timber industries are economic resources for the Myanmar military. The Southeast Asian country has been in crisis since the February coup when the military seized power from Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government, with almost daily protests and a crackdown by the junta in which hundreds of people have been killed. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington would continue to target funding channels to the junta. "We will continue to support the people of Burma in their efforts to reject this coup, and we call on the military regime to cease violence, release all those unjustly detained, and restore Burma's path to democracy," Blinken said in a separate statement. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), an activist group, says 738 people have been killed by Myanmar's security forces since the coup and 3,300 people are in detention. Another 20 people have been sentenced to death and are in hiding. Wednesday's action freezes any U.S. assets of the businesses and generally bars Americans from dealing with the companies that the Treasury said are responsible for timber and pearl exports from Myanmar. The Environmental Investigation Agency, an international nonprofit that documents timber industry abuses in Myanmar and elsewhere, said this month that the military junta now profits from the export of teak through MTE. That teak is sometimes exported to the United States and Europe and used for luxury furniture and for the decks of high-end yachts, the group says. "Sanctions placed on MTE in Myanmar is a significant blow to the military regime, which directly profits from the country's valuable and diminishing forests," said Faith Doherty, the group's forests campaign leader. She added that the move would also undermine corrupt officials. Doherty said the sanctions mean no timber or timber products from Myanmar can be exported to the United States, and called on the U.S. Justice Department to "be vigilant in its monitoring of Myanmar timber into its markets."
The FDA said Wednesday a Baltimore plant that ruined millions of Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine doses was unsanitary and unsuitable to manufacture the shots. The FDA asked Emergent BioSolutions, which runs the plant, to temporarily stop producing materials for Covid-19 vaccines earlier this month. The inspection, which was conducted earlier this month over a period of 8 days, revealed a raft of alarming quality issues found throughout the facility.	The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday a Baltimore plant that ruined millions of Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine doses was unsanitary and unsuitable to manufacture the shots. The FDA asked Emergent BioSolutions, which runs the plant, to temporarily stop producing materials for Covid-19 vaccines earlier this month as the U.S. agency initiated an inspection. "The firm has failed to adequately train personnel involved in manufacturing operations, quality control sampling, weigh and dispense, and engineering operations to prevent cross-contamination of bulk drug substances," the FDA investigators wrote in the report. The inspection, which was conducted earlier this month over a period of 8 days, revealed a raft of alarming quality issues found throughout the facility. In a 13-page report , inspectors wrote that the facility used to manufacture the vaccine was "not maintained in a clean and sanitary condition" and was "not of suitable size, design, and location to facilitate cleaning, maintenance, and proper operations." FDA inspectors said paint was observed to be peeling in multiple areas and walls were damaged that could impact the plant's "ability to adequately clean and disinfect." They also noted that employees did not follow standard operating procedures in handling waste or vaccine manufacturing materials to ensure they weren't contaminated. The facility has not been authorized by the FDA to manufacture or distribute Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine, and none of the doses manufactured at this plant has been distributed for use in the United States. Emergent has agreed to pause production of materials until the issues the FDA identified are resolved, the agency said. In a statement, J&J said it has increased "its oversight of drug substance manufacturing at the Emergent BioSolutions Bayview facility, including additional controls and personnel, to ensure the quality standards of our company and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) are met." "Johnson & Johnson will exercise its oversight authority to ensure that all of FDA's observations are addressed promptly and comprehensively," it said. Emergent said it was committed to working with the FDA and J&J to fix the problems. "While we are never satisfied to see shortcomings in our manufacturing facilities or process, they are correctable and we will take swift action to remedy them," it said in a statement. Robert Califf, the former commissioner of the FDA under the Obama administration, said that while the issues at the Baltimore plant appear "distressing," manufacturing problems do happen and are a reason why FDA oversight is so important. "Supply chain and manufacturing is really a complicated set of issues, but that's why you need an FDA and you need inspections, and it's really a joint responsibility of the FDA and the companies themselves," he told CNBC in a phone interview. Earlier this month, the Biden administration put J&J in charge of the Baltimore plant after U.S. officials learned that Emergent, a contract manufacturer that had been making vaccines for J&J and AstraZeneca , mixed up ingredients for the two shots. Officials also stopped production of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Pausing production of new materials is the latest setback for J&J. Last week, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised states to temporarily stop using J&J's vaccine "out of an abundance of caution" after six women developed a rare but potentially life-threatening blood-clotting disorder that left one dead and one in critical condition. A key CDC panel is scheduled to meet Friday to make a recommendation on the use of the vaccine. The FDA said Wednesday its actions on the Baltimore plant are unrelated to the ongoing evaluation of the blood-clotting cases.
The chief medical officer of BioNTech told CNBC that people will likely need a third shot of its two-dose Covid-19 vaccine as immunity against the virus wanes. Dr. Ozlem Tureci, co-founder and CMO of BioNTech, which developed a Covid vaccine with Pfizer, said she also expects people will need to get vaccinated against the coronavirus annually, like for the seasonal flu.	The chief medical officer of BioNTech told CNBC on Wednesday that people will likely need a third shot of its two-dose Covid-19 vaccine as immunity against the virus wanes, agreeing with previous comments made by Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla. Dr. Ozlem Tureci, co-founder and CMO of BioNTech, which developed a Covid vaccine with Pfizer, said she also expects people will need to get vaccinated against the coronavirus annually, like for the seasonal flu. That's because, she said, scientists expect vaccine-induced immunity against the virus will decrease over time. "We see indications for this also in the induced, but also the natural immune response against SARS-COV-2," she said during an interview with CNBC's Kelly Evans on " The Exchange ." "We see this waning of immune responses also in people who were just infected and therefore [it's] also expected with the vaccines." Tureci's comments come after Bourla said in an interview that aired April 15 that people will likely need a booster shot, or third dose, of the Covid-19 vaccine within 12 months of getting fully vaccinated. He also said it's possible people will need to get additional shots each year. Pfizer said earlier this month that its Covid-19 vaccine was more than 91% effective at protecting against the virus and more than 95% effective against severe disease up to six months after the second dose. Moderna 's vaccine, which uses technology similar to Pfizer's, was also shown to remain highly effective at six months. Researchers say they still don't know how long protection against the virus lasts after six months of being fully vaccinated, though public health officials and health experts expect protection to wane after some time. Should Americans require booster shots, the U.S. government would likely need to make arrangements with the drugmakers to supply additional doses and make plans for vaccine distribution. On Friday, Andy Slavitt, senior advisor to President Joe Biden 's Covid response team, said the White House is preparing for the potential need for Covid-19 vaccine booster shots. He said the Biden administration has thought about the need to secure additional doses. "I can assure you that when we do our planning, when the president orders purchases of additional vaccines as he has done and when we focus on all the production expansion opportunities that we talk about in here we very much have scenarios like that in mind," he said at a White House press briefing. Last week, the Biden administration's Covid response chief science officer, David Kessler, said Americans should expect to receive booster shots to protect against coronavirus variants. He told U.S. lawmakers that currently authorized vaccines are highly protective but noted new variants could "challenge" the effectiveness of the shots. "We don't know everything at this moment," he told the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. "We are studying the durability of the antibody response," he said. "It seems strong, but there is some waning of that, and no doubt the variants challenge ... they make these vaccines work harder. So I think for planning purposes, planning purposes only, I think we should expect that we may have to boost." Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel told CNBC last week that the company hopes to have a booster shot for its two-dose vaccine available in the fall.
Russia ordered its top army command to begin returning troops to their permanent bases inside the country from Friday, saying it had successfully completed a "snap inspection" of forces in its south and west, near the border with Ukraine, the RIA news agency reported. The announcement prompted the rouble to rise sharply, following weeks of tensions with the West over a major Russian military buildup near Ukraine.	Russia ordered its top army command to begin returning troops to their permanent bases inside the country from Friday, saying it had successfully completed a "snap inspection" of forces in its south and west, near the border with Ukraine, the RIA news agency reported. The announcement prompted the rouble to rise sharply, following weeks of tensions with the West over a major Russian military buildup near Ukraine. It was unclear if the rebasing order covered all of the forces involved in that buildup. The EU's top diplomat said on Monday that Russia has massed some 100,000 troops near the border. "I believe the objectives of the snap inspection have been fully achieved. The troops have demonstrated their ability to provide a credible defence for the country," Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was quoted as saying. "In this regard, I have decided to complete the inspections in the southern and western military districts," he said. He said they would return to their bases by May 1. Shoigu, after overseeing exercises in annexed Crimea near Ukraine's southern border on Thursday, said however that the military had to be ready to respond quickly in case of an "unfavourable" development in the situation near NATO's Defender Europe exercises, the Interfax news agency reported. Defender-Europe is an annual, U.S. Army-led, multinational joint exercise designed to build readiness and interoperability between U.S. and other NATO militaries, as well as other partners. From March to June, more than 28,000 forces from 26 nations will conduct drills across more than 30 training areas in a dozen countries.

The campaign, called "We Can Do This: Live," will target young people through social media and will include virtual events where celebrities and athletes answer Americans' lingering questions about the vaccines, according to NBC News. Famous people slated to participate in the campaign include actress Eva Longoria, Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire investor Mark Cuban, Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest, the co-hosts of "Live with Kelly and Ryan" as well as people from NASCAR, the NBA and WNBA, according to NBC News. The goal, according to a detailed release of the campaign obtained by NBC News, is to reach Americans, particularly young people, "directly in the places where they already consume content online, including social media, podcasts, YouTube, and more." The administration's effort, led by the Department of Health and Human Services , comes as polls suggest a significant portion of Americans will likely refuse to take the shots, potentially stalling the nation's recovery from the pandemic that has killed at least 569,405 Americans in a little over a year. Some young people appear resistant to getting vaccinated. A  recent poll from STAT News-Harris found that 21% of Generation Z, or young adults aged 18 to 24, said they would not get vaccinated against Covid and another 34% said they would "wait a while and see" before getting vaccinated. Additionally, some doctors said a number of their patients became skeptical of the vaccines after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration asked states last week to temporarily halt distribution of Johnson & Johnson 's vaccine after six cases of a rare, but potentially deadly, blood-clotting disorder were reported. Many of former President Donald Trump 's supporters also are strongly opposed to taking the vaccine, experts on public health and politics say, which worries U.S. health officials hoping enough people will get immunized so the country can obtain herd immunity to the virus. White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci has previously said 75% to 85% of the U.S. population need to be inoculated to create an "umbrella" of immunity that prevents the virus from spreading. In some regions of the U.S., the supply of the vaccines is already outpacing demand as local health officials struggle to persuade people to get vaccinated. As of Wednesday, more than 134 million Americans, or 40% of the total U.S. population, have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to data compiled by the CDC. Roughly 87.5 million Americans, or 26.4% of the total U.S. population, are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. The United States averaged 3 million reported shots per day over the past week, according to CDC, down slightly from a peak of 3.4 million reported shots per day on April 13. Fauci said Monday that there would be a "full-court press" to get people vaccinated. "It's very disturbing that on the basis of political persuasion people are not wanting to get vaccinated," Fauci said Monday on "CBS This Morning."

Scientists at Texas A&M University Global Health Research Complex say they've detected a new Covid-19 variant that shows signs of antibody resistance. The variant is named BV-1 for its Brazos Valley origin. Scientists say it is related to the U.K. strain and shows signs of resistance to antibody neutralization.	Scientists at Texas A&M University's Global Health Research Complex say they've detected a new Covid-19 variant that shows signs of a more contagious strain that causes more severe illness and appears to be resistant to antibodies. The new variant, BV-1, named after its Brazos Valley origin, was found during Texas A&M's routine coronavirus screening via saliva sample in a young student who had mild cold-like symptoms. The student tested positive for Covid on March 5 and tested positive again on March 25, showing that the new strain may cause a longer infection in younger people. The student's symptoms resolved by April 2 and a third test on April 9 came back negative. Texas A&M scientists say that cell culture-based experiments from other labs have shown that several neutralizing antibodies had no effect in controlling other variants with the same genetic markers as BV-1. "We do not at present know the full significance of this variant, but it has a combination of mutations similar to other internationally notifiable variants of concern," said Texas A&M Chief Virologist Ben Neuman. "This variant combines genetic markers separately associated with rapid spread, severe disease and high resistance to neutralizing antibodies." The scientists also say they have submitted a paper on BV-1 to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to alert officials before it spreads further. The lab has identified many Covid mutations through its genetic sequencing program, but Neuman said the genetic makeup of this strain is particularly concerning. "We have not detected any more instances of this variant," Neuman added. "We have not grown or tested this virus in any way. This announcement is based purely on the genetic sequence analysis done in the lab." Many U.S. labs sequence only severe Covid cases, but the Texas A&M lab is testing and sequencing asymptomatic students to catch dangerous strains early before they can cause serious illness. "Sequencing helps to provide an early warning system for new variants," Neuman said. The scientists at the lab say they do not yet understand the full significance of BV-1, but believe the variant "highlights an important need for rigorous surveillance and genomic testing," especially among young adults who are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms. Scientists at the lab say the new variant is related to the B.1.1.7 strain out of the U.K., which current vaccines have been shown to be effective against. The related U.K. strain makes up a majority of variant infection in the U.S.
Some people have reported being diagnosed with Covid-19 after receiving their first shot of the vaccine and before receiving their second shot. People who get infected with the virus between Covid vaccine shots can get their second dose after they've recovered from the illness and are no longer considered contagious, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Thursday.	People who get infected with the coronavirus between Covid-19 vaccine shots can get their second dose after they've recovered from the illness and are no longer considered contagious, White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Thursday. Pfizer 's and Moderna 's Covid vaccines require two doses given three to four weeks apart. Both vaccines are about 95% effective against the virus, but that strong protection doesn't kick in until two weeks after the second dose, officials say. Some people have reported being diagnosed with Covid after receiving their first vaccine shot and before receiving their second shot. When that happens, Fauci said, they can get their second dose after they have recovered from the disease and have met the criteria for discontinuing isolation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , people who have had Covid-19 can be around others after a minimum of 10 days, 24 hours with no fever and when other symptoms, if any, are improving. Fauci also noted a small percentage of fully vaccinated people are still expected to contract Covid-19 – called "breakthrough cases." CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Monday that U.S. health officials confirmed fewer than 6,000 cases of Covid-19 out of 84 million Americans with full protection against the virus. Fauci said officials don't yet understand the risk of developing lingering symptoms, also known as "long Covid," after a breakthrough case post-vaccination.
President Biden is pledging to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030, in the latest push by the administration to aggressively combat climate change. “The question for me is whether we can even meet these targets because they are unbelievably ambitious given where we are today, and I don't think we yet have the policy tools or investments necessary to get us there,” said author David Wallace-Wells.	David Wallace-Wells, author of "The Uninhabitable Earth," questioned if the U.S. had the ability to actually meet President Joe Biden 's climate pledge of reducing the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% by 2030. "The question for me is whether we can even meet these targets because they are unbelievably ambitious given where we are today, and I don't think we yet have the policy tools or investments necessary to get us there," said Wallace-Wells. Biden convened a global summit to urge international cooperation on climate change. The summit represented a chance for the U.S. to rejoin global efforts on climate after former President Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris accord, halted all federal efforts to reduce domestic emissions and rolled back more than 100 environmental regulations to favor fossil fuel production. Wallace-Wells told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith" that the U.S. is doing what the world has to do as a whole, but ideally, the U.S. would be moving even faster to address climate change. "Since the U.S. is among the richest countries and among the most technologically advanced, among the most suited to making a fast transition, and because we've benefitted the most of any country in the world from the burning fossil fuels in the past, we really should be leading that pace rather than just meeting it," said the Deputy Editor at Large of "New York Magazine." Biden's new target more than doubles the Obama administration's prior commitment under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Nations under the Paris agreement are set to unveil updated emissions targets for the next decade at the U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, in November.
California State University and the University of California announced they will require all students, staff and faculty who plan to be on campus to be vaccinated against Covid. The two California university systems are the largest that will require vaccinations for the fall semester, with more than 1 million students and staff affected by the decision. Both universities are planning to operate mostly in-person for the semester.	California State University and the University of California announced Thursday they will require all students, staff and faculty who plan to be on campus to be vaccinated against Covid. The two California university systems are the largest among dozens of higher education institutions that will require vaccinations for the fall semester, with more than 1 million students and staff affected by the decision. Students and staff will be able to request exemptions based on medical or religious reasons as they would with other mandatory vaccines. "Together, the CSU and UC enroll and employ more than 1 million students and employees across 33 major university campuses, so this is the most comprehensive and consequential university plan for COVID-19 vaccines in the country," said Cal State Chancellor Joseph I. Castro. The universities hesitated to make the decision previously because of legal questions around requiring vaccines that have not been fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The Pfizer - BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are being distributed under emergency-use authorization, but the companies expect FDA approval by the fall. Both universities are planning to operate mostly in-person for the semester. Vaccines are a "key step people can take to protect themselves, their friends and family, and our campus communities while helping bring the pandemic to an end," said UC President Michael V. Drake, a physician. Some health experts believe that requiring vaccinations for college and universities will help stop the spread of Covid among young people, who have been increasingly at risk for severe illness from variants that are rapidly mutating and spreading . California recorded almost 2,000 new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday and a "double mutant" Covid variant was recently detected in the state. The state has plans to reopen businesses by June 15 while keeping a mask mandate in place. Almost half of adults in the state have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine.
A CDC advisory panel on Friday recommended the U.S. resume using the Johnson and Johnson Covid-19 vaccine. Members of the panel also proposed that the FDA include a warning label for women under age 50. The recommendation will pave the way for U.S. regulators to lift their recommended pause on using the J&J shot as early as this weekend.	A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel on Friday recommended the U.S. resume using the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine, saying the benefits outweigh the risks. Members of the panel didn't recommend U.S. regulators restrict the use of the vaccine based on age or gender, but they did propose that the FDA consider adding a warning label for women under age 50. The recommendation, which was adopted 10-4 with one abstention, by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, will pave the way for U.S. regulators to lift their recommended pause on using the J&J shot as early as this weekend. The single shot is a critical tool in getting lifesaving vaccines to hard-to-reach places that may not have reliable refrigeration, such as tribal lands , poorer neighborhoods and rural communities, as well as to people who may not be able to come back for a second dose, U.S. health officials say. The committee, an outside panel of experts that advises the CDC, decided to postpone a decision on the vaccine last week while officials continued to investigate cases of six women, ages 18 to 48, who developed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or CVST, in combination with low blood platelets within about two weeks of receiving the shot. The Food and Drug Administration and CDC on April 13 asked states to temporarily halt using J&J's vaccine "out of an abundance of caution" following reports of the rare blood clots. Within hours of the warning, more than a dozen states as well as some national pharmacies halted inoculations with J&J's vaccine, some replacing scheduled appointments with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Prior to Friday's vote, the committee debated whether to recommend against the use of J&J's vaccine or endorse it with U.S. regulators enforcing a warning label. The committee also considered limiting the vaccine's use based on age or other risk factors. CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in the brain's venous sinuses. It can prevent blood from draining out of the brain and can eventually cause a hemorrhage and other brain damage. The blood clots are similar to those reported in some individuals who received AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine. During Friday's meeting, Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, a CDC official, said there have been no reports of the condition in those who received the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine. There were three reports of CVST in patients who received the Moderna vaccine, he said, though the patients didn't have the low level of blood platelets seen in the J&J recipients. Blood platelets help the body form clots to heal wounds. U.S. health officials warned the use of a treatment like blood thinner heparin on those with low blood platelets could make their condition worse. Rare blood clots with low platelets are occurring with the J&J shot at a rate of 7 per 1 million vaccinations in women ages 18 to 49 and 0.9 per 1 million in women ages 50 and older, according to a slide presented at the CDC panel meeting. CDC has confirmed 15 cases total of rare blood clot conditions, which includes 12 women who developed blood clots in the brain. Three women have died and 7 remain hospitalized, according to the slides. There are no confirmed cases in men, though officials have said they are reviewing potential additional cases. Dr. Michael Streiff, a hematologist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said the condition, in normal circumstances, is very rare. "I can tell you from my experience, treating these patients, I've just never seen it," he told the committee during a presentation Friday. A CDC model presented at the meeting showed not resuming the use of J&J's vaccine would delay immunizing all adults intending to get the shots by 14 days. J&J executives told the committee the benefits of its vaccine still outweighed its risks, adding that the shots would prevent deaths and hospitalizations. They suggested a new warning label for the vaccine that explains the risk of blood clots. "We could expect that if 1 million people in the United States were vaccinated with the J&J single-dose vaccine, there would be over 2,000 fewer deaths and 6,000 fewer Covid-related hospitalizations," said Dr. Joanne Waldstreicher, J&J's chief medical officer. Earlier this week, J&J said it would resume the rollout of its vaccine in Europe after regulators there backed the single-shot vaccine with the recommendation that a warning be added to the label. The European Medicines Agency researched all available evidence, it said, including the reports from the United States. Last week, U.S. health officials said they expected the pause on the use of the vaccine to last only a matter of days, depending on what they learn in their investigation of the cases. Before the CDC meeting, Dr. Wilbur Chen, a member of the committee, told CNBC that he saw "a huge amount of evidence" that the benefits of the J&J vaccine still outweigh its risks. "I think that there is a willingness for us to use this vaccine. We did need to make an important pause to be able to look at this safety information to be able to consider the risks. But certainly, I think there's a huge amount of evidence that the benefit greatly outweighs this risk," Chen, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, told " Worldwide Exchange."

A preliminary report from the largest study on Covid vaccine safety in pregnant women shows that Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines are safe to use during pregnancy. The researchers found no "obvious safety signals" in any of the 35,691 people followed. The peer-reviewed study was published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending Covid-19 shots for pregnant women after preliminary data from the largest study of coronavirus vaccine use among expectant mothers showed that Pfizer 's and Moderna 's jabs were safe for the women as well as their babies. The researchers found no "obvious safety signals" among any of the 35,691 women who were followed in the peer-reviewed study published Wednesday by The New England Journal of Medicine. Data used in the research was self-reported, and the participants' ages ranged from 16 to 54 years old. "No safety concerns were observed for people vaccinated in the third trimester or safety concerns for their babies," CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Friday. "As such, CDC recommends pregnant people receive Covid-19 vaccines." The researchers used the "v-safe after vaccination health checker" surveillance system, the v-safe pregnancy registry and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System to characterize the initial safety of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant women, according to the study. Pregnant women, versus those who weren't, reported injection-site pain more frequently, but fewer other side effects such as headache, myalgia, chills and fever, the study found. Of the 827 participants who completed their pregnancy, rates of miscarriage were the same as rates observed before the pandemic. The findings are preliminary and covered just the first 11 weeks of the U.S. vaccine rollout, from Dec. 14 to Feb. 28. Pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized and run a higher risk of death when infected with Covid-19, making vaccination especially important to this demographic, according to CDC data. Pharmaceutical companies did not include pregnant women in early efficacy and safety studies, but evidence is mounting from recent studies that the vaccines are safe for them. Researchers said "more longitudinal follow-up, including follow-up of large numbers of women vaccinated earlier in pregnancy, is necessary to inform maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes."
U.S. health regulators lifted a recommended pause on the use of Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine, giving state and local officials backing to distribute the doses. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended on Friday the continued use of the J&J vaccine. On April 13, the FDA and CDC asked states to temporarily halt using J&J's vaccine "out of an abundance of caution" following reports that six women, ages 18 to 48, developed a rare blood clotting disorder.	U.S. health regulators on Friday lifted a recommended pause on the use of Johnson & Johnson 's Covid-19 vaccine, giving state and local officials backing to distribute the doses, which are seen as critical in getting lifesaving shots to hard-to-reach communities. The announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration comes after the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP, recommended earlier Friday for the continued use of the J&J vaccine , saying the benefits of the shot outweighed the risk. The committee is an outside panel of experts that advises the CDC. Members of the advisory panel didn't recommend U.S. regulators restrict the use of the J&J vaccine based on age or gender, but they did propose that the Food and Drug Administration consider adding a warning label for women under the age of 50. In a statement late Friday, the FDA and CDC said they were confident that the vaccine is safe and effective in preventing Covid-19, adding the risk of the blood clots is "very low." "Safety is our top priority," Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said in a statement. "This pause was an example of our extensive safety monitoring working as they were designed to work—identifying even these small number of cases." "We've lifted the pause based on the FDA and CDC's review of all available data and in consultation with medical experts and based on recommendations from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices," Woodcock said. "We have concluded that the known and potential benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older." During a press conference on the announcement, Woodcock said health-care providers should review revised fact sheets from the FDA about the vaccine, which includes details about rare blood clots. People who have questions about the vaccine should discuss with a health-care provider, she said. J&J's Covid-19 vaccine, like Pfizer 's and Moderna 's shots, received an emergency use authorization from the FDA to start distributing the doses across the U.S. An EUA grants conditional clearance based on two months of safety data, pending another submission for full approval, which usually requires at least six months of data. On April 13, the FDA and CDC asked states to temporarily halt using J&J's vaccine "out of an abundance of caution" following reports that six women, ages 18 to 48, developed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in combination with low blood platelets. CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in the brain's venous sinuses. It can prevent blood from draining out of the brain and can eventually cause a hemorrhage and other brain damage. Within hours of the warning from U.S. regulators, more than a dozen states, along with some national pharmacies, halted inoculations with J&J's vaccine. Some locations replaced the J&J shots for scheduled appointments with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. The U.S. government was expected to lift the recommended pause shortly after the favorable vote from the committee. Prior to Friday's vote, the committee debated whether to recommend against the use of J&J's vaccine or endorse it with U.S. regulators enforcing a warning label. The committee also considered limiting the vaccine's use based on age or other risk factors. During the meeting, CDC official Dr. Tom Shimabukuro said there have been no reports of the condition in those who received the Pfizer- BioNTech mRNA vaccine. There were three reports of CVST in patients who received the Moderna vaccine, he said, though the patients didn't have the low level of blood platelets seen in the J&J recipients. Blood platelets help the body form clots to heal wounds. U.S. health officials warned the use of a treatment like blood thinner heparin on those with low blood platelets could make their condition worse. Rare blood clots with low platelets are occurring at a rate of 7 per 1 million vaccinations in women ages 18 to 49 for the J&J shot and 0.9 per 1 million in women age 50 and older, according to a slide presented at the CDC panel meeting. CDC has confirmed 15 cases total of rare blood clot conditions, which includes 12 women who developed blood clots in the brain. Three women died and 7 remained hospitalized, according to the presentation. There are no confirmed cases in men, though officials have said they are reviewing potential additional cases.

Summertime in the United States could return to a pre-Covid-19 normal if 75% to 80% of the U.S. population is vaccinated, Dr. Peter Hotez said, but vaccine hesitancy could stop that from happening. Polls show that more than 40% of Republicans are not planning to get vaccinated “That's where we've got to work harder, at reaching conservative groups.... that we have to fix,” Hotez said.	Summertime in the United States could return to a pre-Covid-19 normal if 75% to 80% of the U.S. population is vaccinated, Dr. Peter Hotez said Friday. "We can vaccinate our way out of this epidemic if all the adults and adolescents get vaccinated by summer. We can have an extraordinary quality of life, with going back to concerts and music venues and ball games and bars and restaurants, and clubs, and all the things we like to do, so that's what we have to work towards," Hotez said. Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital, told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith," that vaccine hesitancy, however, will prevent the U.S. from getting 75% to 80% of the population vaccinated. Demand for the Covid-19 vaccine has dropped across states . Louisiana, for example, asked for fewer doses because demand was so low. Polls show that more than 40% of Republicans are not planning to get vaccinated, and Hotez advised that healthcare professionals work to address conservative groups in order to help protect the entire U.S. population. "About 40% to 45% of Republicans saying they may not take the vaccine or won't take the vaccine, and when you add up the numbers, that's about 10% of the adult population," said Hotez. "That's where we've got to work harder, at reaching conservative groups.... that we have to fix."
Germany has implemented tough new lockdown rules to curb a third wave of infections. The measures could last until June. Curfews, shopping and leisure center closures and limits on household contacts are part of new measures. Protests have been seen in several cities.	Germany has implemented tough lockdown rules in a bid to curb a third wave of infections, issuing a set of new measures expected to last until June. Protests have been seen in several German cities after the restrictions were introduced this weekend on coronavirus hot spots. A curfew, limits on customers in shops, leisure center closures and limits on household contacts are part of the measures. Germany has been struggling to suppress a third wave, largely attributed to the spread of a more infectious strain of the virus that first emerged in the U.K. last fall. Enacting a "nationwide emergency brake," cities or districts that exceed a seven-day incidence rate of 100 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants over three consecutive days must now implement the lockdowns. Schools are to close if incidence rates are above 165 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants for three days in a row. Data from the Robert Koch Institute , Germany's public health body, shows that all but one of Germany's 16 states are above the threshold for the emergency brake to kick in, and seven states have an incidence rate above 165 . The nationwide seven-day average of cases per 100,000 people stood at 169.3 on Monday . The measures, set out in the Infection Protection Act, effectively expand the federal government's authority to control the pandemic. Germany's states have been largely able to set their own rules, leading to variations across the country with some states reluctant to impose stricter measures despite a surge in infections. Nonetheless, the measures — and, particularly, the curfew, which will run from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. and allows people to leave their homes only if they must go to or from work, seek medical assistance or take a dog for a walk — have provoked fury among some members of the public, with small demonstrations taking place in several cities at the weekend, notably Frankfurt and Hanover. German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended the new rules, urging compliance. "If we succeed now in reducing infections significantly and quickly, step-by-step relaxations will be possible in the foreseeable future," she said in her weekly video podcast. "Let us now once again do what is necessary and together show consideration and responsibility." "What we're hearing from doctors and the nursing staff, these are real cries for help," she said. "We — the state, society, citizens — we all have to help," she added. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that he didn't think the measures would be eased before the end of May while German Health Minister Jens Spahn told the German Parliament, the Bundestag, that "the situation is serious, very serious." While vaccinations and testing provide some way out of the pandemic, only "reducing contacts and thus reducing transmission of the infection" can contain the third wave, Spahn said. The new measures could further dent the popularity of Merkel's ruling conservative alliance, the Christian Democratic Union and its sister party, the Christian Social Union. A second voter poll has now put the Green Party ahead of the CDU-CSU bloc. The poll by Kantar for Bild am Sonntag put support for the Greens at 28%, 1 percentage point above support for the CDU-CSU. If the Greens' positive momentum continues and is borne out in the September federal election , the Greens could be the most powerful influence in a likely coalition government with the conservative bloc.
The U.K.'s flash composite purchasing managers' index reading for April surged to 60 from 56.4 in March, its highest level since November 2013. Retail sales also beat expectations in March to climb 5.4% from the previous month, while a GfK survey showed British consumer sentiment this month rising to its highest point since the pandemic. Goldman Sachs has now upped its growth forecast to a "striking" 7.8% for 2021.	Goldman Sachs has upgraded its forecasts for the U.K. economy in 2021, and now sees it outpacing the U.S. The U.K.'s flash composite purchasing managers' index reading for April surged to 60 from 56.4 in March, its highest level since November 2013 and a far sharper incline than anticipated, as the country embarks on a phased exit from nationwide lockdown measures . Retail sales also vastly outstripped expectations in March to climb 5.4% from the previous month, while a GfK survey showed British consumer sentiment this month rising to its highest point since the pandemic. "Moreover, Covid case growth has remained low and the vaccine roll-out has surged ahead, with half of the population vaccinated. We therefore see the government's reopening plans as on track, with phase 3 to start on May 17," Goldman chief European economist Sven Jari Stehn said in a research note Sunday night. "As a result, we expect very strong growth in the April and May data, and remain comfortable with our 5.5% (not annualized) growth forecast for Q2," Stehn added. Almost 33.7 million people have now received their first vaccine dose in the U.K., with daily Covid-19 cases falling steadily to 1,712 on Sunday. Monthly GDP in the U.K. increased 0.4% in February, roughly in line with expectations, but following recent upward revisions to real GDP and last week's strong indicators, Goldman Sachs has now upped its growth forecast to a "striking" 7.8% for the whole of 2021. In February, the Wall Street titan upped its forecasts for U.S. growth in 2021 to 6.8%, while the International Monetary Fund currently projects 6.4% growth in the U.S. and 5.3% in the U.K. The U.K. economy shrank by 9.9% in 2020 , according to the Office for National Statistics, its largest annual contraction since the Great Frost of 1709 as the country was forced into strict lockdown measures for longer periods than many of its European peers. U.S. GDP shrank 3.5% in 2020 , the largest decline since 1946, when the U.S. demobilized after World War II. Stehn's view was supported over the weekend by JPMorgan economist Allan Monks, who noted that a gradual detachment of mobility measures from economic performance bodes well for the U.K.'s economic recovery. This would mean that the country's GDP growth is more likely to remain on course even without a full return to office working and unencumbered travel. "The linkage between the two has weakened over time, in sectors involving both higher and lower levels of social contact. But the relationship involving workplace mobility and the broader economy, i.e., where social contact is the lowest, is the weakest," Monks said in a research note. "Together with survey evidence of sharp increases in both household and business expectations for the future, this raises our confidence that a significant GDP rebound is possible without a full normalization in mobility."
Dr. Anthony Fauci said he expects the U.S. to reach a turning point in the coronavirus pandemic within a few weeks if the current pace of vaccinations holds. The U.S. is pushing to vaccinate adults as quickly as possible as highly contagious variants spread. Fauci said herd immunity to the virus is a "moving target."	White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Monday that Americans should begin to see a turning point in the pandemic "within a few weeks." The United States has been averaging about 3 million Covid-19 vaccination shots per day, Fauci said. Meanwhile, the nation reported a seven-day average of 58,164 new Covid cases per day as of Sunday, according to a CNBC analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That's down 14% from a week ago. If the U.S. continues its vaccination pace, "literally within a few weeks, we're going to start to see a turning around of the dynamics," Fauci said Monday during a virtual event hosted by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. "Not down to no infections," he said. "If you're waiting for classic measles-like herd immunity, that's going to be a while before we get there. But that doesn't mean we're not going to have a significant diminution in the number of infections per day and a significant diminution in all of the parameters, namely hospitalizations and deaths." The Biden administration has pushed Americans to get vaccinated as quickly as possible as new, highly contagious variants spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier this month that the B.1.1.7 variant, which appears to be more deadly and spread more easily than other strains, is now the most common Covid strain circulating in the U.S. U.S. health officials say they are concerned the highly contagious variant, first identified in the U.K., could stall the nation's progress on the pandemic. The outbreak has killed at least 572,287 Americans in a little over a year. Still, vaccinations are being administered at a rapid pace. More than 139 million Americans, or 42.2% of the total U.S. population, had received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine as of Sunday, according to the CDC. Roughly 94.7 million people, or 28.5% of the population, are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Last week, the Biden administration announced a massive campaign to persuade more Americans, particularly young people, to take the Covid-19 vaccines as supply begins to outpace demand in some parts of the U.S. Fauci has said the goal is to vaccinate between 70% and 85% of the U.S. population — or roughly 232 million to 281 million people — to achieve herd immunity and suppress the pandemic. But he said Monday that herd immunity is a "moving target." The U.S. should just focus on getting as many Americans vaccinated as possible, Fauci said. "We don't know what the durability of the infection-induced immunity is. We don't know if someone who got infected last winter or in the early part of 2020 is going to be safe from a protected standpoint now," he said.
The United States will share 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine with other countries. Cases continue to spike around the world. New infections in the U.S. have slowed, and the Biden administration said it would make materials for vaccine production available to India as the country deals with a surge of cases.	The United States will share 60 million doses of AstraZeneca 's Covid-19 vaccine with other countries as coronavirus cases continue to spike worldwide, a top U.S. official said Monday. Andy Slavitt, a senior advisor to President Joe Biden 's Covid-19 response team, said the U.S. government will share the AstraZeneca shots as they become available. The Food and Drug Administration has not yet authorized the vaccine for use in the U.S. The U.S. will not distribute any doses of the vaccine unless they meet the FDA's expectations for "product quality," senior administration officials told reporters during a press briefing Monday. The administration expects the U.S. could release 10 million doses of the vaccine "in the coming weeks," pending FDA clearance, one official said. An additional 50 million doses could be distributed in May and June, the official said. "As part of the U.S. strategy to be ready for a range of scenarios, the United States has produced some AstraZeneca doses already," the official said. "Given the strong portfolio of vaccines that the United States already has, as I mentioned, and given that the AstraZeneca vaccine is not approved for use in the U.S., we do not need to use AstraZeneca vaccine here during the next few months." The move comes as state and local health officials say Covid vaccine supply is beginning to outpace demand in some regions of the U.S. More than 139 million Americans, or 42.2% of the total U.S. population, have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roughly 94.7 million people, or 28.5% of the population, are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. The rate of Covid vaccinations in the U.S. slid over the weekend, according to CDC data. The seven-day average of daily shots reported administered fell to 2.8 million on Sunday, the lowest level since late March. U.S. health officials say the nation does not need the AstraZeneca vaccine to meet its goal of having enough doses for all U.S. adults by the end of May. Biden previously said he expected the U.S. to share its surplus of vaccine doses with other countries. China and Russia have also shared vaccines with other countries. A day earlier, the Biden administration said it would immediately make raw materials needed for India's coronavirus vaccine production available as the country works to counter a surge of Covid-19 infections. Over the past seven days, India has reported an average of about 321,000 new Covid-19 cases per day, up 50% from a week ago, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The country is averaging about 2,300 Covid deaths per day, according to the Hopkins data. Media reports indicate the official figure is being understated. Cases are also surging worldwide. The World Health Organization said earlier this month the number of new Covid-19 cases per week has nearly doubled over the past two months, pushing global infections toward their highest level in the pandemic. The WHO has urged wealthier nations, such as the U.S., to donate vaccines to poorer or developing countries. — CNBC's Nate Rattner and Amanda Macias contributed to this report.
The White House hopes to push Congress to pass a law requiring the U.S. grid to get 80% of its power from emissions-free sources by 2030. The goal would fall short of President Joe Biden's stated ambition of net-zero carbon emissions in the grid by 2035. Requiring utilities to move away from coal and natural gas is a cornerstone of Biden's plan to slash greenhouse gas emissions in half across the U.S. economy in the next decade.	The White House hopes to capitalize on growing support from U.S. utilities, unions and green groups for a national clean energy mandate by pushing Congress to pass a law requiring the U.S. grid to get 80% of its power from emissions-free sources by 2030, according to a senior administration official. The goal would fall short of President Joe Biden's stated ambition of net-zero carbon emissions in the grid by 2035, but is an interim milestone that could be passed without Republican support through a process called budget reconciliation. "Our goal is to enact this into law," deputy White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi told Reuters. "There are multiple pathways to get meaningful progress in the power sector. We think this is a really powerful one in terms of giving utilities a clear and clean planning horizon." Requiring utilities to move away from coal and natural gas is a cornerstone of Biden's plan to slash greenhouse gas emissions in half across the U.S. economy in the next decade. The country's grid is currently 40% clean, but getting to 80% by 2030 could be achieved with existing technologies at no additional cost to ratepayers in every region because the cost of renewables and batteries have come down so much, according to a new analysis by researchers at Energy Innovation and the University of California, Berkeley. A so-called clean energy standard would require reductions in emissions by adopting renewables like wind and solar, using nuclear energy or finding ways to suck up and sequester greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel plants. The policy has support from members of both parties in Congress, though Republicans have not embraced the administration's aggressive timeline due to concerns that it will drive up costs and kill jobs in fossil fuel industries. Democrats could pass a CES with a simple majority as a revision of budget legislation if the CES sets a 2030 target since reconciliation measures must fall within a 10-year window. The Senate is currently divided 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, but Democrats have control because Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie. Legislation outside of the reconciliation process would need 60 votes to bypass a potential Republican procedural move known as a filibuster. The White House is weighing various legislative options and speaking to lawmakers in both parties. Many utilities already have plans to remove carbon from their systems due to investor pressure or state mandates, so they broadly support the policy. They are concerned , however, that technological breakthroughs needed to reach zero emissions may not materialize in time to meet a 2035 timeline. This month, 13 major utilities sent a letter to Biden in support of a power sector goal that would cut emissions by 80% below 2005 levels by 2030 . "We want to position the United States to take full economic advantage of what the technological innovation positions us to do," Zaidi said. "We are calling our shot and we are going in that direction."
Organizers of the recall effort against California Gov. Gavin Newsom collected enough valid signatures to qualify for the ballot. The California secretary of state's office announced Monday that more than 1.6 million signatures had been verified, about 100,000 more than needed to force a vote on the first-term Democrat. In 2003, voters recalled Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and replaced him with Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.	Organizers of the recall effort against California Gov. Gavin Newsom collected enough valid signatures to qualify for the ballot. The California secretary of state's office announced Monday that more than 1.6 million signatures had been verified, about 100,000 more than needed to force a vote on the first-term Democrat. People who signed petitions now have 30 days to withdraw their signatures, though it's unlikely enough will do so to stop the question from going to voters. An election is likely in the fall where voters would face two questions: Should Newsom be recalled and who should replace him? The votes on the second question will only be counted if more than half say yes to the first. If Newsom survives the recall he will be up for reelection in 2022. Among the most prominent Republicans running to replace Newsom are former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner, who has never run for elected office. Businessman John Cox, who lost badly to Newsom in 2018, and former Congressman Doug Ose, also are running. In 2003, voters recalled Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and replaced him with Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's the only other recall of a California governor to qualify for the ballot. Newsom won election in 2018 with support from more than 60% of voters. Recalling him will be a tough sell in the heavily Democratic state where just a quarter of the state's registered voters are Republicans, about the same number as those who identify as "no party preference." But organizers see an opening by energizing voters who were angered by Newsom's handling of the pandemic and those frustrated by one-party rule in Sacramento. Republicans have not won statewide office since 2006, when voters gave Schwarzenegger a second term. Newsom's pandemic actions tipped the recall effort over the edge, especially after he was caught last fall dining at a fancy restaurant for a lobbyist's birthday while urging residents to stay home. Organizers began working to remove him from office before the coronavirus took hold in California. Orrin Heatlie, a retired county sheriff's sergeant, decided to pursue a recall after seeing Newsom explaining the rights of immigrants living in the country illegally. He and other Republicans were also frustrated by many of Newsom's liberal policy decisions. Dozens of other candidates, serious and not, are expected to enter the race. So far no other Democrats have announced plans to run against Newsom. The governor launched an anti-recall campaign in March, crafting the effort as one driven by Republican extremists and adherents to former President Donald Trump, who lost California twice.
A new Singapore-inspired tax law will reduce corporate income tax and boost foreign investment in the Philippines, its finance secretary has said. The so-called CREATE act grants financial relief to companies in need while increasing the country's competitiveness, Carlos Dominguez told CNBC. The law reduces the corporate income tax rate — formerly the highest among Southeast Asian nations at 30% — to 25% for large companies and 20% for small businesses.	A new Singapore-inspired tax law will reduce corporate income tax and boost foreign investment in the Philippines, finance secretary Carlos Dominguez told CNBC, as the country moves to speed up its economic recovery. The Philippines' so-called corporate recovery and tax incentives for enterprises (CREATE) act, which was signed into law last month, aims to provide financial relief to companies in need while increasing the country's competitiveness within the region, he told CNBC Tuesday. The law reduces the corporate income tax rate — formerly the highest among Southeast Asian nations at 30% — to 25% for large companies and 20% for small businesses. It also unifies the government's inbound investment program, bringing it closer in line with financial hubs like Singapore, and granting the president more powers to give non-fiscal incentives to businesses, Dominguez said. "We patterned our program after the Singaporean system," he said in reference to its coordinated strategy of attracting and incentivizing overseas investments. "In the past we had 13 independent investment promoting agencies in the country, and they were hardly ever coordinated," he continued. "Now we are coordinating them and we are making sure that these agencies provide incentives that are transparent, that are time-bound, that are performance-based, and attract the investments that we actually want in this country." The reduced corporate tax is the latest in a series of tax reforms introduced by President Rodrigo  Duterte's PDP-Laban party since coming into power in 2016. The finance secretary said the plans will return cash to distressed small- and medium-sized businesses, which can then reinvest in jobs and economic growth. However, critics have questioned the merits of reducing already stressed public finances as the country battles the coronavirus pandemic. "The chunk we are giving up, we estimate is around 1 trillion pesos ($20.65 billion) over a period of 10 years. However, we think this is a time to do it," said Dominguez. "The businesses need fiscal stimulus, number one. And secondly, that it will attract more investments into our country over the long period of time," he said. The Philippines has so far retained its BBB credit rating from Fitch Ratings , BAA2 from Moody's , and BBB+ from Japan's Rating and Investment Information (R&I) agency . That's despite the global downturn and its disproportionate impact on emerging markets. "Not only the credit rating agencies, but the people who actually put their money where their mouth is, have been investing in the long-term viability and prospects of the Philippines," he said, referencing strong bond trading activity. The finance secretary's comments come as the Philippines faces a spike in cases in its capital Manila. Dominguez said the country's resources are currently "adequate" to deal with the surge, adding that it has ordered enough vaccines to inoculate its 70 million adult population by the end of this year. "This Covid contagion is just a blip in our history. We still have our strong fundamentals, which are our very strong fiscal and monetary system in the Philippines," said Dominguez. "We have our very young and talented workforce, and we have improved the infrastructure so far. So this CREATE (law) will just add to our ability to attract more investments into this country."
Pfizer's experimental oral drug to treat Covid-19 at the first sign of illness could be available by the end of the year, CEO Albert Bourla told CNBC on Tuesday. The drug is part of a class of medicines called protease inhibitors and works by inhibiting an enzyme that the virus needs to replicate in human cells. Protease inhibitors are used to treat other viral pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis C.	Pfizer 's experimental oral drug to treat Covid-19 at the first sign of illness could be available by the end of the year, CEO Albert Bourla told CNBC on Tuesday. The company, which developed the first authorized Covid-19 vaccine in the U.S. with German drugmaker BioNTech , began in March an early stage clinical trial testing a new antiviral therapy for the disease. The drug is part of a class of medicines called protease inhibitors and works by inhibiting an enzyme that the virus needs to replicate in human cells. Protease inhibitors are used to treat other viral pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis C. If clinical trials go well and the Food and Drug Administration approves it, the drug could be distributed across the U.S. by the end of the year, Bourla told CNBC's " Squawk Box ." Health experts say the drug, taken by mouth, could be a game changer because people newly infected with the virus could use it outside of hospitals. Researchers hope the medication will keep the disease from progressing and prevent hospital trips. In addition to the drug, Pfizer is still testing its vaccine in 6-month to 11-year-old children. Vaccinating children is crucial to ending the coronavirus pandemic , public health officials and infectious disease experts say. Earlier this month, the company asked the FDA to expand its vaccine authorization to adolescents ages 12 to 15 after the shot was found to be 100% effective in a study. Bourla told CNBC on Tuesday he is "very optimistic" that the FDA will approve use of the shot in adolescents.
The risk of being exposed to Covid-19 indoors can be as great at 60 feet as it is at 6 feet in a room where the air is mixed. Existing safety guidelines have omitted too many factors to accurately quantify the risk of airborne transmission, such as time, mask use and ventilation rates. Bazant and Bush question long-held Covid-19 guidelines that recommend 6 feet of distance between people.	The risk of being exposed to Covid-19 indoors can be as great at 60 feet as it is at 6 feet in a room where the air is mixed — even when wearing a mask, according to a new study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers who challenge social distancing guidelines adopted across the world. MIT professors Martin Z. Bazant, who teaches chemical engineering and applied mathematics, and John W.M. Bush, who teaches applied mathematics, developed a method of calculating exposure risk to Covid-19 in an indoor setting that factors in a variety of issues that could affect transmission, including the amount of time spent inside, air filtration and circulation, immunization, variant strains, mask use, and even respiratory activity such as breathing, eating, speaking or singing. Bazant and Bush question long-held Covid-19 guidelines that recommend 6 feet of distance between people from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a peer-reviewed study published earlier this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America. They say staying 6 feet away from another person may not be enough when people are inside for prolonged periods of time. "We argue there really isn't much of a benefit to the 6-foot rule, especially when people are wearing masks" since everyone in the room is breathing the same air, Bazant said in an interview. "It really has almost no physical basis because the air a person is breathing while wearing a mask tends to rise and comes down elsewhere in the room so you're more exposed to the average background than you are to a person at a distance." Without masks, however, Bazant said 6 feet would provide some additional protection against Covid-19 versus 3 feet. That's particularly true if a person is breathing directly in your direction, creating what scientists call a "respiratory plume," like a puff of smoke from a smoker. Their research was based on models that assume the air in the room is "well mixed" and that "the pathogen is distributed uniformly throughout," they said in a follow-up statement to CNBC on Monday. In well-mixed spaces, "one is no safer from airborne pathogens at 60 feet than 6 feet," they said. The important variable CDC and World Health Organization guidelines have overlooked is the amount of time spent indoors, Bazant said. The longer someone is inside with an infected person, the greater the chance of transmission, he said. Opening windows or installing new fans to keep the air moving could also be just as effective or more effective than spending large amounts of money on a new filtration system, he said. Bazant also says that guidelines enforcing indoor occupancy caps are flawed. He said 20 people gathered inside for one minute is probably fine, but not over the course of several hours, he said. Small, poorly ventilated spaces where a lot of people spend a lot of time together places people at the most risk, he said. "Unfortunately, the nursing home is one of those cases. If Covid patients are living together 24/7, in some cases even in the same room, that is the absolute worst-case scenario, especially given the vulnerability of that population," Bazant added. On the other hand, their analysis shows that many places that were shut down didn't necessarily need to close, he said. "Often times the space is large enough, the ventilation is good enough, the amount of time people spend together is such that those spaces can be safely operated even at full capacity and the scientific support for reduced capacity in those spaces is really not very good," Bazant said, citing some university classrooms. "I think if you run the numbers, even right now for many types of spaces you'd find that there is not a need for occupancy restrictions." Social distancing and occupancy rules that have resulted in closed businesses and schools are oversimplified, according to Bazant. "This emphasis on distancing has been really misplaced from the very beginning. The CDC or WHO have never really provided justification for it, they've just said this is what you must do and the only justification I'm aware of, is based on studies of coughs and sneezes, where they look at the largest particles that might sediment onto the floor and even then it's very approximate, you can certainly have longer or shorter range, large droplets," Bazant said. "The distancing isn't helping you that much and it's also giving you a false sense of security because you're as safe at 6 feet as you are at 60 feet if you're indoors and the air is getting well mixed. Everyone in that space is at roughly the same risk, actually," he noted. Pathogen-laced droplets travel through the air indoors when people talk, breathe or eat. It is now known that airborne transmission plays a huge role in the spread of Covid-19, compared with the earlier months of the pandemic where hand-washing was considered the leading recommendation to avoid transmission. Those droplets from a person's warm exhalation mix with body heat and air currents in the area to rise and travel throughout the entire room and put everyone in a well-mixed room at risk of airborne transmission. People seem to be more exposed to that "background" air than they are by droplets from a distance, like secondhand smoke, according to the study. For example, if someone infected with Covid-19 is wearing a mask and singing loudly in an enclosed room, a person who is sitting at the other side of the room is not more protected than someone who is sitting just 6 feet away from the infected person. This is why time spent in the enclosed area is more important than how far you are from the infected person. Masks work in general to prevent transmission by blocking larger droplets, therefore larger droplets aren't making up the majority of Covid infections when most people are wearing masks. The majority of people who are transmitting Covid aren't coughing and sneezing, they're asymptomatic, Bazant said. Masks prevent indoor transmission by both filtering exhaled infectious droplets and blocking exhaled jets of air, best visualized by imagining someone exhaling smoke. Exposure to these jets of infectious air results in a higher risk of transmission, relative to that of the well-mixed background, Bazant said he and Bush determined in an earlier study . Masks help indoor transmission by both filtering exhaled infectious droplets and blocking exhaled jets of air, which can be seen when a smoker exhales. Exposure to exhaled jets of infectious air results in a higher risk of transmission, relative to that of the well-mixed background, Bazant and Bush said. Those in the same room as a smoker are heavily affected by the secondhand smoke that makes its way around the enclosed area and lingers. The same logic applies to infectious airborne droplets in well-mixed room, according to the study. When indoors and masked, factors besides distance can be more important to consider to avoid transmission. Though Bazant and Bush's study didn't specifically look at outdoor transmission, Bazant said social distancing makes little sense outdoors since warmer air that's exhaled tends to rise and any infected air would be swept away by the wind. "Air follows the path of least resistance and often times with many masks, that's straight up," Bazant said. "Exhaled air is obviously much warmer than the background and tends to rise. That's, by the way, the main reason that distancing outside makes almost no sense, and especially with masks, it's even kind of crazy because you're really not going to transmit to someone at 6 feet. "If you look at the air flow outside, the infected air would be essentially swept away and very unlikely to cause transmission. There are very few recorded instances of outdoor transmission," he said. Though rare, he said it's always possible to contract Covid-19 outdoors, especially at crowded venues like concerts. "Crowded spaces outdoor could be an issue, but if people are keeping a reasonable distance of like 3 feet outside, I feel pretty comfortable with that even without masks frankly." As for variant strains that are 60% more transmissible, increasing ventilation by 60%, reducing the amount of time spent inside or limiting the number of people indoors could offset that risk, he said. Bazant also said that a big question that is coming will be when masks can be removed, and that the study's guidelines can help quantify the risks involved. He also noted that measuring carbon dioxide in a room can also help quantify how much infected air is present and hence risk of transmission. "We need scientific information conveyed to the public in a way that is not just fearmongering but is actually based in analysis," Bazant said. After three rounds of heavy peer review, he said it's the most review he's ever been through, and that now that it's published he hopes it will influence policy. Bush and Bazant issued a statement to CNBC on Monday clarifying some of Bazant's previous comments. "Our study indicates that the six-foot rule is insufficient to limit indoor airborne transmission of COVID-19: one must also limit the time spent in an indoor space. Our study demonstrates how this time limit depends on the relevant factors, including room ventilation and filtration and face-mask use," they said, noting that "face masks can be an extremely effective indoor safety measure." Editor's note: The headline and article were updated to add more quotes and context to the scientists' findings and opinions. Bazant said his comments on outdoor transmission were his opinion, not the formal findings of the study.
The CDC relaxed mask guidance for fully vaccinated people Tuesday, saying they can do things like exercise and attend small gatherings outdoors without wearing a face mask. “I think the President made the right point today, which is that guidance today is not about politics, it's a data-driven recommendation that is based on how we see these vaccines behaving in the wild,” Dr. Mario Ramirez said. Ramirez said while the U.S. is trending in the right direction, officials will have to engage in a "persistent messaging campaign" in order to convince skeptical Americans to get vaccinated.	Former Health and Human Services official Dr. Mario Ramirez cheered President Joe Biden 's support of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's masking updates on Tuesday . "I think the president made the right point today, which is that guidance today is not about politics, it's a data-driven recommendation that is based on how we see these vaccines behaving in the wild," said Ramirez. The CDC said fully vaccinated people can exercise and attend small gatherings outdoors without wearing a face mask. Biden said the new recommendations underscore the progress that the U.S. has made in beating back Covid. Ramirez, a former HHS pandemic and emerging threats coordinator in the Office of Global Affairs, told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith" that while the U.S. is trending in the right direction when it comes to vaccinations, officials will have to engage in a "persistent messaging campaign" in order to convince skeptical Americans to get vaccinated. In the U.S., 232 million vaccine jabs have been put into arms, according to CDC data , with 43% of the total population having received at least one dose and nearly 20% of the country fully vaccinated. Dr. Peter Hotez told "The News with Shepard Smith" on Friday that summertime in the United States could return to a pre-Covid-19 normal if 75% to 80% of the U.S. population is vaccinated. Ramirez said that an improvement in vaccine convenience will be another helpful step to getting more Americans vaccinated. "One of the things we're looking forward to in the fall is whether vaccine manufacturers can actually bundle a flu and a coronavirus vaccine together, if we can do that, it will go a long way to improving uptake of the vaccine," said Ramirez.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said fully vaccinated people can exercise outdoors or with members of their household without a mask. The CDC added that fully vaccinated people can hold small gatherings outdoors with others who are inoculated, or with a mix of unvaccinated people, without face coverings. The agency did not define how big those gatherings can be, and said Americans should still wear masks in crowded outdoor spaces.	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its public health guidance Tuesday, saying fully vaccinated people can exercise and attend small gatherings outdoors without wearing a face mask. People two weeks removed from their last vaccine can exercise alone or with other household members outside without a face covering, the CDC said. They can also meet outdoors with a small group of other fully vaccinated people, or a mixture of fully vaccinated and unvaccinated people, the agency added. The guidance did not say what counts as a small gathering. Dining unmasked at an outdoor restaurant with friends from multiple households is also acceptable, according to the CDC. The agency still recommends that fully vaccinated people wear a mask at outdoor spaces where the risk of Covid-19 is less clear. Those include sporting events, concerts, parades and other crowded places. "In public spaces, the vaccination status of other people or whether they are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 is likely unknown," the CDC wrote in its guidance. "Therefore, fully vaccinated people should continue to follow guidance to protect themselves and others, including wearing a well-fitted mask, when indoors or in an outdoor setting or venue where masks are required." "CDC cannot provide the specific risk level for every activity in every community, so it is important to consider your own personal situation and the risk to you, your family, and your community before venturing out without a mask," the agency added. Some former health officials and infectious disease experts have been saying outdoor mask mandates are no longer necessary as the U.S. vaccinates more Americans. As of Monday, more than 140 million Americans, or 42.5% of the total population, had received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, according to data compiled by the CDC. Roughly 95.8 million Americans, or 28.9% of the population, are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. During a press briefing Tuesday, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said she hopes the new guidance will encourage more Americans to get vaccinated. "Today is another day we can take a step back to the normalcy of before," she said. "If you are fully vaccinated, things are much safer for you than those who are not fully vaccinated." Walensky declined to define a "small gathering." She said it was difficult to provide an exact number because it depends on the size of the space for gathering, the space between people and the amount of ventilation. The announcement from the CDC comes just ahead of Memorial Day and Fourth of July parade season. President Joe Biden has said he hopes to see enough Americans vaccinated by Independence Day to safely hold small outdoor gatherings. On Tuesday, Biden touted the CDC guidance, saying vaccinated people can now go to the park or a picnic with friends unmasked. He cited the loosened restrictions as a reason to get vaccinated, but stressed that Americans should still wear masks in more crowded outdoor settings. "I want to be clear: If you're in a crowd like a stadium or at a concert, you still need to wear a mask, even if you're outside," he said in a speech on North Lawn at the White House. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, told CNBC on Monday that public health officials should take a more relaxed stance on outdoor activities in general because vaccination levels in the U.S. are driving down new infections. Officials should take steps "to allow more gatherings outside, allow more large groups, allow sporting events, things of that nature," he told "Squawk Box." "The weather is warming up. We have the opportunity to bring more activities outside. We know activities outside are lower risk than things done indoors." Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto, said Monday he supported the anticipated guidance. He said that more research is showing that few Covid infections happen outdoors. He added that masks should still be mandated in indoor settings until most of the U.S. population is vaccinated and that it is difficult for the virus to spread from one person to another. The CDC also said unvaccinated people can exercise alone or with a household member without a mask. It still recommends vaccinated people wear masks in places such as hair salons, shopping malls, museums, movie theaters and houses of worship. "It's been over a year. We have a very good understanding of who gets infected and how they get infected," he told CNBC in a phone interview. "I think it's fair to say you don't need to wear a mask outside unless you can't maintain 2 meters or 6 feet of social distancing." Over the weekend, White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci indicated that the new mask guidance was imminent, but also warned that Americans should adhere to public health measures until the CDC makes an assessment. "What I believe you're going to be hearing, what the country is going to be hearing soon, is updated guidelines from the CDC," Fauci told ABC's Sunday program "This Week With George Stephanopoulos." "The CDC is a science-based organization. They don't want to make any guidelines unless they look at the data and the data backs it up."
The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines were found to be 94% effective at preventing hospitalizations among people ages 65 and over in a real-world study published Wednesday by the CDC. The two-dose mRNA vaccines were also found in the study to be 64% effective at preventing hospitalizations in the elderly who received just one shot. The U.S. agency said the findings were consistent with those found in clinical trials.	The Pfizer - BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines are 94% effective at preventing hospitalizations among fully vaccinated adults ages 65 and older, according to a real-world study published Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The two-dose mRNA vaccines were also found in the study to be 64% effective at preventing hospitalizations in the elderly who received just one shot. The study evaluated 417 hospitalized adults across 14 states from January to March. The U.S. agency said the findings were consistent with those found in clinical trials. "This multisite U.S. evaluation under real-world conditions suggests that vaccination provided protection against COVID-19–associated hospitalization among adults aged ≥65 years," the CDC wrote in the study. "Vaccination is a critical tool for reducing severe COVID-19 in groups at high risk." The CDC study provides more evidence on the benefits of getting vaccinated against the virus, which has infected more than 32.1 million Americans and killed at least 573,420, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Health officials had previously said Covid-19 hospitalizations among older Americans, who are at increased risk for severe disease, have tumbled since the shots first became available in the United States late last year. As of Tuesday, more than 81% of U.S. adults ages 65 and older have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to data compiled by the CDC. More than 67% of U.S. adults ages 65 and older are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. In a statement Wednesday, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said the agency's findings were "encouraging and welcome news." "The results are promising for our communities and hospitals," she said. "As our vaccination efforts continue to expand, COVID-19 patients will not overwhelm health care systems — leaving hospital staff, beds, and services available for people who need them for other medical conditions." Earlier this week, White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Americans should begin to see a turning point in the pandemic "within a few weeks" as the U.S. continues to vaccinate Americans at a rapid pace. The U.S. is reporting an average of 2.7 million daily Covid-19 vaccinations over the past week, according to data from the CDC, about equivalent to levels one month ago. If the U.S. continues its vaccination pace, "literally within a few weeks, we're going to start to see a turning around of the dynamics," Fauci said Monday during a virtual event hosted by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. "Not down to no infections," he said. "If you're waiting for classic measles-like herd immunity, that's going to be a while before we get there. But that doesn't mean we're not going to have a significant diminution in the number of infections per day and a significant diminution in all of the parameters, namely hospitalizations and deaths."
Seating at bars will be allowed in New York City starting May 3, more than a year after restrictions first went into place. Outdoor dining curfews of 12 a.m. are set to end by May 17, and indoor dining curfews will expire May 31. The announcements come as Covid infections decline and vaccinations increase.	New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday that the state will lift dining curfews statewide and a ban on bar seating in New York City in a major milestone for the recovery of an industry hit hard by pandemic lockdowns. Seating at bars will be allowed in New York City starting May 3, more than one year after restrictions first went into place at the height of the coronavirus pandemic . Once considered the pandemic hotspot in the country, New York City has been hit hard by shutdowns. Severe restrictions on bars and restaurants that began March of last year left the city suffering widespread unemployment, with more than 1,200 restaurants closing their doors permanently as of July 2020, according to the New York City comptroller . The governor also announced that other food and beverage service curfews in the state will end, too. Outdoor dining curfews of 12 a.m. are set to end by May 17, and indoor dining curfews will expire May 31. Curfews for all catered events will be lifted May 31 and 1 a.m. curfews for catered events where attendees have proof of vaccination status or a recent negative Covid test result will be lifted by May 17. Catered events at residences can also resume beginning May 3 above the state's residential gathering limit of 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors, as long as the events are staffed by a licensed caterer and strictly adhere to health and safety guidance, according to a press release from the governor's office. The announcements come as Covid numbers in New York state and New York City continue to decrease. The positivity rate is just over 2% statewide and just over 6% in the city. The vaccination campaign is also making progress, with 44% of New York state residents having received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. "We know the COVID positivity rate is a function of our behavior, and over the last year New Yorkers have remained disciplined and continued with the practices we know work to stop the spread of the virus," Cuomo said. "Lifting these restrictions for restaurants, bars and catering companies will allow these businesses that have been devastated by the pandemic to begin to recover as we return to a new normal in a post-pandemic world." The governor also announced that gyms and fitness centers outside of New York City will increase from 33% to 50% capacity, casinos and gaming facilities will increase from 25% to 50% capacity, and offices will increase from 50% to 75% capacity. "To be clear, we will only be able to maintain this progress if everyone gets the Covid vaccine," Cuomo said.
Dr. John Brooks, chief medical officer for the CDC's Covid-19 response, said people shouldn't hesitate to see a doctor about lingering Covid symptoms. The condition, colloquially known as "long Covid," is still not well understood. Symptoms can include chest pain, difficulty breathing and trouble thinking clearly. Older Americans, women and people who are obese appear to have a higher risk of developing long Covid.	Americans shouldn't hesitate to seek medical care if they believe they are suffering from lingering and debilitating symptoms due to Covid-19 , a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official advised Wednesday. So-called long Covid is still not well understood by health experts, Dr. John Brooks, chief medical officer for the CDC's Covid-19 response, told a House committee. A primary care physician can help determine whether one is suffering from long Covid or an unrelated illness, he said. "If you're having symptoms you haven't had before, something new following Covid [such as] chest pain, difficulty breathing, you can't get your thinking clearly, you're just not getting better the way you thought you should, have a low threshold to seek care," Brooks said during a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Generally, people worry about going to the hospital and wasting a physician's time on something that may not be too serious, especially during the pandemic, Brooks said. In cases of potential long Covid, which researchers are still trying to understand, people shouldn't do that, he said. "That may be alright for the short term until we can really discriminate more clearly what defines this. We're in the stage of learning," he said. Symptoms of long Covid, which researchers are now calling Post-Acute Sequelae of Covid-19, or PASC, can develop well after the initial infection, and severity can range from mild to incapacitating, according to public health officials and health experts. Researchers at the University of Washington published data in February that found a third of patients reported ongoing symptoms, including fatigue, shortness of breath and sleep disorders, that persisted for as long as nine months. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told the House committee Wednesday that people who have been hospitalized with the virus appear to have a higher chance of developing long Covid. But people who were not hospitalized can also end up with persistent symptoms, he said. Older Americans, women and people who are obese also appear to have a higher risk of developing long Covid, Collins told the committee, adding the U.S. agency is working quickly to identify potential other risk factors. The NIH launched an initiative in February to study long Covid and identify the causes and potential treatments. Some people who have suffered from long Covid say they are finding relief after getting vaccinated , puzzling health experts. Sheri Paulson, a 53-year-old North Dakota resident who had trouble getting out of bed months after her Covid-19 diagnosis, told CNBC in March she began to feel better five days after she got her first Pfizer shot in February Collins said Wednesday that the agency has heard anecdotal reports of people feeling better after getting vaccinated. But he added large studies are still needed to determine whether the shots are actually improving symptoms and how.
Moderna said it now has data that could support a three-month refrigerated shelf life for its vaccine. The mRNA vaccine is approved to be stored in the refrigerator between 36 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 30 days and up to seven months at minus 4 Fahrenheit. The new storage temperature could "facilitate easier distribution to doctor's offices and other smaller settings," the company said.	Moderna said Thursday its Covid-19 vaccine can remain stable at temperatures found in refrigerators for three months, citing new data. The mRNA vaccine is approved to be stored in a refrigerator between 36 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 30 days and up to seven months at minus 4 Fahrenheit. But Moderna said it now has data that could support a three-month refrigerated shelf life for the vaccine. If authorized by the Food and Drug Administration, the new storage temperature could "facilitate easier distribution to doctor's offices and other smaller settings," the company said. It also said it is working on new formulations of its vaccine that could extend the shots' refrigerated shelf life even further. Moderna's Covid vaccine is one of three authorized for use in the U.S. The vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech may be stored at refrigerated temps for up to five days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Johnson & Johnson's vaccine can be stored in a regular refrigerator for up to three months. To public officials, the authorization of J&J's shot was a blessing since it could be used in hard-to-reach places that may not have reliable refrigeration, such as tribal lands , poorer neighborhoods as well as rural and border communities. The update from Moderna comes weeks after the FDA announced that it gave the company clearance to speed up output of its Covid vaccine by letting it fill a single vial with up to 15 doses. It was previously permitted for 10 doses, enough to inoculate five people since the vaccine requires two shots given a month apart. Separately, the company announced Thursday it is increasing its minimum Covid vaccine production target for 2021 to 800 million doses, up from 700 million.
A broad majority of U.S. employers, 65%, plan to offer employees incentives to get vaccinated and 63% will require proof of vaccination, according to an ASU/Rockefeller Foundation survey. Overall, 44% will require all employees to get vaccinated, 31% will just encourage vaccinations and 14% will require some employees to get vaccinated.	More than 60% of companies in the U.S. will require proof of vaccination from their employees, according to a new survey conducted by Arizona State University with support from the Rockefeller Foundation. A broad majority of U.S. employers, 65%, plan to offer employees incentives to get vaccinated and 63% will require proof of vaccination, according to the survey. Overall, 44% will require all employees to get vaccinated, 31% will just encourage vaccinations and 14% will require some employees to get vaccinated. When it comes to consequences for failing to comply with company vaccination policy, 42% of businesses said the employee will not be allowed to return to the physical work environment, and 35% said disciplinary actions are on the table, up to and including possible termination. The survey, released Thursday, represents the responses of 957 facilities across 24 industry sectors in the U.S. Most of the respondents were businesses with 250 or more employees. Testing still remains critical to employers with 70% of respondents currently conducting Covid tests that are mostly mandatory. In terms of employee well-being, the corporate respondents said burnout increased 54% and mental health concerns overall increased 59%. However, morale and productivity also both when up by nearly 50%. Looking forward, 66% of employers are planning to allow employees to work from home full-time through 2021, and 73% intend to offer flexible work arrangements when the pandemic is over. However, 73% of businesses want employees to work from the office at least 20 hours a week. "This is not just a bubble that goes back to 'normal', there will be some positive flexibility after the pandemic ends and we go back to in-person work," said Mara G. Aspinall, a professor at Arizona State University's College of Health Solutions and one of the authors of the survey. Employees are mainly concerned about their personal health, risk of infection and safety of the workplace, according to the survey. Thirty-eight percent of employees want to return eventually but not immediately and about one quarter said they are reluctant to return at all, according to the businesses that responded to the survey. "The pandemic has changed the traditional office environment in many ways, possibly forever, yet a majority of employers are indicating they see real value in employees continuing to interact face-to-face," Nathaniel L. Wade, a co-author of the study who is also affiliated with ASU's College of Health Solutions. "We really wanted to make sure we're giving public information to help people make good decisions." Most employees, about 51%, would prefer to wait until the government or health agencies allow them to return to work, and about 47% said they would return to in-person work when the entire workforce is vaccinated. "Employers have been relatively quiet in the pandemic, we're now entering the next phase where employers are creating their own policies so that employees can go safely and sustainably back to the workplace," Aspinall said. "People want to get back to normal, but they want to do it in a safe way."
The strain, known as B.1.617, contains two key mutations that have been found separately in other coronavirus variants. The variant, also referred to as the "double mutant," was first spotted in India. The variant has since been identified in other countries, including the United States. BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said past testing of the vaccine included double mutants and he expects the shot to be effective against B.1.617. However, Sahin said the company won't know for sure until it has more data.	BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin told CNBC on Thursday he is "confident" the company's Covid-19 vaccine with U.S. partner Pfizer is effective against a coronavirus variant first identified in India. The strain, known as B.1.617, contains two key mutations that have been found separately in other coronavirus variants. The variant, also referred to as the "double mutant," was first spotted in India , where it's thought by some to be behind a recent surge in new Covid-19 cases there. The variant has since been identified in other countries, including the United States. Sahin said the German drugmaker has tested its two-dose vaccine, which is currently not available in India, against similar "double mutants." Based on those data, Sahin said he feels assured the shot will still be protective. "We are evaluating [the strain] ... and the data will be available in the coming weeks," he told CNBC. "However, we had similar double mutants in our prior testing, and we are confident based on the data we had in the past that we might see a similar fashion of neutralization of this virus. But we will only know it if we have the data in our hands," he added. In recent months, U.S. health officials have said they are concerned new, highly contagious variants of the virus might one day become skilled at evading the protection of currently authorized vaccines. They are urging Americans to get vaccinated as quickly as possible before new and potentially more dangerous variants emerge. Studies have shown the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is still protective against other strains, including B.1.526, the variant first identified in New York , and B.1.1.7, the variant found in the U.K. An Israeli study found B.1.351, the variant discovered in South Africa, was able to evade some of the protection of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, though the shot remained highly effective. Even though the shot remains effective, Sahin said people will likely need a third shot of its two-dose Covid-19 vaccine as immunity against the virus wanes, agreeing with previous comments made by Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and BioNTech chief medical officer Dr. Ozlem Tureci. In February, Pfizer and BioNTech said they were testing a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine to better understand the immune response against new variants of the virus. Sahin said Thursday that researchers are seeing a decline in antibody responses against the virus after eight months. "If we provide a boost we could really amplify the antibody response even above the levels that we had at the beginning and that could give us real comfort for protection for at least 12 months, maybe 18 months," he said.
White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said about 8% of Americans who received one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna Covid vaccines have not returned for their second shot. Skipping the second dose could cause problems for those Americans, he said, because a single shot triggers a weaker immune response than two. "If you're having a two-dose regimen, make sure you're getting that second dose," Fauci said.	White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci on Friday urged Americans to make sure they receive their second dose of the Covid-19 vaccines, saying the second shot provides "dramatic" benefits. Pfizer 's and Moderna 's Covid vaccines require two doses given three to four weeks apart. Both vaccines are about 95% effective against the virus, but that strong protection doesn't kick in until two weeks after the second dose, officials say. Fauci said Friday that about 8% of Americans who received one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna Covid vaccines have not returned for their second shot. But skipping the second dose could cause problems for those Americans, he said, because a single shot of the vaccine triggers a weaker immune response compared with two. Fauci cited numerous scientific studies, including a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report published Wednesday that found the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines are 64% effective at preventing hospitalizations in the elderly after one shot, but 94% effective after two doses. The study evaluated 417 hospitalized adults across 14 states from January to March. "If you're having a two-dose regimen, make sure you're getting that second dose," he said during a White House briefing on the coronavirus pandemic . Early on, officials and public health experts said they worried it would be difficult for some Americans, especially working-class people who cannot as easily take time off, to return for a second dose. Still, officials have said the uptake of second shots is better than expected. On Friday, Fauci also urged health-care providers to make sure they quickly reschedule canceled visits for second shots. Fauci's remarks come as the U.S. is experiencing its first true slowdown in the rate of daily vaccinations after months of a steady climb. The country is averaging 2.6 million reported vaccinations per day over the past week, CDC data shows, down from a peak of 3.4 million reported shots per day on April 13. His comments also come as the U.S. is tracking highly contagious new variants of the virus. Fauci has previously said two doses of Pfizer's or Moderna's Covid vaccines are better than one to protect against variants. Earlier this month, Fauci offered advice for those who have reported being diagnosed with Covid after receiving their first vaccine shot and before receiving their second shot. He said people who get infected with the coronavirus between Covid-19 vaccine shots can get their second dose after they've recovered from the illness and are no longer considered contagious. – CNBC's Nate Rattner contributed to this report.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Friday that indoor dining capacity in New York City will be increased to 75% on May 7. New York City gyms and fitness centers will expand to 50% capacity beginning May 15, while hair salons, nail salons, barbershops and other personal care services will expand to 75% capacity beginning May 7. Almost 6.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the city, with 30% of city residents fully vaccinated, according to the city's department of health.	New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Friday that indoor dining capacity in New York City will be increased to 75% on May 7, finally matching indoor dining capacity regulations in the rest of the state. "After a long and incredibly difficult fight, New York State is winning the war against Covid-19, and that means it's time to loosen some restrictions put in place to protect the public health and help our local businesses," the governor said. The announcement comes a day after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city would fully reopen by July 1 after more than a year of restrictions. Cuomo said he thinks the city could reopen sooner. Restaurants won't be the only businesses getting a capacity upgrade. Fitness centers and personal care services will be opening their doors to a higher flow of patrons as well. New York City gyms and fitness centers will expand to 50% capacity beginning May 15, while hair salons, nail salons, barbershops and other personal care services will expand to 75% capacity beginning May 7. The governor announced Wednesday that bar seating restrictions will be lifted on May 3. Outdoor dining curfews of 12 a.m. are set to end by May 17, and indoor dining curfews will expire May 31. Casinos and gaming facilities will increase from 25% to 50% capacity, and offices will increase from 50% to 75% capacity. "We need to reopen and rebuild our economy as the data and the science improves in our favor, and these new announcements will help New Yorkers get back on their feet after an incredibly tough year," Bronx Chamber of Commerce President Lisa Sorin said in a press release. Severe restrictions on bars and restaurants that began in March of last year left the city suffering widespread unemployment, with more than 1,200 restaurants closing their doors permanently as of July 2020, according to the New York City comptroller . The announcements come as the city records a seven-day average of 1,480 new cases. Almost 6.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the city, with 30% of city residents fully vaccinated, according to the city's department of health. Correction: This article has been updated to clarify that 30% of New York City residents have been fully vaccinated, according to the city's department of health.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order on Monday that immediately suspends the state's remaining Covid-19 public health restrictions. "I think that's the evidence-based thing to do," DeSantis said at a Monday news conference. Private businesses can still require masks and enforce social distancing and other protective measures.	WASHINGTON — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order Monday that immediately suspends all outstanding local Covid-19 emergency orders and related public health restrictions. "The fact is, we are no longer in a state of emergency," DeSantis said during a news conference. He acknowledged that Florida was still not done with its fight against the coronavirus but reiterated the nation's decline in Covid-19 cases and deaths. "I think that's the evidence-based thing to do," DeSantis said, adding that asking vaccinated individuals to continue to wear masks would undermine confidence in the coronavirus vaccines. Private businesses can still require masks and enforce social distancing and other protective measures. DeSantis signed a bill Monday that codifies the executive order into law, effective July 1. The executive order, he said, was designed to "bridge the gap" until then. The measure, which effectively ends all local pandemic-related restrictions, also bans vaccine passports. Florida has reported the third-most Covid-19 cases in the U.S. at more than 2.2 million since the beginning of the pandemic and the fourth-highest death toll at more than 35,000 fatalities, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Average new cases there, however, have fallen by more than 13% over the last week, dropping to 4,885 as of Sunday, according to the data. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Last week, the Biden administration announced a relaxation of federal public health guidance on wearing masks outdoors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that fully vaccinated people can exercise and attend small gatherings outside without wearing a face mask . The agency still recommends that fully vaccinated people wear a mask outdoors when in crowded areas.
Young children could get vaccinated by the end of the year, BioNTech co-founder and chief medical officer Dr. Ozlem Tureci told CNBC. However, that depends on how clinical trials go and whether the FDA approves it. In late March, Pfizer and BioNTech began a clinical trial testing their vaccine on healthy 6-month to 11-year-old children.	Data on how well the Pfizer - BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine works in kids ages 5 to 11 could be available as early as the end of this summer, the scientist who helped develop the shot told CNBC. If clinical trials go well and the Food and Drug Administration approves it, young children could get vaccinated by the end of the year, BioNTech o-founder and chief medical officer Dr. Ozlem Tureci said late Thursday. "We expect the data at the end of the summer or autumn of this year. We will then file it with the regulators and, depending on how fast they react, by the end of the year we might get approval to also immunize younger children," she said. In late March, Pfizer and BioNTech began a clinical trial testing their vaccine on healthy 6-month to 11-year-old children, a crucial step in obtaining federal regulatory clearance to start vaccinating young kids and controlling the pandemic. For the first phase of the trial, the companies will identify the preferred dosing level for three age groups – between 6 months and 2 years old, 2 and 5, and from ages 5 through 11. The doses will be evaluated in children ages 5 through 11 first before researchers move on to the other age groups, they said. Because the companies are evaluating the older age group first, it's possible data on kids under age 5 could come "a bit later," Tureci told CNBC. The two-dose vaccine is already authorized for use in people 16 and older. Earlier this month, Pfizer and BioNTech asked the FDA to allow their Covid-19 vaccine to be given to kids ages 12 to 15 on an emergency use basis. The companies said in late March that the vaccine was found to be 100% effective in a trial of more than 2,000 adolescents. They also said the vaccine elicited a "robust" antibody response in the children, exceeding those in an earlier trial of older teens and young adults. Side effects were generally consistent with those seen in adults, they added. Vaccinating children is seen as crucial to ending the pandemic. The nation is unlikely to achieve herd immunity — when enough people in a given community have antibodies against a specific disease — until children can get vaccinated, health officials and experts say. Children make up around 20% of the total U.S. population, according to government data. Between 70% and 85% of the U.S. population needs to be vaccinated against Covid to achieve herd immunity, experts say, and some adults may refuse to get the shots. In addition to testing the vaccine in young children, Pfizer and BioNTech are testing whether a third dose of the vaccine would provide a better immune response against new variants of the virus. BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin told CNBC on Thursday he is "confident" the vaccine is effective against B.1.617, a highly contagious coronavirus variant first identified in India. Still, he said, people will likely need a third shot of its two-dose vaccine as immunity against the virus wanes. Researchers are seeing a decline in antibody responses against the virus after eight months, he added. "If we provide a boost we could really amplify the antibody response even above the levels that we had at the beginning and that could give us real comfort for protection for at least 12 months, maybe 18 months," Sahin said. "And this is really important in a time where all the variants are coming in." Sahin also said he expects demand for the shot to continue to increase, adding the company is boosting the manufacturing capacity of the vaccine to 3 billion doses by the end of 2021. In December, Sahin expects the company's manufacturing goal will go up to 400 million doses a month.
Alan Patricof told CNBC on Monday an increase to the capital gains tax rate for wealthy Americans, proposed by President Joe Biden, would not change investor behavior. "I believe that the amount of money that will be put into start-ups will be just as strong as it is now," the longtime venture capitalist and Democratic donor said. "I think that new companies will be started. I think that funds will be formed. Private equity will prosper," he added.	Alan Patricof, a longtime tech investor and Democratic donor , told CNBC on Monday he is not concerned about the prospect of higher capital gains taxes for wealthy Americans. In an interview on "Closing Bell," the co-founder of venture capital firm Greycroft did not throw his support behind a specific rate for the capital gains tax. He also suggested the proposal recently put out by President Joe Biden will likely "be modified in some way" after negotiations in Congress, where Republicans have expressed opposition . However, Patricof said behavior is unlikely to be swayed by a capital gains tax increase, particularly as it relates to investing in young companies. Some venture capitalists, such as Tim Draper , have contended that Biden's proposal could negatively impact Silicon Valley . "I believe that the amount of money that will be put into start-ups will be just as strong as it is now,"  Patricof said. "Entrepreneurs are not going to stop and say, 'Gee whiz, the capital gains rate is going up. I better not start my company.'" "Venture capitalists like me are not all of a sudden going to turn their money back into their funds and say, 'Gee whiz, the rate is going up, so we can't justify making investments anymore," added Patricof, an early investor in Apple and AOL. Biden's recent proposal calls for raising the tax rate on long-term capital gains to 39.6% from 20% for Americans who have an annual income of more than $1 million. The 3.8% net investment income tax that's already law would effectively lift the top rate to 43.4%. Biden's American Families Plan also calls for raising the top income tax rate to 39.6% from 37%. Additionally, a White House fact sheet for the plan says that Biden "is also calling on Congress to close the carried interest loophole," which benefits managers of hedge funds, venture capital funds and private equity funds. Patricof, whose venture-capital career has stretched over 40 years , has long advocated for the elimination of the carried-interest loophole, including in a 2016 opinion article for The New York Times . Patricof told CNBC he believes narrowing the differential in tax rates on wages and capital gains was "constructive," without specifically saying whether he thought they should be placed at the same level. "I think that investors in general are going to invest their money the way they have before, and I think that new companies will be started. I think that funds will be formed. Private equity will prosper," Patricof said. "I think you've seen it in the market," he added. "I mean, the market is not collapsing because of his announced [proposed] change in rate. Everyone is expecting that the capital gains rate is going to go up. I don't think it's going to change behavior." Patricof donated thousands of dollars to Biden's 2020 presidential campaign, as well as to the Biden Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee, according to Federal Election Commission records.
The FDA is expected to authorize Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine for kids age 12 and older by next week, setting up shots before the beginning of the next school year. The announcement is set to come barely a month after the company found that its shot, which is already authorized for those age 16 and older, also provided protection for the younger group. The FDA action will be followed by a meeting of a federal vaccine advisory committee to discuss whether to recommend the shot for 12- to 15-year-olds.	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorize Pfizer 's Covid-19 vaccine for young adults age 12 and older by next week, according to a federal official and a person familiar with the process, setting up shots for many before the beginning of the next school year. The announcement is set to come barely a month after the company found that its shot, which is already authorized for those age 16 and older, also provided protection for the younger group. The federal official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to preview the FDA's action, said the agency was expected to expand its emergency use authorization for Pfizer's two-dose vaccine by early next week, and perhaps even sooner. The person familiar with the process, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, confirmed the timeline and added that it is expected that the FDA will approve Pfizer's use by even younger children sometime this fall. The FDA action will be followed by a meeting of a federal vaccine advisory committee to discuss whether to recommend the shot for 12- to 15-year-olds. Shots could begin after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adopts the committee's recommendation. Those steps could be completed in a matter of days. The New York Times first reported on the expected timing for the authorization. Pfizer in late March released preliminary results from a vaccine study of 2,260 U.S. volunteers ages 12 to 15, showing there were no cases of Covid-19 among fully vaccinated adolescents compared with 18 among those given dummy shots. Kids had side effects similar to young adults, the company said. The main side effects are pain, fever, chills and fatigue, particularly after the second dose. The study will continue to track participants for two years for more information about long-term protection and safety. Pfizer isn't the only company seeking to lower the age limit for its vaccine. Results also are expected by the middle of this year from a U.S. study of Moderna 's vaccine in 12- to 17-year-olds. But in a sign that the findings were promising, the FDA already allowed both companies to begin U.S. studies in children 11 and younger, working their way to as young as 6 months old. More than 131 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine have already been administered in the U.S., where demand for vaccines among adults has dramatically slowed in recent weeks. While younger people are at dramatically lower risk of serious side effects from Covid-19, they have made up a larger share of new virus cases as a majority of U.S. adults have been at least partially vaccinated and as higher-risk activities like indoor dining and contact sports have resumed in most of the country. Officials hope that extending vaccinations to teens will further accelerate the nation's reduced virus caseload and allow schools to reopen with minimal disruptions this fall. The U.S. has ordered at least 300 million doses of the Pfizer shot by the end of July, enough to protect 150 million people.
“India is a big country, and if there are large outbreaks there, of course we’re going to worry about more variants," said Dr. Ashish Jha. The Covid outbreak in India is putting the rest of the world at risk and is leaving a "humanitarian catastrophe" in its wake, the dean of Brown University's School of Public Health warned. Jha told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith" that because the U.S. is now at a point where it has a greater supply of vaccines than demand, that the U.S. should distribute them globally.	The Covid outbreak in India is putting the rest of the world at risk and is leaving a "humanitarian catastrophe" in its wake, the dean of Brown University's School of Public Health warned Monday. "India is a big country, and if there are large outbreaks there, of course we're going to worry about more variants, which will be bad for Indians, and ... it will spread around the world," said Dr. Ashish Jha. "So part of keeping America safe is vaccinating the whole world." The White House pledged to send more than $100 million worth of medical supplies to India as the country breaks global infection records on a near-daily basis. The country recorded more than 300,000 new cases for 12 straight days, but experts fear the real numbers could be much higher. Data shows that only about 2% of India's population is fully vaccinated against Covid. Jha told CNBC's " The News with Shepard Smith " that because the U.S. is now at a point where it has a greater supply of vaccines than demand, that the U.S. should distribute them globally. "I think we should be sharing them more widely with the world, helping them get vaccinated, that's how we'll end the pandemic globally," Jha said.
The WHO said Monday that it has categorized seven variants "of interest" and three variants "of concern" that it is following at a global level. Variants of concern, the more serious designation, include B.1.1.7, the strain first identified in the U.K. that is currently the most prevalent strain in the U.S.; B.1351, first identified in South Africa, and P.1, first identified in Brazil. "The information is coming in fast and furious," the WHO's Maria Van Kerkhove said. "There are new variants every day that are being identified and being reported, not all of which are important."	The World Health Organization is closely following 10 coronavirus variants "of interest" or "of concern" across the world, including two that were first detected in the U.S. and a triple-mutant variant that's wreaking havoc in India, as potential global public health threats. New Covid-19 strains pop up every day as the virus continues to mutate, but only a handful make WHO's official watchlist as a "variant of interest" or the more serious designation "variant of concern," which is generally defined as a mutated strain that's more contagious, more deadly and more resistant to current vaccines and treatments. The organization has classified three strains as variants of concern: B.1.1.7, which was first detected in the U.K. and is the most prevalent strain currently circulating throughout the U.S.; B.1.351, first detected in South Africa, and the P.1 variant, first detected in Brazil. One variant of interest is the B.1617 variant, or triple-mutant strain, first found in India, but the WHO's technical lead for Covid-19, Maria Van Kerkhove, said more studies are needed to completely understand its significance. "There actually are a number of virus variants that are being detected around the world, all of which we need to properly assess," Van Kerkhove said. Scientists look at how much each variant is circulating in local areas, whether the mutations change the severity or transmission of the disease and other factors before categorizing them as a new public health threat. "The information is coming in fast and furious," she said. "There are new variants every day that are being identified and being reported, not all of which are important." Other variants classified as variants of interest include B.1525, which was first detected in the U.K. and Nigeria; B.1427/B.1429, first detected in the U.S.; P.2, first detected in Brazil; P.3, first detected in Japan and the Philippines; S477N, first detected in the U.S., and B.1.616, first detected in France. Van Kerkhove said the classifications are determined, at least in part, by sequencing capacities, which vary by country. "It's really patchy so far," she said. She said the agency is also looking to local epidemiologists as an extension of the agency's "eyes and ears" to better understand the situation on the ground and identify other potentially dangerous variants. "It's important that we have the proper discussions to determine which ones are significant from a public health value, meaning does it change our ability to use public health social measures, or any of our medical countermeasures," she said. "We are putting the right people together in the room to discuss what these mutations mean," she said. "We need the global community to be working together, and they are." The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has a list of four variants of interest and five variants of concern that is similar to the WHO's list, though the CDC primarily focuses on variants that are causing new outbreaks in the United States. Van Kerkhove said a number of countries "have some worrying trends, some worrying signs of increasing case numbers, increasing hospitalization rates and ICU rates in countries that don't yet have access to the vaccine, who have not reached the coverage levels that are needed to really have that impact on severe disease and death and on transmission."
In its earnings report, Pfizer said first-quarter sales of its Covid-19 vaccine was $3.5 billion. Its quarterly earnings and revenue beat Wall Street's expectations.	Pfizer said Tuesday it plans to file for full U.S. approval of its Covid-19 vaccine with German drugmaker BioNTech at the end of this month. If the FDA signs off, the company will be able to market the shot directly to consumers. In its earnings report, Pfizer said first-quarter sales of its Covid-19 vaccine was $3.5 billion, roughly 24% of its revenue for the quarter. Its profit and revenue beat Wall Street's expectations. Here's how Pfizer did compared with what Wall Street expected, according to average estimates compiled by Refinitiv: The company now expects full-year sales of $26 billion from the vaccine, up from its previous forecast of about $15 billion. It expects an adjusted pretax profit in the high 20% range of revenue for the vaccine. Shares of Pfizer rose 1.3% in premarket trading. "Based on what we've seen, we believe that a durable demand for our Covid-19 vaccine, similar to that of the flu vaccines, is a likely outcome," Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told investors on an earnings call. Revenue from Pfizer's oncology, internal medicine, hospital and rare disease units rose by double digits during the quarter, according to the earnings report. The company's inflammation and immunology unit generated about $1 billion in sales, a 9% increase from a year earlier. Pfizer reported double-digit growth in sales for many of its cancer drugs, including Inlyta, Bosulif and Lorbrena. The company received U.S. authorization of its Covid vaccine in late December. Since then, Pfizer has distributed millions of doses to the U.S., with the goal of delivering 300 million doses by the end of July. During an earnings call, Bourla addressed a recent slow down in the pace of vaccinations in the U.S. He said it is "normal" as more people get vaccinated and the people leftover are those reluctant to get the shots. He expects an increase in vaccinations once the FDA authorizes the shots for kids ages 12 to 15, which is expected to happen this month. Usually, it takes the Food and Drug Administration nearly a year or longer to determine whether a drug is safe and effective for use in the general public. Due to the once-in-a-century pandemic, which has killed nearly 600,000 people in the United States, the FDA permitted the use of the shots under an Emergency Use Authorization. The authorization grants conditional approval based on two months of data. It's not the same as a Biologic License Application, which requires six months of data and secures full approval. The company also said it expects to apply for an EUA for a booster shot that could protect against Covid variants during the second half of July, according to a slide presentation that accompanied the company's earnings release. It expects to apply for authorization for its vaccine for use in toddlers and younger children in September and infants in November. It also expects vaccine safety data for pregnant women in late July. On April 1, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that new data from their clinical trial showed their two-dose vaccine was safe and more than 91% effective six months after the second dose. At the time, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the new data positions the companies "to submit a Biologics License Application to the U.S. FDA." If the vaccine is fully approved, it sets the stage for Pfizer and BioNTech to begin advertising the shots directly to consumers and change its pricing. It also allows the shot to stay on the market once the pandemic is over and the U.S. is no longer considered in an "emergency."
The U.S. paused use of the J&J Covid-19 vaccine for 10 days to investigate rare cases of blood clots, before recommending its use again April 23. Before the pause, more than a quarter of people who were unvaccinated said they'd choose the J&J vaccine, the only one-dose option. Now, that number has declined, but 17% still say it's their top choice.	Fewer Americans say they prefer the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine after the U.S. temporarily paused its use in April, but 17% of Americans in a new survey still say it's their top choice. That's down from 29% in March, before the pause, according to consecutive surveys of more than 1,500 Americans done for CNBC by global data and survey firm Dynata. The pause , from April 13 to 23, was recommended while U.S. regulators investigated rare but severe cases of blood clots tied to the vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended reinstating the vaccine's use after a CDC advisory group concluded the benefits of the shot outweigh its risk, while warning the clot risk is higher for women under age 50. "It's only one shot, and it's a brand name which is well-known," Mark Levine, a New York City councilmember who chairs the city's Council Committee on Health, said in an interview after the CDC advisory vote April 23. "I've certainly talked to people who have told me that they were waiting to get a vaccine until J&J came back onto the market." The Dynata survey, taken April 24-27, showed that more people said they preferred the Pfizer vaccine after the J&J pause; Pfizer as a top choice went from 20% in March to 35% in April. Moderna's vaccine went from 10% as top choice in March to 17% in April, and those who said they'd prefer either of those vaccines, which are both two doses and use the same messenger RNA technology, was relatively unchanged at 12 to 13%. Unsurprisingly, given the blood clot risk is higher for women, their preference for the J&J vaccine declined most, to 14% in April from 28% in March, compared with a decline to 21% from 29% for men. The J&J pause happened just as daily vaccinations peaked in the U.S, at more than 3 million shots administered on average per day. Monday, the U.S. recorded 1.2 million shots administered, the lowest number since February, according to Evercore ISI data. Local officials, though, told CNBC it was difficult to distinguish how much the pause affected vaccination rates, as appointments were already starting to go unfilled around the same time. "In some ways, we've gone through the people that were just so eager to get it and they wanted it, you know, yesterday," Harris County, Texas Judge Lina Hidalgo said in a telephone interview April 19. The number of Americans who say they don't plan to get a vaccine or are undecided went down slightly from March to April, the Dynata surveys found. Those who don't plan to get vaccinated declined from 13% to 12%, while those on the fence went from 6.8% to 5.6%. Asked what would make them more likely to get a vaccine, 37% said more science backing up the vaccines' safety and efficacy, while 31% said more time to feel better about long-term effects. Just 8.1% said they'd be persuaded if an employer required vaccination. Many colleges and universities have said they'll require students get vaccinated to come to campus in the fall, and Dynata's survey found just more than half of respondents age 18 to 24 agreed vaccine mandates at schools are a good idea. Just more than a quarter opposed them. --CNBC's Harriet Taylor and Whitney Ksiazek contributed to this article. The survey was conducted in collaboration with Dynata , a global data and survey firm through a first-party online panel April 24-27. The sample included 1,766 adults in the U.S. The data were weighted to correct for known demographic discrepancies. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.4% at the national level.
High-risk groups such as the elderly and people with underlying medical conditions are expected to be the first in line to get Covid vaccine booster shots, a Pfizer executive told investors Tuesday. Executives at Pfizer and BioNTech previously said people will likely need a booster shot, or third dose, within 12 months of getting fully vaccinated. They also said it's likely people will need to get additional shots each year. During an earnings call Tuesday, Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's chief scientific officer, said it makes sense to start with those most susceptible to severe illness.	High-risk groups such as the elderly and people with underlying medical conditions are expected to be the first in line to get booster shots of the Pfizer - BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, Pfizer's chief scientific officer told investors Tuesday. The two-dose vaccine has been shown to be about 95% effective against Covid two weeks after the second dose, though researchers who helped develop the shot now say they are beginning to see that strong protection wane over time. Executives at Pfizer and BioNTech previously told CNBC that people will likely need a booster shot, or third dose, of the Covid-19 vaccine within 12 months of getting fully vaccinated. They also said it's likely people will need to get additional shots each year. During an earnings call Tuesday, Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's chief scientific officer, said it makes sense to start with those most susceptible, such as older adults and those with chronic diseases that make them more vulnerable to severe illness and hospitalization, such as cardiovascular disease or asthma. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention makes recommendations to states on who should get the shots first. "We cannot predict" what the CDC will do, Dolsten said. Dolsten's comment comes after the company reported that sales of its Covid-19 vaccine boosted its first-quarter financial results. The company now expects full-year sales of $26 billion from the vaccine, up from its previous forecast of about $15 billion. It expects an adjusted pretax profit in the high 20% range of revenue for the vaccine. "Based on what we've seen, we believe that a durable demand for our Covid-19 vaccine, similar to that of the flu vaccines, is a likely outcome," Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told investors on the earnings call. Should Americans require booster shots, the U.S. government would likely need to make arrangements with the drugmakers to supply additional doses and make plans for vaccine distribution. Last month, Andy Slavitt, senior advisor to President Joe Biden 's Covid response team, said the White House is preparing for the potential need for Covid-19 vaccine booster shots. He said the Biden administration has thought about the need to secure additional doses.
Dr. Peter Hotez said Tuesday that the optics of having to incentivize the Covid vaccine do not put the U.S. in a positive light to the rest of the world. “When people are clamoring for vaccines in India and in Brazil, it just makes us look like a nation of sulky adolescents…so if it's absolutely necessary, sure, although it's tough to swallow,” Hotez said. A recent survey from UCLA showed that roughly one-third of unvaccinated people said a $100 cash payment would make them more likely to get a shot.	Dr. Peter Hotez said Tuesday that the optics of having to incentivize the Covid vaccine do not put the U.S. in a positive light to the rest of the world. "When people are clamoring for vaccines in India and in Brazil, it just makes us look like a nation of sulky adolescents. … So if it's absolutely necessary, sure, although it's tough to swallow," said Hotez, who is the dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine. A recent survey from UCLA showed that roughly one-third of unvaccinated people said a $100 cash payment would make them more likely to get a shot . The pace of vaccinations has been slipping nationwide . The U.S. is averaging about 2.3 million shots per day, which is down 32% from the peak last month, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The federal government is changing vaccine allocation strategies across the country amid the slowing pace of vaccinations. States can turn down doses that they don't need and the shots will be redistributed to areas with higher demand. Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital, told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith," that there is a risk in the new strategy. "In terms of sending away unused doses to other states, the risk of that one is, we do create this red state/blue state divide where we stop transmission in some parts of the country, but not others," said Hotez. Multiple surveys have found that Republicans are more likely to say they don't want a vaccine. Hotez explained to host Shepard Smith that in several Northeastern blue states, more than half the population has received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine and, as a result, there's been greater decreases in coronavirus infections over the last two weeks. Red states like Alabama, Tennessee, and Wyoming, however, are experiencing much smaller vaccination rates and higher infection rates than their blue-state counterparts, Hotez said.
Births fell for the sixth consecutive year to the lowest levels since 1979, the CDC said. The U.S. birth rate is so low, the nation is "below replacement levels," meaning more people die every day than are being born, the CDC said.	U.S. birth and fertility rates in 2020 dropped to another record low as births fell for the sixth consecutive year to the lowest levels since 1979, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. The number of births in the U.S. declined last year by 4% from 2019, double the average annual rate of decline of 2% since 2014, the CDC said in preliminary birth data released Wednesday. Total fertility rates and general fertility rates also declined by 4% since 2019, reaching record lows. The U.S. birth rate is so low, the nation is "below replacement levels," meaning more people die every day than are being born, the CDC said. While the agency didn't directly attribute the overall drop in births to the Covid-19 pandemic, it looked at birth rates among New York City women who delivered their babies outside the five boroughs during the height of the outbreak in the U.S. Women fled the city to give birth from March through November last year, with out-of-town births among NYC residents peaking in April and May at more than 10% for both months — a more than 70% increase from the previous year. Among white women, the percentage of out-of-town births was 2.5 times higher in 2020 than 2019. Out-of-town births among Black and Hispanic women were considerably lower and increased only for two of the months last year. Overall, the number of births declined 3% for Hispanic women and 4% for white and Black women from 2019 to 2020. Teen birth rates dropped considerably with births to 15- to-17-year olds falling by 6% and to 18- to-19-year olds falling by 7%, both hitting record lows. Birth rates among women ages 20 to 24 and 25 to 29 dipped by 6% and 4%, respectively, both to record lows. Birth rates fell by 4% and 2% respectively among women ages 30 to 34 and 35 to 39, but did not reach record lows, according to CDC data. Birth rates for women ages 40 to 44 fell by 2% from 2019, but birth rates for women 45 and up remained unchanged. according to the CDC. The data was based on population estimates derived from the 2010 census as of July 1 as well as counts of all birth records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics as of Feb. 11. The records represent nearly 100% of registered births occurring in 2020. Some experts say that a decline in birth rates could represent a lack of vital resources like housing and food among those demographics, with correlations between the rise in unemployment rates and the decline in birth rates. Still, the future economic impact of a decline in birth rates is still debated.
The rise in cases is expected as states relax pandemic prevention strategies and the B.1.1.7 variant spreads, the CDC said. While Covid cases are expected to increase this month, hospitalizations and deaths will likely remain low nationally, the U.S. agency said. The agency projected the trajectory of the pandemic based on four different scenarios of vaccination rates and state reopenings.	Covid-19 cases will likely surge again in the U.S. as the highly contagious B.1.1.7 variant takes hold across the country, peaking in May before sharply declining by July, according to new data released Wednesday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rise in Covid cases is expected as states relax pandemic prevention strategies for businesses, large-scale gatherings and schools, and the B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the U.K., spreads more rapidly throughout the country, the CDC said in the report. The agency projected the trajectory of the pandemic based on four different scenarios of vaccination rates and state reopenings. While the case numbers differed in each scenario, the general direction of the outbreak remained mostly the same in all four forecasts with cases surging in May before falling in July . While Covid cases are expected to increase this month, hospitalizations and deaths will likely remain low nationally, the U.S. agency said, with cases expected to plummet by July as more Americans get vaccinated against the virus. High vaccination coverage and compliance with pandemic safety measures "are essential to control COVID-19 and prevent surges in hospitalizations and deaths in the coming months," federal health officials wrote in the report. During a White House Covid press briefing later Wednesday, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said the projections should remind Americans "we have a path out of this." "Although we are seeing progress in terms of decreased cases, hospitalizations and death, variants are a wild card that could reverse this progress we have made," she said. "We are seeing that our current vaccines are protecting against the contaminant variants circulating in the country. Simply put, the sooner we get more and more people vaccinated, the sooner we will all get back to normal." The rate of daily new infections fell below 50,000 per day over the weekend and continues to decline, according to Johns Hopkins University data, as the latest seven-day average stands at 48,100 cases per day. The new data comes just ahead of the Memorial Day and Fourth of July holidays. President Joe Biden has said he hopes to see enough Americans vaccinated by Independence Day to safely hold small outdoor gatherings. On Tuesday, Biden announced his administration's latest goals in the fight against the coronavirus: getting 70% of U.S. adults to receive at least one dose of a Covid vaccine and having 160 million adults fully vaccinated by July 4. As of Tuesday, more than 145 million Americans age 18 and older, or 56.4% of the total adult population, have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to data compiled by the CDC. More than 105 million Americans age 18 and older, or 40.8% of the total adult population, are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. In recent weeks, the pace of individuals receiving their first vaccine doses has fallen , though U.S. health officials say they are working to improve access to the shots as well as encourage more hesitant Americans to get vaccinated. The CDC used data from the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, which developed six models to assess the potential course of Covid-19 in the U.S. across four scenarios. Researchers took into consideration vaccination rates and the implementation of policies such as mask-wearing and social distancing. Additionally, the projections were based on data through late March, when Covid cases were on the rebound. – CNBC's Nate Rattner contributed to this report.
Moderna is testing a 50-microgram dose of its vaccine in previously vaccinated individuals. It found the booster dose increased neutralizing antibody responses against the original virus as well as B.1.351 and P.1, two variants that have since spread to other countries, including the U.S.	A booster shot of Moderna 's Covid-19 vaccine generated a promising immune response against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants first identified in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, the company announced Wednesday, citing early data from an ongoing clinical trial. In the trial, Moderna is testing a 50-microgram dose of its vaccine in previously vaccinated individuals. It found the booster dose increased neutralizing antibody responses against the original virus as well as B.1.351 and P.1, two variants that have since spread to other countries, including the U.S. The company also said a booster shot of its other vaccine, which it is calling mRNA-1273.351, generated an even better immune response over its current vaccine against the B.1.351 variant from South Africa. The new vaccine is a variant-specific booster shot intended to target B.1.351. The preliminary results, which Moderna says will be published online, have not yet been peer-reviewed. "As we seek to defeat the ongoing pandemic, we remain committed to being proactive as the virus evolves," Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a press release. "We are encouraged by these new data, which reinforce our confidence that our booster strategy should be protective against these newly detected variants." Moderna said side effects were similar to those observed after the second dose of the vaccine in the previously reported studies. Side effects included pain at the injection site, fatigue and headache as well as muscle and joint pain. The new data comes as drugmakers and scientists now say people will likely need a booster shot of the Covid-19 vaccines and possibly additional shots each year, just like for the seasonal flu. Moderna's vaccine requires two doses given four weeks apart. Like Pfizer 's and Johnson & Johnson 's, the shot is highly effective against Covid, though company executives and officials now say they expect that strong protection to wane over time. Pfizer's vaccine is also a two-dose regimen while the J&J immunization is just one jab. White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci has previously said Americans may need to get booster shots to better protect against variants. Earlier Wednesday, U.S. health officials said highly contagious variants remain a "wild card" in their nationwide campaign to get most American adults vaccinated by the Fourth of July. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report published Wednesday projected Covid-19 cases would surge through May — due to the highly contagious B.1.1.7 variant first identified in the U.K. — before sharply declining by July as vaccinations drive down infections. Still, variants threaten to reverse the nation's progress, officials said, "We are seeing that our current vaccines are protecting against the contaminant variants circulating in the country. Simply put, the sooner we get more and more people vaccinated, the sooner we will all get back to normal,"  CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said during a White House Covid news briefing. Moderna is evaluating three approaches to increasing immunity. The first approach would use variant-specific booster shots, such as mRNA-1273.351, but at a lower dose than the original vaccine. The second one would combine the original vaccine with a variant-specific vaccine into a single shot at 50 micrograms or lower, Moderna said. The third would test a third shot of the original vaccine at a lower dosage. Bancel told CNBC last month that the company hopes to have a booster shot for its two-dose vaccine available in the fall.
Pfizer and Moderna shares seesawed Thursday after the Biden administration said it would support waiving patent protections for their Covid vaccines. Pfizer fell in intraday trading by as much as 5% from Wednesday's close and Moderna dipped by almost 12% before both stocks recovered most of those losses. The companies use the same mRNA technology to make their Covid vaccine shots.	Shares of two Covid vaccine makers seesawed Thursday after the Biden administration said it would back a motion before the World Trade Organization to waive patent protections of the mRNA technology used to make the vaccines. Pfizer fell Thursday by as much as 5% from Wednesday's close while Moderna dipped by almost 12% before both stocks recovered most of those losses. The companies use the same mRNA technology to make their shots. Pfizer, which is making its Covid-19 vaccine with German pharmaceutical company BioNTech, closed down by about 1% for the day, while Moderna lost about 1.4% for the day. South Africa and India are pressing U.S. officials and the WTO to temporarily waive patent protections so developing countries can produce the lifesaving vaccines until world leaders can get the pandemic under control. Human rights organizations such as Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam and Amnesty International have all signed on to a letter supporting the proposal. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai released a statement Wednesday evening backing the waiver. "This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures," she said. "The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines." Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel told investors on an earnings call Thursday he "did not lose a minute of sleep" over the news and said that trader concerns were misguided. Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca both use an adenovirus, a common type of virus that typically causes mild cold symptoms, in making their Covid vaccines. Shares of both of those companies were little changed Thursday. President Joe Biden made a campaign promise last year to "absolutely, positively" waive vaccine patents. Waiving the patent protections could take months or even years. Critics of the move say that developing countries don't have the infrastructure available to manufacture the vaccines, but others disagree. Analysts largely shrugged off the news. "We believe any new manufacturing operation could take 6 to 9 months to scale, effectively limiting the impact of other producers. Thus, while we expect pressure on MRNA from the headlines, we do not see significant practical implications from this news," analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a research note Thursday. Analysts at Bank of America cited "barriers to vaccine development including sourcing raw materials, developing manufacturing and technical know-how." They also note that "US support is not the same as approval where WTO decisions require consensus, and other members such as the EU, UK, Japan, and Switzerland currently oppose waiving IP." Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, joined those countries Thursday in opposing the waivers. "The limiting factor in vaccine manufacturing is production capacity and high quality standards, not patents," a spokeswoman for Merkel said in a statement. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen didn't embrace the waiver plan, saying in a speech she is "ready to discuss any proposals that address the crisis in an effective and pragmatic manner." Both Pfizer and Moderna already have plans in motion to produce billions of doses in the meantime, essentially leaving any competitors far behind in the manufacturing process.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can start to consider lifting indoor mask mandates now, as more and more Americans are vaccinated. “I think we should start lifting these restrictions as aggressively as we put them in,” said Gottlieb. “We need to preserve the credibility of public health officials to perhaps reimplement some of these provisions as we get into next winter, if we do start seeing outbreaks again.” "Even if vaccination rates are slowing, we're still going to continue to chip away at getting more people vaccinated...but I think that these gains are locked in, and the summer looks very good," Gottlieb said.

"We need to preserve the credibility of public health officials to perhaps reimplement some of these provisions as we get into next winter, if we do start seeing outbreaks again." The former FDA chief in the Trump administration added that he thinks "the only way to earn public credibility is to demonstrate that you're willing to relax these provisions as the situation improves." The Covid positivity rate in the U.S. is 3.6%, an all-time low according to Johns Hopkins University. It's a stark difference from April 2020, when the positivity rate hit nearly 23%, meaning nearly a quarter of all tests administered came back positive. In an interview on CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith" on Thursday evening, Gottlieb explained that the overall outlook for vaccinations in the U.S. "looks very good," especially as the FDA prepares to approve Pfizer 's Covid vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds soon . "Even if vaccination rates are slowing, we're still going to continue to chip away at getting more people vaccinated...but I think that these gains are locked in, and the summer looks very good," Gottlieb said.

The win will be seen as a barometer for the current mood in the country as it slowly reopens after strict coronavirus lockdown measures. The result will be a huge blow to Labour and its new moderate leader Keir Starmer.	LONDON — Boris Johnson's Conservative Party has convincingly won a byelection in the northern English town of Hartlepool, cementing its strong footing across working class areas of the country that once belonged to the rival Labour party. Jill Mortimer beat Labour's Paul Williams by nearly 7,000 votes, according to the count announced on Friday morning, and became the first Conservative to win the seat since the constituency was formed in 1974. By-elections happen in Britain when a seat in the House of Commons becomes vacant in between general elections. The win will be seen as a barometer for the current mood in the country as it slowly reopens after strict coronavirus lockdown measures. Johnson was heavily criticized for the initial response to the pandemic, and with over 127,000 reported fatalities, Britain has one of the worst death rates in Europe and the world. But Johnson has also been at the forefront of a successful vaccination campaign, with over 50% of the country's population now having received at least one dose of a vaccine. Political pundits have noted that the prime minister might be enjoying a "vaccine bounce," but the result in Hartlepool does underline the trend seen at the last general election in 2019. The result will be a huge blow to Labour and its new moderate leader Keir Starmer. Other elections this week for local council seats also look to be a disappointment for the opposition party. Steve Reed, a shadow communities secretary for Labour, told BBC Radio on Friday: "There's no hiding from the fact this is a shattering result for Labour."
Pfizer and BioNTech have started the regulatory process of seeking full approval for their Covid-19 vaccine for use in people 16 and older in the U.S. They are the first companies in the U.S. to file for a full license to market their shots directly to consumers. The FDA granted emergency authorization of their Covid vaccine in late December.	Pfizer and partner BioNTech said they have started the process of seeking full approval for their Covid vaccine for use in people 16 and older in the U.S., making the companies the first in the nation to file for full regulatory approval. The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorization of their Covid vaccine in late December. Since then, Pfizer has distributed 170 million doses in the U.S., with the goal of delivering 300 million doses by the end of July. "We are proud of the tremendous progress we've made since December in delivering vaccines to millions of Americans, in collaboration with the U.S. Government," Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. "We look forward to working with the FDA to complete this rolling submission and support their review, with the goal of securing full regulatory approval of the vaccine in the coming months." Shares of Pfizer were down nearly 1% in premarket trading Friday, while BioNTech's stock was down more than 1%. Covid vaccine makers' shares tanked after the Biden administration said earlier this week that it would back waiving patent protections for Covid vaccines, citing the global health crisis. Pfizer will have to demonstrate that it can reliably produce the vaccines to win full clearance. If approved, the companies could market their shots directly to consumers and possibly change the pricing of the doses. It also allows the shot to stay on the market once the pandemic is over and the U.S. is no longer considered in an "emergency." It usually takes the FDA about a year or longer to determine whether a drug is safe and effective for use in the general public. Due to the once-in-a-century pandemic, which has killed nearly 600,000 people in the United States, the FDA permitted the use of the shots under an Emergency Use Authorization. The authorization grants conditional approval based on two months of data. It's not the same as a Biologic License Application, which requires six months of data and secures full approval. The companies are seeking approval based on a "rolling submission," which expedites the review process by allowing the FDA to review new data as the company gets it. Rival Moderna said Thursday it plans to initiate a rolling submission to the FDA for its vaccine this month. "The BLA submission is an important cornerstone of achieving long-term herd immunity and containing COVID-19 in the future," Dr. Ugur Sahin, CEO and co-founder of Germany-based BioNTech, said in a statement. "We are pleased to work with U.S. regulators to seek approval of our COVID-19 vaccine based on our pivotal Phase 3 trial and follow-up data." Early data collected from 12,000 vaccinated people ages 16 and up in that phase three trial showed its shots were 91.3% effective against getting the disease at up to six months after the second dose and 95.3% effective against severe Covid as defined by the FDA, the companies said April 1. The data also demonstrated "a favorable safety and tolerability profile," they said at the time. White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN on April 28 that U.S. regulators would work "as expeditiously as possible" once the companies submit their applications for full approval. "When you're getting a formal approval you have to have a certain amount of time just observing predominantly the safety, and obviously the safety looks really, really good in well over 140 million people having been vaccinated with at least a single dose," he told CNN. "I hope they do it quickly, because .. people when they hear it's still emergency use, they still have a little concern about how far you can go with it." The companies are awaiting FDA emergency authorization to use their vaccine in kids ages 12 to 15 and said they intend to apply for a full license once they have six months of data. They said in late March that the vaccine was found to be 100% effective in a clinical trial of more than 2,000 adolescents. They also said the vaccine elicited a "robust" antibody response in the children, exceeding those in an earlier trial of older teens and young adults. Side effects were generally consistent with those seen in adults, they added.
Gary Gensler told CNBC that he sees the attraction to bitcoin for traders but regulation is needed to prevent fraud and other issues. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have boomed since late last year, fueled by increased institutional adoption for some of the more established names and increased interest from retail traders. "To the extent that something is a security, the SEC has a lot of authority. And a lot of crypto tokens — I won't call them cryptocurrencies for this moment — are indeed securities," he said.	The new head of the Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday that more investor protections are needed in the markets for bitcoin and other crypto assets. Chairman Gary Gensler said on CNBC's " Squawk Box " that he sees the attraction to bitcoin for traders but regulation is needed to prevent fraud and other issues. "It's a digital, scarce store of value, but highly volatile," Gensler said, talking about bitcoin specifically. "And there's investors that want to trade that, and trade that for its volatility, in some cases just because it is lower correlation with other markets. I think that we need greater investor protection there." Gensler later added that he believes bitcoin is a "speculative" store of value and that the SEC should be "technology neutral" when it comes to innovations in markets. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have boomed since late last year, fueled by increased institutional adoption for some of the more established coins and interest from retail traders. Bitcoin was trading above $57,000 per coin on Friday after hovering under $10,000 a year ago, while dogecoin, a digital coin that started as a joke based on a meme with a shiba inu dog, was trading near its record high. Gensler, who previously taught classes about blockchain and other financial technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said there needed to be authority for a regulator to oversee the crypto exchanges, similar to the equity and futures markets. He said many of the crypto coins were trading like assets and should fall under the purview of the SEC. "To the extent that something is a security, the SEC has a lot of authority. And a lot of crypto tokens — I won't call them cryptocurrencies for this moment — are indeed securities," he said. Gensler also commented on social media's influence on financial markets. "We need to update and freshen our rules to ensure that, while retail investors and any individual has First Amendment rights to speak and so forth, that they're not misleading the public, they're not manipulating the public, manipulating the markets," he said.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for the G-7 nations to do more to facilitate the equitable distribution of Covid vaccines worldwide. Tedros praised the U.S. decision to support temporarily waiving intellectual property protections for Covid vaccines. The proposal to waive IP protections, originally introduced by India and South Africa, faces an uphill battle at the World Trade Organization.	World Health Organization Director General-Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday urged other countries, particularly the Group of Seven industrialized nations, to follow the U.S. example and support a World Trade Organization motion to temporarily waive Covid-19 vaccine patent protections. "Wednesday's announcement by the U.S. that it will support a temporary waiver of intellectual property protections for Covid-19 vaccines is a significant statement of solidarity and support for vaccine equity," Tedros said at a press briefing. "I know that this is not a politically easy thing to do, so I very much appreciate the leadership of the U.S. and we urge other countries to follow their example." The U.S., which is a strong advocate for enforcing intellectual property rights worldwide, previously opposed waiving patent protections for Covid vaccines. President Joe Biden personally made the decision to change the U.S. stance, White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday. Biden had supported waiving Covid vaccine intellectual property rights as a presidential candidate. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America – whose members include vaccine makers AstraZeneca , Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson – strongly opposes the Biden administration's decision. WHO chief Tedros also called Friday for the G-7 industrialized nations – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.K in addition to the U.S. – to do more to facilitate the equitable distribution of Covid vaccines worldwide. "For G-7, now the most important and immediate support we need is vaccines, vaccine equity," Tedros said. "I think everybody knows what we should do to increase the production capacity and then increase vaccination coverage in all countries." According to the WHO chief, more than 80% of the more than 1 billion Covid vaccine doses distributed worldwide have gone to high-income countries, while low-income countries received 0.3%. "This kind of divide is unacceptable," Tedros said. "It's unacceptable not just because of a moral issue but it's unacceptable because we will not defeat the virus in a divided world." "It's in every country's interest in this world to share vaccines and to help in any way possible to ensure vaccine equity," the WHO chief said. "Vaccine equity is not charity. Vaccine equity is in the interest of everybody." The push to waive patent protections, proposed by India and South Africa in October of last year, faces an uphill battle at the WTO, which makes decisions through consensus among its 164 member nations. Germany, Europe's largest economy, has come out against the push to temporarily waive vaccine patents. BioNTech , which developed a Covid vaccine in partnership with Pfizer, is based in Germany. "The US proposal to remove patent protection for Covid-19 vaccines has significant implications for vaccine production as a whole," a German government spokesperson said Thursday. "The limiting factor in vaccine production is production capacity and high quality standards, not patents." The governments of Canada, Italy, Japan and the U.K. have not adopted clear public stances for or against waiving IP protections in the wake of the U.S. reversal. French President Emmanuel Macron has backed the U.S. position. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen – who heads the European Union's executive body – did not embrace the waiver plan, saying in a speech she is "ready to discuss any proposals that address the crisis in an effective and pragmatic manner." Russia, which developed the Sputnik vaccine, expressed support for the move and China is open to further discussion. The WHO announced Friday that it has approved the vaccine developed by China's Sinopharm for emergency use. About 80 countries in the WTO, largely developing nations, have expressed support for the proposal, according to The Associated Press , which cited a Geneva-based trade official. "It's also important to remember that intellectual property waivers will need to be accompanied by transfers of technology and know-how for these difficult to make vaccines," Tedros said.
China has urged United Nations member states not to attend an event planned next week by Germany, the United States and Britain on the repression of Uyghur Muslims and other minorities in Xinjiang, Reuters reports. "It is a politically-motivated event," China's U.N. mission wrote in a note. "We request your mission NOT to participate in this anti-China event." China charged that the organizers of the event, which also include several other European states along with Australia and Canada, use "human rights issues as a political tool to interfere in China's internal affairs like Xinjiang, to create division and turbulence and disrupt China's development."	China has urged United Nations member states not to attend an event planned next week by Germany, the United States and Britain on the repression of Uyghur Muslims and other minorities in Xinjiang, according to a note seen by Reuters on Friday. "It is a politically-motivated event," China's U.N. mission wrote in the note, dated Thursday. "We request your mission NOT to participate in this anti-China event." China charged that the organizers of the event, which also include several other European states along with Australia and Canada, use "human rights issues as a political tool to interfere in China's internal affairs like Xinjiang, to create division and turbulence and disrupt China's development." "They are obsessed with provoking confrontation with China," the note said, adding that "the provocative event can only lead to more confrontation." The Chinese mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ambassadors of the United States, Germany and Britain are due to address the virtual U.N. event on Wednesday, along with Human Rights Watch Executive Director Ken Roth and Amnesty International Secretary General Agnes Callamard. The aim of the event is to "discuss how the U.N. system, member states and civil society can support and advocate for the human rights of members of ethnic Turkic communities in Xinjiang," according to an invitation. Western states and rights groups have accused authorities in Xinjiang of detaining and torturing Uyghurs in camps, which the United States has described as genocide. In January, Washington banned the import of cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang over allegations of forced labor. Beijing denies the accusations and describes the camps as vocational training centers to combat religious extremism. "Beijing has been trying for years to bully governments into silence but that strategy has failed miserably, as more and states step forward to voice horror and revulsion at China's crimes against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims," Human Rights Watch U.N. director Louis Charbonneau said on Friday.
Dr. Anne Liu, an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health, told CNBC that a celebratory drink or two is totally fine. "While there aren't any studies on the effect of marijuana and Covid vaccine, it is unlikely to affect the immune response to vaccine," Katherine Yang, a clinical professor of pharmacy at the University of California San Francisco told CNBC. The general consensus among experts is that when it comes to consuming marijuana or alcohol, moderation is key.	More than half of adults in the United States have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. With second doses incoming and millions more to soon be immunized, many wonder if it is safe to celebrate their Covid shot with a booze shot. Marijuana smokers who use the plant as a pain and anxiety reliever may also turn to the herb as a treatment for side effects. Bars across the country are offering free beer if patrons provide proof of immunization, with some bars in New Jersey even offering a beer on site during inoculation. "A glass of wine or a beer is OK, but heavy alcohol intake can suppress your immune system and should be avoided in general. As always, moderation is the key," Katherine Yang, a clinical professor of pharmacy at the University of California San Francisco told CNBC. Dr. Anne Liu, an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health told CNBC that a celebratory drink or two is totally fine, and it doesn't make a difference if you drink on the day of the vaccine or a week later. "Certainly when people drink enough to affect their liver, that can affect their immune system," Liu said. "The liver is a very important organ in terms of having a normal immune response, and people who have poor liver function for various reasons may not respond well to the vaccine and in general are probably at a higher risk of complication from Covid," she said. As for marijuana, it depends on the form of consumption. Marijuana can be consumed in a variety of ways from foods, to vapor, to smoke and more. Cigarette smokers are particularly at risk for complications with Covid-19. "Smoking has specific effects on blood vessels and the cardiovascular system," Liu said. "What is not necessarily the case with other respiratory viruses and has clearly been the case with Covid is that people with disorders of blood vessels and the cardiovascular system are at much higher risk of complications with Covid, which is why smokers were high priority in some places for getting the vaccine," she said. Consuming marijuana in ways other than smoking is probably fine: "While there aren't any studies on the effect of marijuana and Covid vaccine, it is unlikely to affect the immune response to vaccine," Yang said. "It is possible, however, that marijuana or wine could make any side effects to the vaccine such as headache, nausea or achiness worse so that is something to watch out for." As for harder drugs like cocaine or ecstasy, Liu said we probably don't know enough to be able to say whether it is safe or not. "Anything in modest amounts of those substances are unlikely to significantly impair your immune system ... but it becomes much less predictable. If it's something you use recreationally, maybe just skip it that day, getting a vaccine is celebration enough," she said. The general consensus among experts is that when it comes to consuming marijuana or alcohol, moderation is key. If a person consumes these substances on a regular basis already, then pouring one out or rolling one up on the day of your vaccination, is probably fine.
White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that people may wear masks during certain seasons when respiratory illnesses are more prevalent. "We've had practically a non-existent flu season this year [...],"Fauci said. His comments come less than a month after the Biden administration announced a relaxation of federal guidance on wearing masks outdoors.	WASHINGTON — White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that people may decide to wear masks during certain seasons when respiratory illnesses are more prevalent. "I think people have gotten used to the fact that wearing masks, clearly if you look at the data it diminishes respiratory diseases, we've had practically a non-existent flu season this year merely because people were doing the kinds of public health things that were directed predominately against Covid-19," Fauci said during an interview on NBC Sunday program "Meet the Press." "So it is conceivable that as we go on a year or two or more from now that during certain seasonal periods when you have respiratory borne viruses like the flu, people might actually elect to wear masks to diminish the likelihood that you'll spread these respiratory borne diseases," he added. Fauci's comments come less than a month after the Biden administration announced a relaxation of federal public health guidance on wearing masks outdoors . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that fully vaccinated people can exercise and attend small gatherings outside without wearing a face mask . The agency still recommends that fully vaccinated people wear a mask outdoors when in crowded areas. "We are at the point right now where we can and start lifting these ordinances and allowing people to resume normal activity. Certainly, outdoors, we should not be putting limits on gatherings anymore and we should be encouraging people to go outside," Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CBS Sunday program "Face the Nation." Gottlieb added that indoor public health measures should also be relaxed in states where coronavirus infections are low and vaccination rates are high. "Covid won't disappear, we are going to have to learn to live with it but the risks have substantially reduced as a result of vaccination and as a result of immunity that people have acquired through prior infection," Gottlieb said. As of Saturday, more than 45% of the U.S. population has received at least one vaccine dose, including 33.9% who have been fully vaccinated, according to CDC data . Disclosure: Scott Gottlieb is a CNBC contributor and is a member of the boards of Pfizer, genetic testing start-up Tempus and biotech company Illumina. Pfizer has a manufacturing agreement with Gilead for remdesivir. Gottlieb also serves as co-chair of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings ′ and Royal Caribbean 's "Healthy Sail Panel."
While most people are confident in Covid vaccines, in general, just 46% of survey respondents said they were at least somewhat confident in the J&J shot That compares with 69% who said the same for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. One in 5 unvaccinated respondents said the pause on J&J's vaccine changed their mind about getting the vaccine in some way.	Less than half of Americans are confident in the safety of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine after it was temporarily halted in the U.S. following reports of a rare blood clotting issue in some recipients, according to a new survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation. While most people are confident in Covid vaccines, in general, just 46% of survey respondents said they were at least somewhat confident in the J&J shot, compared with 69% who said the same for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Kaiser surveyed 2,097 randomly selected adults ages 18 and older from April 15 through April 29 for the study published Wednesday. The Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on April 13 asked states to temporarily halt using J&J's vaccine "out of an abundance of caution" following reports of rare blood clots in six women. A CDC panel recommended the U.S. resume using the vaccine 10 days later, saying the benefits outweigh the risks. The J&J news appears to have changed some minds about getting a shot. One in 5 unvaccinated respondents said the news altered their view about getting the vaccine in some way, though the specific reactions varied, with 7% saying it made them less likely to want any of the three Covid vaccines, Kaiser found. Another 9% said it made them less likely to want the J&J vaccine but that it didn't change their minds about the Pfizer or Moderna shots. Nevertheless, the share of respondents who say they have received a shot increased significantly from last month's survey, jumping from 32% to 56%. That figure mirrors data from the CDC, which reports that about the same share of U.S. adults have received one dose or more. "The news was widespread, and it certainly affected confidence in J&J, but it's not clear that it had a big impact on whether people actually got vaccinated or not," said Dr. Mollyann Brodie, executive director of the foundation's public opinion and survey research program. "It confirmed for people who were concerned about side effects that there were side effects, but we know that the immediate effect — at least in terms of what people told us — is very minor in terms of demand." Women were more likely than men to say the J&J news changed their minds about getting vaccinated, the Kaiser survey showed, particularly Hispanic women, 18% of whom said it made them less likely to want a vaccine at all. Johnson & Johnson, in a statement to CNBC, said it was collaborating with health authorities around the world to ensure rare blood clots can be identified early and treated effectively. The timing of the Johnson & Johnson pause coincides with an overall slowdown in U.S. vaccinations. The country reported an average of 2.1 million vaccinations per day over the past week, CDC data shows, down from a peak of 3.4 million on April 13. The fact that the nationwide decline in daily shots occurred during the halt is more of a coincidence than a direct effect, said Dr. Rupali Limaye, a faculty member at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Limaye studies vaccine decision-making and has been working with state health departments during the vaccine rollout. While the pause on J&J and any resulting reluctance contributes to the decline somewhat, Limaye said the bigger factor is that the country has reached the point where most Americans who want a vaccine have gotten one. "I'm hearing from states that things are not just slowing generally because of J&J, but slowing because we've essentially been able to satisfy demand," she said. The Kaiser Foundation survey data backs this up. Respondents who said they were most eager for a shot — those already vaccinated or who want it as soon as possible — increased only slightly from the last survey in March, from 61% to 64%. The share who want to "wait and see" before getting vaccinated, which had been shrinking in size, remained about the same. "We're at a stage in the vaccination effort where all the eager folks are already vaccinated or in the process," Brodie said. "We're now turning to the people who are hesitant, with strategies needed to reach a lot of different people."
The FDA approved Pfizer and BioNTech's request to allow their Covid-19 vaccine to be given to kids ages 12 to 15 on an emergency use basis. The agency granting use of the shot in younger age groups will accelerate the nation's efforts to drive down infections, experts say. It will also allow middle school-aged students to get vaccinated before school starts this fall.	The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved Pfizer and BioNTech 's request to allow their Covid-19 vaccine to be given to kids ages 12 to 15 on an emergency use basis, allowing states to get middle school students vaccinated before the fall. The U.S. agency granting use of the shot in adolescents will also accelerate the nation's efforts to drive down infections, public health officials and infectious disease experts say. The two-dose vaccine is already authorized for use in people 16 and older. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory committee has scheduled a meeting Wednesday to review the shots for kids. If approved by the CDC as expected, it could be distributed to adolescents as soon as this week. Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said the decision brings "us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic." She assured parents that the agency "undertook a rigorous and thorough review of all available data" before clearing it for use in the teens. The companies said in late March that the vaccine was found to be 100% effective in a clinical trial of more than 2,000 adolescents. They also said the vaccine elicited a "robust" antibody response in the children, exceeding those in an earlier trial of older teens and young adults. Side effects were generally consistent with those seen in adults, they added. Vaccinating children is seen as crucial to ending the pandemic . The nation is unlikely to achieve herd immunity — when enough people in a given community have antibodies against a specific disease — until children can get vaccinated, health officials and experts say. Children make up around 20% of the total U.S. population, according to government data. Between 70% and 85% of the U.S. population needs to be vaccinated against Covid to achieve herd immunity, experts say, and some adults may refuse to get the shots. Though more experts now say herd immunity is looking increasingly unlikely as variants spread. The White House's chief medical advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said in April that the U.S. could begin vaccinating older kids against Covid-19 by the fall while elementary-age children may start getting their shots by early next year. The vaccine will be administered as a series of two doses, three weeks apart, the same regimen for 16 years of age and older, according to the FDA. Approval by the FDA for kids under age 12 could come in the second half of this year. In a slide presentation that accompanied the company's earnings release on May 4, Pfizer said it expects to apply for authorization for its vaccine for use in toddlers and young children in September and infants in November. It's already begun the submission process seeking full FDA approval for its use in people ages 16 and up, the company said Friday. In late March, Pfizer and BioNTech started a clinical trial testing their vaccine in healthy 6-month to 11-year-old children. Moderna and Johnson & Johnson , whose vaccines are authorized for people 18 and older, are also testing their shots in younger age groups. The announcement from the FDA also comes amid President Joe Biden 's push to reopen schools for in-person learning. The Biden administration has already said it would pour $10 billion into Covid testing for schools in an effort to hasten the return to in-person classes across the country. Vaccinating kids may also greenlight after-school extracurricular activities such as sports, art and other in-person activities. While parents may feel relieved their children can get vaccinated, some health experts have questioned whether doses should be held for kids, who are seen as less at risk for severe disease, while more at-risk people around the world remain unprotected. Dr. Craig Spencer, director of global health and emergency medicine at Columbia University Medical Center, said there doesn't need to be an either-or choice between vaccinating kids and distributing shots to the rest of the world. The U.S. can do both, he said. But added he is frustrated there hasn't been more focus from the U.S. on getting the rest of the world vaccinated. "If I were to ask you if a 12-year-old with no medical issues or a 57-year-old health-care worker who takes care of Covid patients every day should get vaccinated, the answer is very clear, right?" he said. "Why does that calculus change when it's a health worker from a different country?"
The FDA approved Pfizer and BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine for kids aged 12 to 15 on an emergency use basis. "This is exciting news," said NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins. "We know that a million-and-a-half adolescents have been infected with Covid-19 since this pandemic started, and not all of them have fared as well as most. And some of them have ended up with this long Covid where they're not better, even weeks or months after getting ill, so we really want to protect adolescents." More than 44% of all U.S. adults are fully vaccinated, and roughly 58% have now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, according to the CDC.	National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins described the Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorization of Pfizer and BioNTech 's Covid vaccine for kids aged 12 to 15 as "a big deal" in America's push to reopen. "This is exciting news," said Collins. "We know that a million-and-a-half adolescents have been infected with Covid-19 since this pandemic started, and not all of them have fared as well as most. And some of them have ended up with this long Covid where they're not better, even weeks or months after getting ill, so we really want to protect adolescents." The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory committee has scheduled a meeting for Wednesday to review the shots for kids. If approved by the CDC, as expected, it could be distributed to adolescents as soon as this week. More than 44% of all U.S. adults are fully vaccinated, and roughly 58% have now received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine, according to the CDC. The White House is aiming to get that number up to 70% by July 4th. Collins told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith" that the U.S. is on a "pretty good path" and that the nation should be able to see the CDC relax indoor mask regulations. "It's just finding the right way of balancing the desire not to inspire another surge, which is the last thing we need right now, with the fact that people are really sick of wearing masks," said Collins.
A WHO official said Monday it is reclassifying the highly contagious triple-mutant Covid variant spreading in India as a "variant of concern" at the global level. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead for Covid-19, said the agency will provide more details in its situation report Tuesday.	A World Health Organization official said Monday it is reclassifying the highly contagious triple-mutant Covid variant spreading in India as a "variant of concern," indicating that it's become a global health threat. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead for Covid-19, said the agency will provide more details in its weekly situation report on the pandemic Tuesday but added that the variant, known as B.1.617, has been found in preliminary studies to spread more easily than the original virus and there is some evidence it may able to evade some of the protections provided by vaccines. The shots, however, are still considered effective. "And as such we are classifying this as a variant of concern at the global level," she said during a press conference. "Even though there is increased transmissibility demonstrated by some preliminary studies, we need much more information about this virus variant in this lineage in all of the sub lineages, so we need more sequencing, targeted sequencing to be done." The WHO said last week it was closely following at least 10 coronavirus variants across the world, including the B.1.617. The variant was previously labeled a "variant of interest" as more studies were needed to completely understand its significance, Van Kerkhove said. "What it means for anybody at home is any of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating can infect you and spread and everything in that sense is of concern," she said Monday. "So, all of us at home, no matter where we live, no matter what virus is circulating, we need to make sure that we take all of the measures at hand to prevent ourselves from getting sick." A variant can be labeled as "of concern" if it has been shown to be more contagious, more deadly or more resistant to current vaccines and treatments, according to the WHO. The group issued a clarification Monday to their earlier remarks, saying that current data shows the existing Covid-19 vaccines "remain effective at preventing disease and death in people infected with this variant." The international organization has already designated three other variants with the classification: B.1.1.7, which was first detected in the U.K. and is the most prevalent variant currently circulating throughout the U.S.; B.1.351, first detected in South Africa, and the P.1 variant, first detected in Brazil. B.1.617 has three sublineages, Van Kerkhove said, that will be described in the situation report Tuesday. The variant is believed by some to be behind the latest wave of infections in India. The country is averaging about 3,879 Covid deaths per day, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, though media reports indicate the official figure is being understated. It has reported an average of about 391,000 new cases per day over the past seven days — up about 4% from a week ago, Johns Hopkins University data shows. The variant has since spread to other countries, including the United States. — CNBC's Rich Mendez contributed to this report.
The pause on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine due to rare blood-clotting cases did not disrupt the U.S. vaccine rollout, White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci told a Senate hearing Tuesday. Some people said the regulatory pause seemed to increase vaccine hesitancy in the U.S. Fauci said many people still prefer the one-shot vaccine to those from Moderna and Pfizer, which both require two doses spaced about a month apart.	The pause on Johnson & Johnson 's Covid-19 vaccine due to a rare blood-clotting problem did not disrupt the U.S. vaccine rollout, White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci told lawmakers at a Senate hearing Tuesday. U.S. health regulators urged states to stop using J&J's shots in April after six women, ages 18 to 48, developed potentially life-threatening blood clots that can lead to stroke. Some people said the regulatory pause seemed to increase vaccine hesitancy in the U.S. "I don't believe it was a setback, and if it was, we've certainly recovered from it," Fauci said at a hearing on the pandemic. A lot of people prefer the one-shot vaccine to those from Moderna and Pfizer , which both require two doses spaced about a month apart, Fauci said. He also said that the pause on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine underscored how seriously the government takes safety. "The FDA, the CDC looked at the data, they wanted to find out if there are any more. They wanted to alert the physicians who might be out there seeing patients about the proper way to treat them," Fauci said. "In the long run, in the big picture, when all was said and done, I do not believe it was a setback, I think it really underscored how seriously we all take safety," Fauci said.
Covid-19 booster shots will be free to the public if they are needed to control the ongoing pandemic, David Kessler, chief science officer of the White House Covid-19 response team, told U.S. lawmakers Tuesday. "We do have the funds to purchase the next round and to assure if there are boosters that they are free just as the last round," Kessler said at a Senate hearing.	Covid-19 booster shots will be free to the public if they are needed to control the ongoing pandemic, David Kessler, chief science officer of the White House Covid-19 response team, told U.S. lawmakers Tuesday. "We do have the funds to purchase the next round and to assure if there are boosters that they are free just as the last round," Kessler said at a Senate hearing. "Beyond 2022, I look to your guidance for at what point do you transition back to a commercial market, but I think for this coming round we are going to proceed as we have proceeded," he said. Kessler said it is still unclear if the booster shots will be necessary to protect against future variants of the coronavirus . The U.S. is making the preparations in case they are needed, he said. Antibodies that protect against the virus wane over time and new variants that reduce the effectiveness of some vaccines "all increase the probability that booster doses may be needed," he said. Kessler said the U.S. needs to speed its work in developing an oral antiviral drug that can be easily distributed to help combat the virus. The U.S. has granted emergency approval of a few drugs that use antibodies to fight Covid-19, but they have to be administered via an IV drip and haven't been widely used by health providers. "People who are immunosuppressed, who do not mount an immune response for a number of reasons or choose not to be vaccinated will continue to be vulnerable and we need options for them," Kessler said. "The antibody treatments are one approach, but a simple oral antiviral can add to our armamentarium to bring this epidemic under control." If booster shots are deemed necessary by federal health officials, seniors and people with underlying conditions would likely be the first to have access to them , as they did during the first round of vaccines. Moderna is already running tests on a potential booster shot to be administered after a patient is fully vaccinated with both previous doses of the vaccine. The Moderna booster shot already shows promising results against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants first detected in South Africa and Brazil, respectively.
“I think the CDC's credibility is eroding as quickly as the cases of coronavirus are eroding,” said Dr. Kavita Patel. "There are men and women working on the lines outside on telephone and electricity lines, and they're still wearing masks because, in the absence of this guidance, we're making it up," Patel said.	Dr. Kavita Patel is slamming the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for not effectively updating its Covid mask guidance. "I think the CDC's credibility is eroding as quickly as the cases of coronavirus are eroding," said Patel on CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith." "That's not good news, because, we do need workplace guidance, we need school guidance." "There are men and women working on the lines outside on telephone and electricity lines, and they're still wearing masks because, in the absence of this guidance, we're making it up," Patel said. "That actually puts more of us at risk, so this is time to step up. These are the hard parts of government and public health communication, but we desperately need someone to do it." Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins has said her confidence in the agency is being undermined by conflicting CDC guidance. "I used to have the utmost respect for the guidance from the CDC," Collins said during a Congressional hearing on the pandemic response Tuesday. "I always considered the CDC to be the Gold Standard. I don't anymore." The CDC did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Meanwhile, Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has said federal mask requirements were endangering the work of fishermen. "You're out on a boat. The winds are howling. Your mask is soggy wet," Murkowski said during the hearing. "Tell me how anybody thinks that this is a sane and a sound policy?" Patel, who served in the Obama Administration as director of policy for the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Engagement, echoed Murkowski's concerns.
A key CDC advisory panel is scheduled to vote Wednesday on whether to recommend the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine's use for kids ages 12 to 15. States could begin administering shots in adolescents on Thursday, pending an endorsement from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.	A key CDC advisory panel is scheduled to vote Wednesday on whether to recommend expanding usage of Pfizer 's and BioNTech 's Covid-19 vaccine to kids ages 12 to 15. The endorsement from CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which is widely expected, is the last step before U.S. officials give states the thumbs up to open vaccinations to millions of adolescents as early as Thursday. Allowing adolescents to get the shots will accelerate the nation's efforts to drive down infections and return to some form of normalcy, public health officials and infectious disease experts say. It also allows states to get middle school students vaccinated before summer camps begin and school starts in the fall. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel's meeting comes two days after the Food and Drug Administration announced it approved Pfizer and BioNTech's request to allow their vaccine to be given to young teens on an emergency use basis. The vaccine is already authorized for use in people 16 and older. It will be administered in adolescents in two doses, three weeks apart, the same regimen for 16 years of age and older, the FDA said. Here's what to expect. The meeting is scheduled to run from 11 a.m. ET to 5 p.m. ET, according to a draft of the agenda. The vote typically happens toward the end. Before the vote, medical experts will assess Pfizer and BioNTech's clinical trial data and offer their opinions on the vaccine, including whether the benefits outweigh the risks for use in adolescents. The companies said in late March that the vaccine was found to be 100% effective in a clinical trial of more than 2,000 adolescents. Side effects were generally consistent with those seen in adults, they added. Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told reporters on Monday that he expected the first shots for young teens to be administered as soon as Thursday, pending the panel's endorsement and approval from the CDC director. Vaccine distribution will vary in the U.S., officials told reporters, because states have different regulations on who can administer shots to younger age groups. The Biden administration has said it plans to send vaccines directly to pediatricians' offices and make doses available at other sites like community centers. In a statement Monday, acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock assured parents that the agency "undertook a rigorous and thorough review of all available data" before clearing it for use in younger teens. The FDA said side effects in adolescents were consistent with those reported in clinical trial participants who were 16 and older. It noted the vaccine should not be given to anyone with a known history of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. The most commonly reported side effects were pain at the injection site and in joints and muscles, tiredness, headache, chills and fever, according to the FDA. With the exception of pain at the injection site, more adolescents reported side effects after the second dose than after the first, the agency said. Side effects generally lasted one to three days. Trials are underway testing Covid vaccines in kids under age 12, but researchers expect those trials to take longer because they are gradually studying younger age groups and experimenting with lower doses after the vaccines prove to be safe in older kids. Approval by the FDA for kids under age 12 could come in the second half of this year. In a slide presentation that accompanied the company's earnings release on May 4, Pfizer said it expects to apply for authorization for its vaccine for use in toddlers and young children in September and infants in November. Moderna and Johnson & Johnson , whose vaccines are authorized for people 18 and older, are also testing their shots in younger age groups. Possibly. Schools, for example, can legally require students to get vaccinated, according to Dorit Reiss, a law professor at UC Hastings College of Law. Several colleges and universities have already said they are requiring Covid vaccinations for students returning in the fall. It is possible vaccinations will be required to participate in after-school extracurricular activities such as sports, art and other in-person activities. It's unlikely the federal government will mandate vaccines for kids or any other group, public health experts say. The CDC has already said schools can safely reopen without vaccinating teachers or students. The Biden administration has said it would pour $10 billion into Covid testing for schools in an effort to hasten the return to in-person classes across the country this fall.
Republican Gov. Mike DeWine says Ohio's mask mandate and most other coronavirus-related state orders will end on June 2. It applies to all of the state's Covid-19 orders — such as distancing in restaurants and the mask mandate — except those for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Beginning May 26, adults who have received at least one dose of the vaccine may enter a lottery that will provide a $1 million prize each Wednesday for five weeks.	Republican Gov. Mike DeWine says Ohio's mask mandate and most other coronavirus-related state orders will end on June 2, allowing three weeks for more people to get vaccinated before then. He said Wednesday that applies to all of the state's Covid-19 orders — such as distancing in restaurants and the mask mandate — except those for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. However, he noted that stores and businesses still may require customers to be masked. He also announced some big incentives for people to get vaccinated. Beginning May 26, adults who have received at least one dose of the vaccine may enter a lottery that will provide a $1 million prize each Wednesday for five weeks. On May 18, young people who have been vaccinated can register with the state for a drawing to win a full, four-year scholarship to an Ohio public university, a prize to be offered in five consecutive drawings. In announcing the news, the governor cited the sharp drop in the number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations and high vaccination rates among people 65 and older. He also said the vaccine is a "tested and proven weapon" that all Ohioans 12 and older can now avail themselves of. "It's time to end the health orders. It's been a year. You've followed the protocols," DeWine said. "You've done what we've asked. You've bravely fought this virus." "There comes a time when individual responsibility must take over," he added. In a March 4 primetime address , the governor had said he would lift remaining mandates once the state hit 50 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people for two weeks. At the time, the figure was 179 cases per 100,000 people; it had dropped to 123 cases as of this week. Despite DeWine's message, he also had little choice in removing the mandates. His speech came only a few weeks before fellow GOP lawmakers could have voted to immediately remove all mandates, per a bill passed earlier this year over the governor's veto . That legislation takes effect June 23. House Republicans signaled their intention to introduce a resolution Wednesday in preparation for a June 23 vote. "There's a strong sentiment that the health orders need to be dissolved," House Speaker Bob Cupp, a Lima Republican, said earlier Wednesday. Senate President Matt Huffman, another Lima Republican, also said Wednesday it was time for the end of mandates. "Ohioans care about getting their businesses open and doing other things that will allow some freedom," Huffman said. Also Wednesday, DeWine spokesperson Dan Tierney confirmed that employees of executive branch agencies — who have been working almost exclusively from home — would return to their offices in stages beginning July 6. DeWine implemented the current mask mandate in July as case numbers rose. That followed a mandatory mask order in April 2020 that he rescinded just a day later under intense criticism that the directive was "one government mandate too far." The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Ohio did not increase over the past two weeks, going from about 1,522 new cases per day on April 26 to 1,207 new cases per day on May 10, according to data collected by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. More than 4.2 million people in Ohio had completed the vaccination process as of Tuesday, or about 36% of the population. But the number of people seeking vaccines has dropped in recent weeks, with an average of about 16,500 starting the process last week, down from figures above 80,000 in April. In addition to his daily or weekly midday briefings, DeWine previously addressed Ohioans about the pandemic in primetime speeches Nov. 11 and July 15 . Also Wednesday, a federal judge denied Republican Attorney General Dave Yost's request for a temporary order preventing U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen from enforcing a provision of the American Rescue Plan Act that says states can't use their recovery dollars to offset tax cuts or credits. Judge Douglas Cole said Ohio has a strong chance of proving the tax rule unconstitutionally ambiguous. But the judge also found that granting the order against Yellen wouldn't provide Ohio the relief it seeks, because Treasury's rules for the money are still being worked out, the state hasn't yet received its money and Yellen has not yet tried to recoup anything.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday it recommends expanded usage of Pfizer and BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine for 12- to 15-year-old kids. The recommendation from CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky comes hours after the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices issued an endorsement, which was adopted 14-0 with one abstention.	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday signed off on expanded usage of Pfizer and BioNTech 's Covid-19 vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds, clearing the way for pediatricians to start giving out the shots across the U.S. as early as Thursday. The recommendation from CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky comes hours after the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices endorsed the change, which was adopted 14-0 with one abstention. Two days earlier, the Food and Drug Administration approved Pfizer and BioNTech's request to allow their shot to be given to young teens on an emergency use basis. President Joe Biden called the endorsement "one more giant step in our fight against the pandemic." During Wednesday's meeting, CDC officials said there were no serious adverse events associated with the Pfizer-BioNTech shot in 12- to 15-year-olds out of more than 2,000 children in the companies' clinical trial. Most vaccine recipients, 91%, experienced side effects of some kind. The most commonly reported side effects were pain at the injection site and in joints and muscles, tiredness, headache, chills and fever, Pfizer scientist Dr. John Perez told the panel. With the exception of pain at the injection site, more adolescents reported side effects after the second dose than after the first. Side effects usually resolved within one to two days, he said. The CDC panel's endorsement comes ahead of summer camp season and the Fourth of July — a date the Biden administration is hoping will mark a turning point in the nation's battle against the virus. More than 3.3 million people across the world have died from Covid-19 so far, almost 600,000 of them in the U.S., according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. After Wednesday's vote, several members expressed excitement that members of their own family could now get vaccinated. Others noted that access to the shots will help kids return to some normalcy after suffering a year of mental and social challenges due to the pandemic. "My husband and I are vaccinated. My 16-year-old is vaccinated. Now my 12- and 15-year-olds will be in line," ACIP member Helen Keipp Talbot said. The panel's recommendation will "help us close a difficult chapter for many kids & families," Andy Slavitt, the White House's top official on the nation's Covid-19 response plan, said over Twitter. Vaccinating children is seen as crucial to ending the pandemic . The nation is unlikely to achieve herd immunity — when enough people in a given community have antibodies against a specific disease — until children can get vaccinated, health officials and experts say. Children make up around 20% of the total U.S. population of 331 million, according to government data. Between 70% and 85% of the U.S. population needs to be vaccinated against Covid to achieve herd immunity, experts say, and some adults may refuse to get the shots. More experts now say, though, that herd immunity is looking increasingly unlikely as variants spread. As of Tuesday, more than 150 million Americans age 18 and older have received at least one dose, according to data compiled by the CDC. Roughly 115 million American adults are fully vaccinated, according to the agency. About 13% of adults say they definitely won't get a vaccine while 21% say they will "wait and see" or will get one only if required, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. CDC officials told the panel that research shows vaccine hesitancy among parents, with only about 46% to 60% who said they wanted to get their kids vaccinated. Reasons for not getting the shots included concerns about safety, the time it took to develop the vaccine and not having enough information, officials said. Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock on Monday assured parents that the U.S. agency "undertook a rigorous and thorough review of all available data" before clearing it for use in younger teens. CDC official Dr. Megan Wallace said Wednesday that serious adverse events were more common among vaccine than placebo participants, 0.4% versus 0.2%, but none of them were attributed to the shots. Perez said one adverse event that was associated with the vaccine was lymphadenopathy, which is a swelling of lymph nodes. In the clinical trial, there were nine cases in the vaccine group, with seven related to the shot. Two cases were in the placebo group, he said. There were no cases of anaphylaxis, according to a slide presented at the meeting. There were also no cases of Bell's palsy — a rare issue that's cropped up in some adult vaccine recipients — or blood clots, Perez said. The vaccine was found to be 100% effective in the clinical trial of 12- to 15-year-olds. No deaths were reported. More serious side effects were more common in the vaccine group, with about 11% reporting things such as pain at the injection site that prevented daily activity, severe fever, headache or muscle pain.
President Joe Biden on Wednesday urged parents to get their children vaccinated, shortly before the CDC approved the use of Pfizer and BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine for adolescents ages 12 to 15. Earlier Wednesday, a CDC advisory committee issued its recommendation, which was adopted 14-0 with one abstention. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky gave her final approval later in the day. During a press conference, Biden said the endorsement was "one more giant step in our fight against the pandemic."

CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky gave her final approval to the endorsement later in the day. During a press conference, Biden said the endorsement was "one more giant step in our fight against the pandemic." Nearly 17 million Americans are now eligible to get vaccinated, Biden said during a speech on the White House's Covid-19 response and vaccination campaign. "I encourage each of them and their parents to get their vaccination shots right away," he said. The two-dose vaccine was found to be 100% effective in the clinical trial of 12- to 15-year-olds. The most commonly reported side effects were pain at the injection site and in joints and muscles, tiredness, headache, chills and fever, Pfizer scientist Dr. John Perez told the CDC panel earlier Wednesday. Side effects usually resolved within one to two days, he said. The Biden administration is working to make the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine available in more places across the U.S., including at pediatricians' offices and local pharmacies, according to senior administration officials. The CDC has launched an effort, in partnership with states, to enroll more pediatricians and family practitioners as Covid vaccination providers to expand access to shots over the coming weeks, they said. The CDC will also partner with community health centers to make vaccinations available for teens. The CDC panel's endorsement comes ahead of summer camp season and the Fourth of July — a date the Biden administration is hoping will mark a turning point in the nation's battle against the virus.

“These issues are complex, the science is evolving, the science is moving, and we are following the science each and every day and our guidance is evolving as the science evolves,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky. The CDC chief also signaled that guidelines will be changing soon, following the agency's endorsement of the Pfizer and BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for adolescents aged 12 to 15.	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky defended the agency's Covid-19 mask guidance policies amid widespread criticism from lawmakers and health officials . "These issues are complex, the science is evolving, the science is moving, and we are following the science each and every day and our guidance is evolving as the science evolves," said Walensky during a Wednesday interview on CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith."  Walensky pointed to the nation's declining Covid cases and increasing vaccine rates. The U.S. positivity rate dropped to 3.1%, the lowest of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University .  Nearly 59% of adults have received at least one vaccine, according to the CDC . The CDC chief also signaled to host Shepard Smith that guidelines will be changing soon, following the agency's endorsement of administering Pfizer and BioNTech 's Covid-19 vaccine to adolescents aged 12 to 15. "Today we have vaccines available, now for 12 to 15-year olds, [the agency's guidelines are] going to have to evolve again, and I'm really enthusiastic about updating them very soon," Walensky said. Smith also asked Walensky why, if everyone in his office was vaccinated, they still had to wear masks indoors. She explained that the CDC wants to ensure that the vaccines are working against all of the variants circulating in the U.S., and that "you're not an asymptomatic carrier if you're vaccinated" before completely doing away with masks in indoor settings.
In its recent guidance, the CDC says, "fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask outdoors, except in certain crowded settings and venues." "We got to make that transition," Fauci said. "If you are going into a completely crowded situation where people are essentially falling all over each other, then you wear a mask." A report by The New York Times cites experts that say the CDC's data on the number of outdoor transmissions may be misleading and that it could actually be below 0.1%.	Americans need to start getting used to seeing people outside without masks as more and more people get vaccinated against Covid-19, White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Thursday. Fauci reiterated new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that says fully vaccinated people don't need to wear masks in public unless they are in a crowd. "We got to make that transition," Fauci said in an interview with CBS News after anchor Gayle King said people give her "the side-eye" when she takes her mask off outside, even though she's fully vaccinated. "If you are vaccinated and you are outside, put aside your mask, you don't have to wear it." "If you are going into a completely crowded situation where people are essentially falling all over each other, then you wear a mask," Fauci said. There is debate among medical experts over how much outdoor transmission is driving cases. "The top-line result of all studies included in the systematic review said less than 10% of cases are transmitted outdoors," CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday at a Senate hearing. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, blasted Walensky during the hearing, saying the agency's "conflicting, confusing guidance ... has undermined public confidence and contradicts the scientific guidance of many experts." A report by The New York Times cites epidemiologists that say the CDC number is misleading, and that the actual number of outdoor transmissions could be below 0.1%. Reports of new Covid-19 cases continued to decline in the U.S., averaging 36,700 new cases per day over the last week as of Wednesday, the lowest daily case average since Sept. 14, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University shows.
The CDC on Thursday announced that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a face mask under new public health recommendations. “Basically, it's acknowledging that vaccinated people can go back to normal, and can do most of the things we were doing pre-pandemic, and that is really, really terrific news,” said Dr. Ashish Jha.	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's updated masking guidelines mark a significant shift in the pandemic, the dean of Brown University's School of Public Health said Thursday. "Basically, it's acknowledging that vaccinated people can go back to normal, and can do most of the things we were doing pre-pandemic, and that is really, really terrific news," said Dr. Ashish Jha. The new CDC rules advise that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a face mask or stay 6 feet away from others in most outdoor or indoor settings. Jha told CNBC's " The News with Shepard Smith " that he thinks states should leave indoor mask mandates for another month, so that people who got their shot on April 19th would be fully vaccinated. President Joe Biden opened up Covid vaccination eligibility to all U.S. residents 18 years and older on April 19. Jha also advised unvaccinated children continue to wear a mask. "I'm going to ask my unvaccinated 9-year-old to wear a mask if we go indoors to someplace like a grocery store because I'm going to assume that there are other unvaccinated people who are maskless... We're going to have to have some kids still wearing masks for a little while," Jha said.
The CDC announced new public health recommendations on masks Thursday. There are a handful of instances where people will still need to wear masks even if they've had their final vaccine dose two or more weeks ago. Masks will still be required in health-care settings, at businesses that mandate them or on public transportation.	Fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a face mask or stay 6 feet away from others in most settings, whether outdoors or indoors, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in updated public health guidance released Thursday. There are a handful of instances where people will still need to wear masks — in a health-care setting or at a business that requires them — even if they've had their final vaccine dose two or more weeks ago, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters at a press briefing. Fully vaccinated people will also still need to wear masks on airplanes, buses, trains and other public transportation, she said. "Anyone who is fully vaccinated can participate in indoor and outdoor activities, large or small, without wearing a mask or physical distancing," Walensky said. "If you are fully vaccinated, you can start doing the things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic. We have all longed for this moment, when we can get back to some sense of normalcy." Walensky said unvaccinated people should still continue to wear masks, adding they remain at risk of mild or severe illness, death, and risk of spreading the disease to others. People with compromised immune systems should speak with their doctor before giving up their masks, she said. She added there is always a chance the CDC could change its guidance again if the Covid pandemic worsens or additional variants emerge. "This is an exciting and powerful moment, it could only happen because of the work of so many who made sure we have the rapid administration of three safe and effective vaccines," she said. The announcement from the CDC comes just ahead of the Memorial Day and Fourth of July parade season. President Joe Biden has said he hopes to see enough Americans vaccinated by Independence Day to safely hold outdoor gatherings. Last week, Biden announced his administration's latest goals in the fight against the coronavirus: getting 70% of U.S. adults to receive at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and having 160 million adults fully vaccinated by July 4. As of Wednesday, more than 151 million Americans age 18 and older, or 58.7% of the U.S. adult population, have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, according to data compiled by the CDC. Roughly 116 million American adults, or 45.1% of the U.S. adult population, are fully vaccinated, according to the agency. To reach the president's goal, the administration is working to make getting a Covid vaccine shot as simple and convenient as possible. Biden is directing thousands of local pharmacies to provide walk-in vaccinations to people without appointments, a senior administration official told reporters last week. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will also support pop-up and mobile clinics, which are aimed at individuals who may otherwise have trouble reaching vaccination sites. On Tuesday, the White House announced a new partnership with Uber and Lyft that will offer free rides to vaccination sites until July 4. The new CDC guidance Thursday marks a turning point in the pandemic and is likely to encourage more Americans, especially those still hesitant about receiving the shots, to get vaccinated, health experts say. U.S. health officials stressed that the Covid vaccines are highly effective, pointing to several studies, including one out of Israel that found the Pfizer-BioNTech shot was 97% successful in preventing symptomatic infections in fully vaccinated people. Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA's advisory panel, called the new guidance an "important step forward." "And yet another incentive to get vaccinated," he added. The guidance is "pragmatic [and] aligns with science," said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto. "It also demonstrates how mass vaccination can truly be a path toward normalcy and that the U.S. is far along on that path." He added it will be "nearly impossible" to enforce with those who aren't vaccinated and said some businesses that lift restrictions may need to impose an honor system. – CNBC's Rich Mendez contributed to this report.
The CDC said Thursday that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a face mask or stay 6 feet away from others in most settings, whether outdoors or indoors, drawing both praise and criticism. Disney said it planned to increase capacity limits at its U.S.-based theme parks, and The Wynn Las Vegas eased its own mask guidelines. Just six weeks ago, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky was warning people of "impending doom" as daily Covid-19 cases in the U.S. began to rise again. Business and health leaders said it is "nearly impossible" to police the use of face masks because there is no way to know who is vaccinated and who isn't.	Disney was quick to announce that it plans to further raise capacity limits at its U.S. theme parks a few hours after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced relaxed mask guidelines for the U.S. on Thursday. "[It's] big news for us, particularly if anybody's been in Florida in the middle of summer with a mask on," CEO Bob Chapek joked with analysts on an earnings call about two hours after the new recommendations were released. "Given the guidance that just came today from the CDC, and earlier guidance that we got from the governor of Florida, we've already started to increase our capacities," he said. The CDC now says fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a face mask or stay 6 feet away from others in most settings, whether outdoors or indoors, according to the updated guidance. It's the first time the federal government has encouraged people to stop wearing masks since the agency first called for face coverings more than a year ago. It marks a major turning point in the Covid-19 pandemic in the U.S. and brings the country one step closer to normalcy. Public health experts also said the change is likely to encourage more Americans, especially those still hesitant about receiving the shots, to get vaccinated. The agency, however, came under sharp criticism for its quick turnabout. Just six weeks ago , CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky was warning of "impending doom" as daily Covid-19 cases in the U.S. began to rise again. And many health and business leaders say the new recommendations were too ambiguous. It requires essential workers to police vaccination records and will be difficult to enforce. "Under current plans, it will be impossible to enforce in most settings," Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease physician at the University of California San Francisco, told CNBC. "Businesses, schools and event organizers may still have purview in requiring evidence of vaccination prior to inclusion in specific communities or events, but for other everyday events there will be no enforcement in the way of vaccine passports or QR codes as done in other countries." There are some instances where fully vaccinated people still need to wear masks: traveling by plane, bus or train as well as in certain places such as hospitals, nursing homes, prisons or at establishments that require them, the agency said. The CDC's guidance also isn't mandatory. States, municipalities and businesses can decide whether or not they want to follow it, increasing confusion for many business owners and employees. Some health and law experts told CNBC it would further complicate public health efforts to end the pandemic, adding it is "nearly impossible" to police the use of face masks because there is no way to know who is vaccinated and who isn't. More than half of the population still haven't gotten the shots, they said, risking more outbreaks from unmasked, unvaccinated individuals. "While we all share the desire to return to a mask-free normal, today's CDC guidance is confusing and fails to consider how it will impact essential workers who face frequent exposure to individuals who are not vaccinated and refuse to wear masks," Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, said in a statement. "Essential workers are still forced to play mask police for shoppers who are unvaccinated and refuse to follow local COVID safety measures. Are they now supposed to become the vaccination police?" Lisa LaBruno, senior executive vice president of retail operations and innovation for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, told CNBC the new guidance "creates ambiguity for retailers because it fails to fully align with state and local orders." "These conflicting positions put retailers and their employees in incredibly difficult situations. We urge state and local governments to coordinate with the CDC as additional guidance is issued on the road to normalcy," she said in a statement. Beauty store chain Ulta Beauty said it doesn't plan to change its mask and social distancing requirements in its stores, although it is actively assessing "the implications of this updated guidance for our guests and associates." It said the health and safety of its employees and customers was its top priority. "I hate to say 'It's complicated,' but it's complicated," said David French, a lobbyist for the National Retail Federation. On one hand, the CDC guidance could bring more clarity, but it also makes things more complex since businesses won't know who is or is not vaccinated — and neither will customers. Even with the milestone announcement, shoppers shouldn't expect to see immediate changes at their grocery store or local mall, said Joel Bines, global co-leader of the retail practice at consulting firm AlixPartners. He said the guidance will make little difference for retailers who do not know people's vaccination status — and above all, want to make sure their workers and customers don't get sick. "This is an extremely difficult management problem for any business that interacts with consumers on a physical level," he said. "There is no operating manual for this." Law professor Lawrence Gostin, director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law, said the new guidance could have "serious unforeseen consequences." "The public will not feel comfortable shopping, dining, or going to church or a gym if they have no idea whether the unmasked person standing next to them is vaccinated or not," Gostin said. As of Thursday, more than 154 million Americans, 46.6% of the U.S. population, have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, according to the CDC. Roughly 118 million Americans are fully vaccinated, according to the agency. The U.S. government is working to persuade more Americans to get a vaccine after the pace of shots slowed in recent weeks. Unlike some other countries, the U.S. doesn't have a system where people can prove they've been vaccinated. Even if there was one, vaccinated people are unlikely to always have their cards with them, and not everyone will have digital proof, said Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at UC Hastings College of Law. Areas with high vaccination rates can probably lift mask restrictions entirely, she added. "This is an exciting and powerful moment," Walensky, the CDC director, told reporters at a White House Covid-19 briefing Thursday after announcing the new guidance. "It could only happen because of the work of so many who made sure we have the rapid administration of three safe and effective vaccines." From an epidemiology standpoint, the CDC guidance "means we are at a place where we are at the best place in the pandemic we have ever been as a country with continued declines in infections, hospitalizations and deaths," said Chin-Hong. "The symbolic meaning is even more palpable," he added. "Masks have been the symbol of fear and political divisiveness [and] by casting them off, at least for vaccinated folks, it hopefully means that this is returning us to the life that we aspired to pre-pandemic." The Nevada Gaming Control Board, which sets the rules for casinos, immediately updated its rules, allowing The Wynn Las Vegas to ease its own mask guidelines. The company said Friday fully vaccinated guests and employees won't have to wear masks at its hotels and casinos. Gostin and others were critical of the CDC's abrupt change in policy, saying it's bowing to pressure from the public and governors to return to normal. "As a result, CDC is making momentous shifts in its guidance, lurching from over-caution to abandoning all caution," he said, adding that it could undermine public trust in the agency. "It will make the public rely less on CDC guidance if it feels the agency is being pushed around." On Friday, Walensky defended the timing of the new guidance. Over the last two weeks, daily Covid cases have declined by over a third, she said, and vaccinations are now widely available in most places across the U.S. She added the guidance is "empowering" people to make decisions about their own health, urging unvaccinated people not to take the risk of going out unmasked. If several people are in a room unmasked, the vaccinated people will be protected from getting Covid, she said. Emerging science shows that vaccinated people are protected and have a "very low risk of transmitting" Covid to other people, even with some of the variants that appear to make the vaccines less effective, she said on "CBS This Morning." — CNBC's Nadine El-Bawab, Sarah Whitten and Michael Wayland contributed to this article.

"They're tying their political allegiance to the political right, unfortunately. And we're seeing this play out in the bottom ten states in terms of vaccination coverage," said Dr. Peter Hotez Polls show that more than 40% of Republicans are not planning to get vaccinated.	Dr. Peter Hotez argued that the real reason a number of Americans are not getting vaccinated is their political ideology. "They're tying their political allegiance to the political right, unfortunately. And we're seeing this play out in the bottom ten states in terms of vaccination coverage," which is half of the coverage seen in the top ten states, said Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital. The top ten states with the highest rates of residents receiving at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose also chose President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Polls show that more than 40% of Republicans are not planning to get vaccinated. Hotez told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith" that regional flare-ups over the summer in the states with lower vaccination rates could lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ask Americans to wear masks again. The CDC relaxed mask guidelines for the U.S. on Thursday and said fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a face mask or stay 6 feet away from others in most settings, whether outdoors or indoors. The updated guidelines have drawn widespread criticism , but Hotez said that's because the new guidance arrived earlier than expected. "I was expecting this sometime in June, so it's a couple of weeks early," Hoetz explained. "I think it will be okay. But I think the stores, the businesses, the universities need a little time to catch up and have some internal discussions."
New Jersey will keep its indoor mask mandate in place, despite newly relaxed CDC guidelines for fully vaccinated people. Texas health officials told CNBC they agree with the new CDC guidelines and the state is in the process of updating its recommendations. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio praised the move as a "monumental day in the fight against Covid-19" and said the city is reviewing its guidelines.	New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Friday the state is keeping its indoor mask mandate in place, despite newly relaxed guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC updated its policy Thursday, saying it is safe for fully vaccinated Americans to ditch their masks in most settings, whether they are outside or indoors. While fully vaccinated New Jersey residents can take their masks off outdoors, Murphy said those who aren't vaccinated should continue to wear masks outdoors when in "close proximity" to others. The outbreak in New Jersey, which peaked in January at a seven-day average of more than 6,000 new cases a day, has since subsided to a daily average of around 500 cases over the past week. The announcement comes as other states decide whether to incorporate new CDC guidelines into state policy. Hawaii Gov. David Ige said his state's mask mandate will remain in effect for everyone, vaccinated or unvaccinated, despite the CDC's new recommendations. Hawaii recorded its highest seven day average of about 250 cases a day in late August; it's currently seeing less than 90 new cases a day, on average. Texas lifted its mask mandate in March, preceding the CDC's announcement by two months. Texas recorded a peak seven-day average of more than 23,000 cases in January, just two months before it lifted its mask mandate. It's recorded an average of just over 2,200 new cases a day over the last week. Texas' Department of State Health Services told CNBC that the agency agrees with the new CDC guidelines and is in the process of updating its recommendations. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state is reviewing its mask guidance with experts from neighboring states after the new CDC recommendations. The state of New York reported a peak seven day average of almost 17,000 cases in January; it's now recording just over 2,000 cases a day. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio praised the move as a "monumental day in the fight against Covid-19" and said the city is reviewing its own guidelines.
New York state will adopt the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's new mask guidance for fully vaccinated people starting Wednesday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday. Two weeks after their final Covid-19 vaccine dose, people no longer need to wear a face mask or stay 6 feet away from others in most settings, whether outdoors or indoors, Cuomo said. Cuomo first ordered all New Yorkers to wear a face covering while in public in April of last year.	New York state will adopt the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's new mask guidance for fully vaccinated people starting Wednesday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday. Two weeks after their final Covid-19 vaccine dose, people no longer need to wear a face mask or stay 6 feet away from others in most settings, whether outdoors or indoors, Cuomo said, following the CDC's updated public health guidance released Thursday. They will still need to wear a mask when traveling by plane, bus or train as well as in certain places such as at hospitals, schools or at establishments that require them, he said. Unvaccinated people and those with compromised immune systems should continue to wear masks, he said. Cuomo first ordered all New Yorkers to wear a face covering while in public in April of last year . "Let's get back to life," Cuomo said during a press conference. "If you are vaccinated, you are safe. No masks, no social distancing." More than 9.9 million adult New Yorkers have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, according to Cuomo. Roughly 8.3 million adult New Yorkers are fully vaccinated, he said. The state's positivity rate, or the total percentage of tests returning positive for Covid, is at 1.1% as of Sunday, its lowest level since Sept. 29, Cuomo said. "We are managing Covid; we haven't defeated Covid," he said. "We still have more work to do on vaccinations." Cuomo also announced the New York City Marathon, the world's biggest marathon, is returning on Nov. 7. The race will permit 33,000 runners, or 60% of capacity. Health and safety guidelines will be in place, subject to change as race day approaches, Cuomo said. "This is about rekindling the spirit of New York," Cuomo said. "You can open buses, you can open subways, you can open businesses, but we need to get the exuberance back."
President Joe Biden warned Monday that coronavirus case numbers could rise once again in U.S. states with low Covid-19 vaccination rates. For the first time since the pandemic began over a year ago, Covid-19 cases are down in all 50 states, Biden said. He said it would be a needless "tragedy" to see Covid cases rise among those who do not get vaccinated.	President Joe Biden warned Monday that coronavirus case numbers could rise once again in U.S. states with low Covid-19 vaccination rates. For the first time since the pandemic began over a year ago, Covid-19 cases are down in all 50 states, Biden announced during a White House press conference on the nation's progress fighting the virus. That progress could still be reversed, he said, especially in states where a low percentage of people have been vaccinated. "We know there will be advances and setbacks, and we know that there are many flare-ups that could occur," Biden said. "But if the unvaccinated get vaccinated, they will protect themselves and other unvaccinated people around them." He said it would be a needless "tragedy" to see Covid cases rise among those who do not get vaccinated. "I want to thank the American people who have stepped up and done their patriotic duty and gotten vaccinated," he said. Biden's comments Monday were just his latest push to get Americans vaccinated as quickly as possible. The Biden administration is pushing to get 70% of U.S. adults to receive at least one dose of a Covid vaccine and have 160 million adults fully vaccinated by July 4, a date Biden has said he hopes will mark a turning point in the pandemic. As of Monday, more than 154 million American adults, or 59.7% of U.S. adults, have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roughly 121 million American adults, or 47.1% of U.S. adults, are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. States with the highest number of doses administered per 100,000 people include New Hampshire, New Mexico, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts, according to the CDC data. Biden said getting a Covid vaccine is "easy as ever," with many vaccination sites across the U.S. offering walk-ins. On Thursday, the CDC announced in updated public health guidance that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a face mask or stay 6 feet away from others in most settings, whether outdoors or indoors. Many public health experts saw the move as another incentive from the administration to get vaccinated. Earlier Monday, the White House announced that the U.S. plans to send millions of additional Covid vaccine doses to foreign countries still being battered by the pandemic. At least 20 million doses of vaccines produced by Pfizer - BioNTech , Moderna and Johnson & Johnson will be shipped by the end of June, the White House said. That's on top of 60 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine that are also scheduled to ship by then, pending regulatory authorization in the U.S.
The global pandemic isn't over yet despite high Covid vaccination rates in some countries, the head of the World Health Organization warned. "There is a huge disconnect growing where in some countries with the highest vaccination rates, there appears to be a mindset that the pandemic is over, while others are experiencing huge waves of infections," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. "The pandemic is a long way far from over," he warned. "It will not be over anywhere until it's over everywhere."	The global pandemic isn't over yet despite high Covid vaccination rates in some countries, the head of the World Health Organization warned on Monday, days after the CDC told fully vaccinated Americans they can go without masks in most places. "There is a huge disconnect growing where in some countries with the highest vaccination rates, there appears to be a mindset that the pandemic is over, while others are experiencing huge waves of infections," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a news conference from the agency's Geneva headquarters. "The pandemic is a long way far from over," he warned. "It will not be over anywhere until it's over everywhere." Tedros' comments came four days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its public health guidance to say fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a face mask or stay 6 feet away from others in most settings, whether outdoors or indoors. It's the first time the federal government has encouraged people to stop wearing masks since the agency first called for face coverings more than a year ago. Some doctors said the new guidelines meant that "vaccinated people can go back to normal." In the United States, new Covid cases are on the decline as more Americans get vaccinated. As of Sunday, the nation is reporting about 33,200 daily new infections, based on a seven-day average of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, down 19% from a week earlier. Roughly 123 million Americans are fully vaccinated, according to data compiled by the CDC. Other countries are experiencing major outbreaks. India, for example, is reporting a seven-day average of about 328,900 cases a day as of Sunday, according to Hopkins' data. That's down 15% from a week ago but still an enormous number of cases. The country also reached a new record for fatalities, reporting a seven-day average of 4,039 deaths, according to Hopkins data. Tedros said the agency has been responding to the surge in India and other hot spots around the world. He said the WHO needs immediate funding in order to sustain its technical and operational support to all countries, especially those most impacted by the pandemic. "The current response plan is underfunded and the vast majority of that is ring-fenced by donors for specific countries or activities," he said. He also called on Covid vaccine manufacturers, including Pfizer and Moderna , to make more shots available to COVAX, which supplies doses to poorer countries. "We need doses right now and call on them to bring forward deliveries as soon as possible," he said.
U.S. approval of Pfizer or Moderna's vaccines can also have far-reaching impacts beyond the companies who submit the applications. Pfizer and BioNTech said May 7 they began the process of applying for their biologics license under expedited review. A day earlier, Moderna said in an earnings report it planned to begin the process of seeking full FDA approval sometime this month.	Pfizer and BioNTech have already started their application process for full U.S. approval of their Covid-19 vaccine. Rival Moderna is expected to submit for the same process for its shot later this month. The mRNA vaccines are currently on the U.S. market under Emergency Use Authorizations, which were granted by the Food and Drug Administration in December. Since then, more than 263 million shots have been administered, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Standard vaccine reviews generally take several months to a year or more to determine whether it is safe and effective for use in the general public. But due to the pandemic, which has killed nearly 600,000 Americans, the FDA permitted the use of the shots under an EUA. In a public health emergency, the manufacturing and approval of vaccines can be streamlined through emergency authorizations. Former Health Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency on Jan. 31, 2020. The health emergency has been renewed several times , most recently in late April. The FDA allowed the use of the shots with just two months of safety data under an EUA. It's not the same as a Biologic License Application, or a request for full approval, which requires at least six months of data. "The way that works is the companies have to submit in this case for a vaccine, a Biologics License Application, and that goes through somewhat more review, obviously than an EUA would," acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said on SiriusXM on April 30. "And there are more manufacturing controls that are standard that are looked at and so forth." Full approval will be beneficial to the companies for multiple reasons, former FDA commissioner Dr. Robert Califf told CNBC. For one, it will allow the companies' vaccines to stay on the market once the pandemic is over and the U.S. is no longer considered in an "emergency," he said. It also sets the stage for the companies to begin marketing the shots directly to consumers, he said. Companies can't promote their products under an EUA, he said. "The vaccines will still have to be administered under the supervision of a professional who's qualified," added Califf, who was the agency's commissioner under the Obama administration beginning in early 2016. "It's not like they can send the vaccines to people's homes. However, they can advertise on TV and promote their products under the watchful eye of the FDA." U.S. approval can also have far-reaching impacts beyond the companies who submit the applications, FDA advisors and health policy experts told CNBC. It could encourage more businesses, universities and other organizations to start requiring people to get the shots, they said, an already controversial move that has impacted millions of students and employees across the U.S. It may also raise confidence in the vaccines and combat vaccine hesitancy, they said. The FDA approval process is likely to take months. There are multiple decisions along the way, including negotiations with the companies about what goes on the product label and how the companies can advertise the shots, Califf said. White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN last month that U.S. regulators would work "as expeditiously as possible" once the companies submit their applications for full approval. "When you're getting a formal approval you have to have a certain amount of time just observing predominantly the safety, and obviously the safety looks really, really good in well over 140 million people having been vaccinated with at least a single dose," he said. "I hope they do it quickly, because ... people when they hear it's still emergency use, they still have a little concern about how far you can go with it." It is "highly likely" that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines will be fully approved by the FDA as early as the  second half of this year, said Lawrence Gostin, director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. The shots, he said, have already demonstrated to be safe and highly effective in millions of Americans. "If the FDA doesn't approve them, it means there is something worrying about their safety or effectiveness," he said. On April 1, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that new data from their clinical trial showed their two-dose vaccine was safe and more than 91% effective six months after the second dose. The companies said May 7 they began the process of applying for their biologics license. Moderna is also inching closer to submitting its BLA application for use in adults. The company announced on April 13 that its vaccine was more than 90% effective at protecting against the virus six months after the second dose. And on May 6 , the company said in an earnings report it planned to begin the process of seeking full FDA approval sometime this month. Once the companies submit their application, FDA scientists will painstakingly look through the clinical trial data, including for any discrepancies or safety concerns, said Dr. Paul Offit, a voting member of the agency's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. It's a lot of data, added Offit, also a physician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He previously said when Merck submitted its data from its 70,000-person rotavirus vaccine trial, the pages that were generated could have exceeded the height of the Sears Tower — a 1,450-foot skyscraper in Chicago that's now known as Willis Tower. "The FDA will go through every single one of those case files," he said. "And then they will create their own 100-page to 120-page document that they then will submit to our FDA advisory committee to read through. They want to make sure that the company has fairly and accurately displayed all those data." Dr. Archana Chatterjee, another voting member of the agency's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, said she doesn't expect rare adverse events that may pop up in the data to be a big problem for the vaccines. The FDA and CDC asked states to temporarily pause the use of another authorized vaccine, from Johnson & Johnson, in April after six women developed a blood clotting disorder. States resumed use of the vaccine 10 days later after a CDC advisory panel concluded the blood clots were very rare and the benefits of the shot outweighed its risks. Finding rare adverse events post-clinical trials are common, Chatterjee told CNBC. "Sometimes you do find out that when the vaccines are deployed and given to millions of people that very rare adverse events that are associated with the vaccine may emerge that did not occur during clinical trials, even with tens of thousands of people," she added. However, Offit said he can't think of any adverse events from a vaccine that didn't occur within six weeks of a dose. "There are 200 million doses or so shots that have been distributed so if it's going to cause a rare side effect, you would know that," he said. Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at UC Hastings College of Law, said there will likely be more vaccine mandates once the vaccines are fully approved. Employers and schools have few legal restrictions to require people to get vaccinated, she said. "Traditionally, employers and universities have the right to mandate vaccines," she said. Reiss said the emergency use authorizations of the vaccines made some groups nervous about mandating the shots, adding it raised some questions. The FDA had never granted an EUA for a vaccine for the entire population before and the standards for an EUA were seen by some as lower than for full approval, she said. "I think we'll see more vaccine mandates once we have approval," she said. Still, the rise in vaccine mandates post-approval may not be as prevalent as one might think, Reiss added. "There still will be many places that will be hesitant," she said. "And we know that some states are considering prohibiting employer mandates or prohibiting businesses from requiring vaccines as evidence, which creates its own issues." The groups that do mandate the vaccines will have to take into account people with disabilities or those who object to inoculations for religious reasons, Reiss said. "There's the Americans with Disabilities Act, which applies to both employers and universities, and includes a medical reason not to be vaccinated," she said. "The other thing is for employers, under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, if an employee has a sincere religious objection to a workplace rule, the employer has to accommodate them, unless its an undue burden." Once the vaccines are approved, the companies will likely aggressively market their shots and may change pricing, said Gostin, who is also a law professor at Georgetown Law. Pfizer and Moderna say they expect to generate billions in sales from the Covid vaccines this year. Under pandemic pricing, Pfizer has charged the U.S. about $19.50 per dose. Moderna has previously charged the U.S. about $15 per dose. The companies have indicated they will hike the price of their vaccines once the pandemic wanes. "We already see that with other vaccines such as for HPV and shingles," Gostin added. "But the vaccine wouldn't simply be bought by the consumer. Rather, it would be paid for by the consumer or through health insurance, and then administered by a doctor or nurse." Approval could also raise confidence in the vaccine and combat vaccine hesitancy, health experts say. In recent weeks, the pace of vaccinations in the U.S. has slowed as Americans who were eager to get the shots have already done so. FDA approval could convince more "reasonable people," or about 70% of the population, that the shots are safe and effective, said Offit. The remaining 30% likely can't be convinced and have to be compelled through other means like employee perks, he said. People think there is a difference in data quality between approval under emergency use authorization, but there really isn't, he said. "The only real difference is the length of follow-up for efficacy," he said.
People in rural areas are receiving the Covid-19 vaccines at a lower rate than those in urban areas, a CDC study found. The agency found a lower percentage of adults in rural counties who received at least one shot than in urban counties, at 38.9% and 45.7%, respectively. The study did not calculate coverage by race and ethnicity, the CDC said.	People in rural areas are receiving the Covid-19 vaccines at a lower rate than those in urban areas, potentially hindering the nation's progress toward ending the pandemic, according to a new study published Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC analyzed county-level vaccine administration data among American adults who received their first dose of either the Pfizer - BioNTech or Moderna Covid-19 vaccine or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine. It looked at data from 49 states and the District of Columbia through April 10. The agency found a lower percentage of residents in rural counties who received at least one shot than in urban counties, at 38.9% and 45.7%, respectively. The CDC also found people in rural areas who did receive a vaccine often had to travel farther to get it than people in urban areas. "Vaccine hesitancy in rural areas is a major barrier that public health practitioners, health care providers, and local partners need to address to achieve vaccination equity," the CDC wrote in the report. "As availability of COVID-19 vaccines expands, public health practitioners should continue collaborating with health care providers, pharmacies, employers, faith leaders, and other community partners to identify and address barriers to COVID-19 vaccination in rural areas," the agency added. The new data comes as more studies find rural residents may be more hesitant to get a vaccine. A Kaiser Family Foundation report published in April found 3-in-10 rural residents said they will either "definitely not" get vaccinated or will do so only if required. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky addressed the study before it was released Tuesday, saying the Biden administration was committed to reaching out to communities "in every corner of the United States." The U.S. is working to "make sure vaccine access is equitable regardless of whether you live in rural or urban areas," she said during a White House Covid-19 briefing. "Public health staff are working nationwide to provide trusted information via trusted messengers." Walensky said over the past weekend CDC staff attended the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama where U.S. health officials provided Covid testing and vaccinations. "We are truly making strides across the country to ensure people have access to vaccines," she said. The study Tuesday did not calculate coverage by race and ethnicity, the CDC said, because information on that was missing for 40% of the data.
More than half a million kids ages 12 to 15 have received a Covid vaccine in less than one week since the CDC cleared the Pfizer shot for that age group, the agency said Tuesday. Pfizer previously said that studies showed its vaccine is 100% effective in kids ages 12 to 15. Vaccinating adolescents will bring us closer to having 70% to 85% of the total population vaccinated, which experts say is needed to achieve herd immunity.	More than half a million 12- to 15-year-olds have received a Covid-19 vaccine so far — less than a week since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cleared it for public distribution , Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices endorsed the use of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for adolescents ages 12 to 15. Pfizer previously said that studies showed its vaccine is 100% effective in kids ages 12 to 15. "Last week FDA authorized and CDC recommended use of the Pfizer vaccine for adolescents. In less than one week, we have vaccinated more than 600,000 12- to 15-year-olds, and in total, more than 4.1 million adolescents aged 12 to 17 have been vaccinated so far. My own son was one of them," Walensky said. President Joe Biden has a goal of vaccinating 70% of adult Americans by July 4. Vaccinating adolescents will bring us closer to having 70% to 85% of the total population vaccinated, which experts say is needed to achieve herd immunity. About 80% of seniors have received at least one dose. Children make up 20% of the U.S. population. "Yesterday we had a landmark day, and the president announced more than 60% of people 18 years and older have received at least one vaccine dose," Walensky said. "We need to continue to ensure vaccination coverage is uniform across the country." Hospital admissions and deaths related to Covid-19 are down in the U.S., and the country is administering about 1.5 million shots per day, according to the CDC. There has been a downward trend in the pace of vaccinations in the U.S. since April. The U.S. is also seeing its lowest daily case numbers since June 2020. The seven-day average for deaths fell 8% from last week to about 600 fatalities a day, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. "We have truly made tremendous strides across the country to ensure people have access to vaccines, and there still is a lot more work for us to do ahead. We are more than 274 million administered," Walensky said. "If you haven't yet been vaccinated, perhaps you will consider being our reason to celebrate one more." Correction: This article was updated to correct Biden's July 4 goal. He wants 70% of all adult Americans to get vaccinated by that day.
Some employees at the Emergent BioSolutions plant in Baltimore failed to shower or change clothes,  according to a memo released Wednesday by a key House committee. It is required when working in the factory and likely played a role in ruining millions of Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 doses, the committee said. Inspections of the facility conducted last year also flagged problems with mold, poor disinfection of plant equipment and inadequate training of employees.	Some employees at the Emergent BioSolutions plant in Baltimore failed to shower or change clothes, which is required when working in the factory and it likely played a role in ruining millions of Johnson & Johnson 's Covid-19 doses, according to a memo released Wednesday by a key House committee. Inspections of the Bayview facility conducted last year also flagged problems with mold, poor disinfection of plant equipment and inadequate training of employees, staff for the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis said in the memo. The committee is holding a hearing Wednesday examining the biopharmaceutical company's role in ruining the J&J shots. Even though inspectors found poor conditions at the plant, top executives were awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses last year and were praised by the company's board for their leadership, according to other documents released by the committee. Emergent CEO Robert Kramer received a $1.2 million bonus last year, according to one document, while three other executives received payments of more than $400,000. The U.S. government awarded the company a $628 million contract last year to help make coronavirus vaccines. Emergent did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. The hearing Wednesday comes more than a month after the Biden administration put J&J in charge of the Baltimore plant after U.S. officials learned that Emergent, a federal contractor that had been making key ingredients for J&J and AstraZeneca , cross-contaminated ingredients for the two shots. During the hearing, Kramer said the FDA is holding over 100 million J&J Covid-19 vaccine doses for further testing. "There are a significant number of doses that we've manufactured. Again, we manufacture the bulk drug substances," Kramer told lawmakers. "It has been reported in a number of news agencies that there are probably over 100 million doses of the J&J vaccine that we've manufactured that are now being evaluated by the FDA for potential release and availability." An inspection by the Food and Drug Administration later found the plant was unsanitary and unsuitable to manufacture the shots. In a 13-page report , inspectors wrote that the facility used to manufacture the vaccine was "not maintained in a clean and sanitary condition" and was "not of suitable size, design, and location to facilitate cleaning, maintenance, and proper operations." FDA inspectors said paint was observed to be peeling in multiple areas and walls were damaged that could impact Emergent's "ability to adequately clean and disinfect." They also noted that employees did not follow standard operating procedures in handling waste or vaccine manufacturing materials to ensure they weren't contaminated. The facility has not been authorized by the FDA to manufacture or distribute Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine, and none of the doses manufactured at the plant have been distributed for use in the United States. Emergent has agreed to pause production of materials until the issues the FDA identified are resolved. Emergent said at the time it was committed to working with the FDA and J&J to fix the problems. "While we are never satisfied to see shortcomings in our manufacturing facilities or process, they are correctable and we will take swift action to remedy them," it said in a statement on April 21.
CDC officials told lawmakers Wednesday that the agency expects data on vaccines in pregnant women this summer. Principal Deputy Director Dr. Anne Schuchat said pregnant women should have access to the vaccines because they can get sicker from Covid than other people. Covid can complicate pregnancies by leading to more time spent in the ICU and more risk of severe outcomes, including rare deaths.	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said Wednesday they are expecting data from trials testing Covid-19 vaccines on pregnant women this summer and on children as young as 6 months old by the end of the year. Principal Deputy Director Dr. Anne Schuchat told lawmakers that the CDC has already received "reassuring data" on vaccines given to women in their third trimester. "We'll be expecting this summer to have even more data, particularly about vaccines given earlier in pregnancy," she said at a Senate hearing on the agency's annual budget. Although the vaccines haven't been cleared for use in pregnant women yet, Schuchat said pregnant women should have access to the vaccines because they can get sicker from Covid than other people. "Women who are pregnant and get Covid have worse experiences with the infection than do non-pregnant women," Schuchat said. "More time in the intensive care unit, more risk of severe outcomes including those rare deaths. Covid also complicates pregnancy by increasing the risk of prematurity and leading to other types of complications." Schuchat also said new data shows vaccinated mothers can transfer their Covid antibodies to their babies while breastfeeding. Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to the White House, separately Wednesday said that "the baby would get, during the pregnancy period through the placenta, antibodies against the virus" that last a few months after birth, he said. Fauci, speaking in an interview with Axios, also said mothers can transfer their Covid antibodies while breastfeeding, thereby extending their babies' immunity. Children under 12 "would likely be able to get vaccinated by the time we reach the end of calendar year 2021, and at the latest into the first quarter of 2022," he said. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told lawmakers that "vaccines are coming for youth, they're doing dose de-escalation studies now down to 9 years old, soon thereafter down to 6, then down to 3, then down to 6 months ... hoping to have more by late fall and end of the year."
The FDA is holding more than 100 million Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine doses for further testing, Emergent BioSolutions CEO Robert Kramer told lawmakers Wednesday. The agency found multiple safety violations at a plant — run by Emergent — that was helping make the shots.	The FDA is holding more than 100 million Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine doses for further testing after the agency found multiple safety violations at a plant — run by Emergent BioSolutions — that was helping make the shots, Emergent CEO Robert Kramer told lawmakers Wednesday. The U.S. put J&J in charge of the Baltimore plant last month after learning that Emergent, a federal contractor that had been making key ingredients for J&J and AstraZeneca , cross-contaminated the two shots. Kramer is testifying before House lawmakers Wednesday about poor conditions at the plant said to be responsible for ruining millions of J&J Covid-19 shots. During the hearing before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., asked Kramer how many doses of the J&J vaccine are being held by the Food and Drug Administration but weren't contaminated. "There are a significant number of doses that we've manufactured. Again, we manufacture the bulk drug substances," Kramer told the lawmaker. "It has been reported in a number of news agencies that there are probably over 100 million doses of the J&J vaccine that we've manufactured that are now being evaluated by the FDA for potential release and availability." Kramer later indicated that the regulator requested additional testing on the doses. "The FDA is evaluating, to my understanding, the doses that had been manufactured for bulk drug substances, most of which has been provided to J&J," Kramer said. "As far as I understand, there had been a request for some additional testing on all of those lots and doses that had been provided by J&J to the FDA. And it's under their evaluation right now." J&J declined to comment on the number of doses. In a statement, an FDA spokesperson said, "We are working closely with the companies for whom products were manufactured in order to come to resolution on the disposition of the products." At the hearing, Kramer expressed disappointment that conditions at the plant led to doses being ruined and manufacturing suspended. An inspection by the FDA found the plant was unsanitary and unsuitable to manufacture the shots. In a 13-page report , inspectors wrote that the facility used to manufacture the vaccine was "not maintained in a clean and sanitary condition" and was "not of suitable size, design, and location to facilitate cleaning, maintenance, and proper operations."

Dr. Anthony Fauci said Covid-19 infections are decreasing in every U.S. state. The chief medical advisor to the White House, in an interview with Axios, suggested that the widespread declines will make it safer for Americans to resume activities such as indoor dining at restaurants.	Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to the White House, said Wednesday that Covid-19 infections are decreasing in every state in the U.S. "All 50 states have now shown decreases in the number of infections," Fauci said in an interview with Axios, suggesting that the widespread declines will make it safer for Americans to resume activities such as indoor dining at restaurants. The U.S. is reporting an average of about 31,200 new cases per day over the past week , data compiled by Johns Hopkins University shows, down 18% from a week ago. Case counts have been on a downward trend since the country's most recent high point about a month ago in mid-April, when the country was seeing more than 71,000 cases per day. Fauci did not specify over what time period these state-level declines in infections have occurred. A CNBC analysis of Johns Hopkins data shows that average daily case counts have declined by 5% or more in 40 states over the past week. The data is murky in some places, such as Alabama, which Johns Hopkins says has been publishing backlogged case counts in recent days, making the most recent trend difficult to interpret. Fauci's statement suggests that the easing of the outbreak is being seen broadly across the country, rather than being more localized with a certain state or region responsible for the declining numbers.
U.S. diplomats in Cuba reported hearing strange sounds, steady pulses of pressure in their heads, and a number of other bizarre physical sensations in 2016. Frank Figliuzzi, formerly of the FBI, suggested the federal government centralize a task force under a “very senior official” in order to get to the bottom of the soundwave attacks. “Our men and women deserve better than essentially the sound of silence when we're talking about sonic attacks on them,” Figliuzzi said.	The men and women in the U.S. diplomatic corps deserve more transparency when it comes to paralyzing sonic frequency attacks, said Frank Figliuzz, the former assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI. "Our men and women deserve better than essentially the sound of silence when we're talking about sonic attacks on them," Figliuzzi said. Diplomats in Cuba reported hearing strange sounds, steady pulses of pressure in their heads, and a number of other bizarre physical sensations in 2016. They suffered lasting side-effects from a mysterious soundwave attack dubbed "Havana Syndrome." In some cases, diplomats noticed a sharp deterioration in their hearing and vision. Figliuzzi, an NBC News national security analyst, suggested that the federal government centralize a task force under a "very senior official," like the director of national intelligence, in order to get to the bottom of the soundwave attacks. The attacks were not limited to foreign diplomats and happened in the U.S., including at least twice near the White House . Figliuzzi told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith" that he doesn't think it's possible that the U.S. intel community has no idea who's behind the attacks. "I believe there's evidence that indicates that the Russian intelligence services are likely the most reasonable guess of who's doing this," Figliuzzi said. "We need to confront that, we need to be transparent about it." The Russian embassy wasn't immediately available for comment.
The Treasury Department announced that it will require any transfer worth $10,000 or more to be reported to the IRS. "Cryptocurrency already poses a significant detection problem by facilitating illegal activity broadly including tax evasion," the Treasury said. Investors have seen the value of bitcoin slide about 25% over the past month and talk of capitulation creep into online forums.	The Treasury Department on Thursday announced that it is taking steps to crack down on cryptocurrency markets and transactions, and said it will require any transfer worth $10,000 or more to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service. "Cryptocurrency already poses a significant detection problem by facilitating illegal activity broadly including tax evasion," the Treasury Department said in a release . "This is why the President's proposal includes additional resources for the IRS to address the growth of cryptoassets," the department added. "Within the context of the new financial account reporting regime, cryptocurrencies and cryptoasset exchange accounts and payment service accounts that accept cryptocurrencies would be covered. Further, as with cash transactions, businesses that receive cryptoassets with a fair market value of more than $10,000 would also be reported on." Bitcoin reversed course shortly after the Treasury's announcement and was last seen trading up 1.6%, according to Coin Metrics . Previously in the session, it was up more than 9%. A growing number of Wall Street analysts have over the past month sounded the alarm that regulators at the Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission could soon take a more active role in cryptocurrency regulation. The Treasury Department's release came as part of a broader announcement on the Biden administration's efforts to crack down on tax evasion and promote better compliance. Among proposals officials are considering are bolstered IRS funding and technology, and more severe penalties for those who evade their obligations. According to the Treasury's estimates, the difference between taxes owed to the U.S. government and those actually paid totaled nearly $600 billion in 2019. Increased regulation will likely upset some cryptocurrency investors, who have seen the value of bitcoin slide about 25% over the past month and talk of capitulation creep into online forums. With longtime cryptocurrency expert Gary Gensler at the head of the SEC, Raymond James expects it's only a matter of time until Congress grants the regulator broader jurisdiction. He told lawmakers earlier this month that allowing the SEC to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges will help ensure investors are protected and prevent market manipulation. "Chairman Gensler is viewed as a potential ally for cryptocurrencies as a former professor on the topic; however, these statements are likely to revisit debates regarding the regulatory risk to cryptocurrencies and exchanges," Raymond James analyst Ed Mills wrote earlier in May. "In the short-term, this could cause headline risk," he added. "However, in the medium-to-long term, regulation would add further legitimacy to the asset class and could provide a regulatory moat around existing cryptocurrency exchanges." While involvement by the Treasury Department and the SEC may ultimately prove a boon for cryptocurrency investors, any near-term regulatory hurdles will likely come as another bother for investors in bitcoin, dogecoin and the like. Those sentiments were echoed by Miller Tabak last month, when the firm told clients that "cryptocurrency markets are not properly considering legal risk." "Confirmation of Gary Gensler as SEC Chairman, and cryptocurrency volatility over the weekend following rumors of tighter regulation, highlight the regulatory risks facing this industry," strategic economist Paul Shea wrote in April. "The difference in regulatory risk and progress as a means of payment raises an important question: are other coins' recent success due to good news about them or are they piggybacking on positive sentiment related to bitcoin?" he added. Democrats and Republicans alike have made cryptocurrency regulation a top priority in 2021 as run-ups in the price of bitcoin and other digital assets last year sparked concerns of market manipulation and uninformed retail investments. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.
Dr. Anthony Fauci said that it’s conceivable for middle schools and high schools to be completely mask-free in the fall. Fauci told host Shepard Smith that he believes the U.S. will reach President Joe Biden's goal of having 70% of U.S. adults receive at least one dose of a Covid vaccine by July 4. "We may, at some time, have to get a booster shot, but we don't know when that is, whether that's a year or more than a year. So I think we just better be prepared for it, and that was the point that I was trying to make," Fauci said.	Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to the White House, said that it's conceivable for middle schools and high schools to be completely mask-free in the fall. "If the children get vaccinated, it is conceivable that that would actually wind up being a recommendation. We'll just have to wait and see," said Fauci. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday that more than half a million 12- to 15-year-olds have received a Covid-19 vaccine so far — less than a week since the CDC cleared it for public distribution . Fauci told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith" that he predicts the rules on vaccinated students will vary across school districts in different states because the local authorities are the ones with the power to do so. This week, the governors of Iowa and Texas signed laws banning school districts from mandating masks for students or staff. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said it was up to parents to decide whether their children should wear masks in public schools throughout the state. Fauci told host Shepard Smith that he believes the U.S. will reach President Joe Biden's goal of having 70% of U.S. adults receive at least one dose of a Covid vaccine by July 4. In turn, Fauci said that it would be unlikely for the country to experience a Covid-19 surge in the fall if people continue to get vaccinated. "It's within our power. We can stop it or prevent it merely by vaccination, and I guess that's the thing that's so frustrating about when people don't want to get vaccinated," Fauci said. "We all want to be back to normal...There's an easy pathway to that, and that is just get vaccinated." The Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases also clarified that, at this time, "we don't know" if "we absolutely will need booster shots" because we don't know the durability of protection when it comes to the vaccines. "We may, at some time, have to get a booster shot, but we don't know when that is, whether that's a year or more than a year. So I think we just better be prepared for it, and that was the point that I was trying to make," Fauci said.
The Treasury Department announced on Friday that it's given out more than $6 billion to help renters and landlords struggling in the pandemic. All together, Congress has allocated more than $45 billion to clear up the enormous arrears racked up by renters after a year of historic unemployment. Even as the public health crisis fades, more than 1 in 7 adult renters in the U.S. still say they're behind.	The Treasury Department announced on Friday that it's disbursed more than $6 billion to states to help renters and landlords struggling because of the coronavirus pandemic . Between the last two major stimulus packages, Congress has allocated more than $45 billion in rental assistance. States now have access to more than $30 billion of that money, and the rest is supposed to be available over the next few months. With the national eviction ban set to expire in weeks, housing advocates say it's vital the funds are given out quickly.

Among Black renters, that share increases to 1 in 5. "Treasury is committed to providing direct, rapid support to those impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and addressing the deep disparities in our housing systems that threaten our economic recovery," Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo said in a statement. More than 360 programs across the country are giving out the federal rental assistance. The National Low Income Housing Coalition has a list of them on their website. Programs are supposed to prioritize low-income renters and the unemployed , and people can get up to 18 months of assistance. The aid typically goes to the property owner, although organizations can give the money directly to renters if their landlords refuse to cooperate, as some are doing .
The CDC abruptly reversed its mask guidance for vaccinated Americans last week to say that vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask indoors or outdoors in most settings. States across the U.S. took the news as a cue to ease mask mandates. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott used the new guidance to justify signing an executive order that threatens to fine local officials and municipalities that don't drop mask requirements.	The CDC's new mask guidelines could actually increase the risk of spreading Covid-19 in public spaces and workplaces, scientists of a leading infectious disease group said Thursday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention abruptly reversed its mask guidance for vaccinated Americans last week to say that vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask indoors or outdoors in most settings. Officials said they changed their guidance, in part, because research shows the vaccines provide a very high level of protection against getting sick from Covid-19 and spreading it to others. "There is no debate about this fact," Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, who sits on the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said at a press briefing hosted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on Thursday. The agency's announcement, however, led to widespread confusion and frustration because "it was unexpected and lacked needed context for implementation by state and local public health community," he said. Duchin is the society's liaison to the CDC's immunization committee. The society represents leading infectious disease specialists in the U.S. "There was no information on how to apply the guidance in practice, particularly related to the inability to verify vaccination status," Duchin said. The CDC also didn't provide any guidance on whether people should continue wearing masks in areas of high transmission or low vaccination rates, he said. "What the CDC did though was sub-optimal and allowed for misimpression that the mask mandates have been lifted." Physicians across the country and federal health officials continue to emphasize that only vaccinated people are safe to remove their masks. The new mask guidance has been misinterpreted as an end to the pandemic and mask mandates, putting local health officials in a very tough position. States across the U.S. took the news as a cue to ease mask mandates. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott used the new guidance to justify signing an executive order that threatens to fine local officials and municipalities that don't drop mask requirements. Duchin said both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are probably safe outdoors without masks, but that's not the case inside. "Now the risk of Covid-19 spread is increased in crowded indoor spaces with unvaccinated people and especially with poor ventilation," Duchin said. While the CDC's scientific basis for the change "is solid," Duchin said ending the indoor mask mandate "could lead to increased risk in public spaces and workplaces with preventable Covid-19 spread primarily among the unvaccinated." Vaccination rates vary across the country, and the majority of those vaccinated are older adults. Large subgroups, such as younger adults, remain unvaccinated. Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, who also spoke at the briefing, said research has shown that up to 3% of Americans were told by their physicians that they have some level of immunodeficiency, which places them at an increased risk of exposure to Covid. "Millions of people fit this bill, and we have literally very little data on whether the vaccine works in them," Marrazzo said. "It's a real reason to be cautious and interpret the guidelines carefully." The scientists also said that people need to acknowledge that there is uncertainty about the future course of the pandemic, the impact of emerging variants, how long immunity lasts and the potential for resurgence of Covid-19. "The Covid-19 outbreak is not by any means over, there's still significant uncertainty and there's still significant disease activity," Duchin said. If someone is fully vaccinated and has no other conditions that compromise their community, and if the rates of Covid are relatively low where they live and the vaccination coverage is high, Marrazzo said, it "would be 100% fine pretty much going anywhere without a mask." Marrazzo added that because vaccination rates are not even at 50% in her community, she will continue to wear a mask indoors, despite being fully vaccinated. "If I knew that we were seeing really remarkable declines in hospitalization and symptomatic illness that was related possibly to Covid, and had a very high immunization rate, then I would probably be fine going without a mask, but I don't see that happening anytime real soon," she said. While almost half of all people in the U.S., 160.2 million, have received at least one shot, Marrazzo said only 4.6% of the world's population has done the same. "People need to pay attention about what's going on and pay attention to vaccination rates, pay attention to the involvement of these new variants and think about being prepared to sort of ramp things back up again," Marrazzo warned.

The White House announced that it is partnering with popular dating apps like Tinder, OKCupid, Plenty of Fish and more to raise vaccine awareness among young adults. Some 42% of adults ages 18 to 34 say they are not willing to get a Covid vaccine, according to a February Quinnipiac poll. According to OkCupid, users who are open about being vaccinated or planning to get vaccinated are 14% more likely to match with another user than people who don't plan to get vaccinated.	Along with asking about your perfect day or favorite vacation spot, popular dating apps like Tinder, Hinge, Bumble and Plenty of Fish will be asking members about sharing whether they've been vaccinated against Covid-19. The White House announced Friday that it is partnering with the apps to raise vaccine awareness among young adults and encourage them to get immunized. White House senior Covid official Andy Slavitt said one of the apps, OkCupid, says members who display their vaccination status "are 14% more likely to get a match. We have finally found the one thing that makes all of us more attractive, a vaccination." More than 60% of U.S. adults have received at least one dose, but 42% of adults ages 18 to 34 say they are not willing to get vaccinated, according to a February Quinnipiac poll . Young adults ages 20 to 49 were responsible for 70% of the spread Covid last year, according to a study published in the journal Science. Doctors also report seeing more young adults admitted to hospitals with severe symptoms due to the spread of more dangerous variants. Slavitt revealed last week that his son, who is 19, suffers from "long-Covid," a term used to describe those who continue to experience symptoms long after initial infection. Slavitt said his son still experiences shortness of breath and frequent flu-like symptoms six months after initial infection. Researchers say long-Covid has been observed in many young adults who experienced mild symptoms initially. With more variants emerging, summer weather approaching and mask mandates diminishing, efforts to reach hesitant young adults are intensifying. "The pandemic has also had a negative impact on young peoples' social lives. Social distancing and dating were always a bit of a challenging combination," Slavitt told reporters. As part of President Joe Biden's goal of having 70% of U.S. adults vaccinated with at least one shot by the Fourth of July, Slavitt announced that dating apps Tinder, Plenty of Fish, OkCupid, BLK, Hinge, Match, Chispa, Bumble and Badoo will begin rolling out features to encourage vaccinations among users. The apps serve more than 50 million people combined in the U.S. and many are young adults. The apps will begin displaying badges that a user can display on their profile to note that they've been vaccinated or are planning to be vaccinated. Other features include access to premium content like "boosts," "super likes" and "super swipes" for vaccinated people, and search filters so that users can specifically seek others who have been vaccinated or plan to be vaccinated. OkCupid said its features will be implemented on Monday; Chispa and BLK said theirs will be implemented on June 1. The other apps will begin to roll out the new features in the next few weeks. "In all seriousness, people are interested in other things in life besides their vaccine. But the vaccine enables people to get back to the things they enjoy in life," Slavitt said, noting that people want to know that they can resume their normal lives in a safe way.
The state administered just 63,000 vaccines in the last 24 hours, with a seven-day average of about 133,000 vaccines administered in the past week as of May 24. The current seven-day average is a small increase from last week's but a sharp drop from the state's peak when it reported a seven-day average of about 266,000 vaccinations on April 4. About 49% of the U.S. population has had at least one shot with 39% fully vaccinated, according to CDC data.	New York's Covid-19 vaccination rate has declined dramatically in recent days, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday as he pleaded with residents to get immunized against the disease that's claimed more than 590,000 lives in America. The state administered just 63,000 vaccines in the last 24 hours, with a seven-day average of about 133,000 shots administered in the past week as of May 24, according to state data. The current seven-day average is a small increase from last week's but a sharp drop from the state's peak when it reported a seven-day average of about 266,000 vaccinations on April 4. Cuomo urged New Yorkers to take vaccines seriously, saying the coronavirus pandemic is still a cause for caution. "It's not over, it's managed, but it's not over," Cuomo said at a press briefing. "The number of vaccinations is dropping off dramatically, we're now doing fewer than 100,000 per day — that's a dramatic decline, 55% decline in how many vaccines we're doing." Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the U.S. is reporting an average of 1.8 million vaccinations per day over the past week. About 49% of the U.S. population has had at least one shot with 39% fully vaccinated. The nationwide seven-day average for reported administered vaccines is currently 1.7 million, down from a peak seven-day immunization average of 3.4 million reported on April 13. The slowing immunization rate has public officials like Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio offering different perks to convince reluctant people to get their vaccine shots. They've previously offered free Yankees tickets, "vax & scratch" lottery tickets, free subway and railroad rides, and tickets to popular attractions like zoos and gardens and more. State parks will now be offering free passes with access to any of New York's 16 state parks to anyone who gets the vaccine this week at a state park vaccination site, a campaign Cuomo dubbed "a shot in the park." Cuomo said he's targeting the "youthful and the doubtful" with the latest round of incentives. "Enjoy the park, come get a vaccine, we're going to set up a vaccine site at everyone of the 16 state parks," he said. Maryland, Ohio and Oregon have set up vaccine lotteries to increase declining vaccination rates. In Ohio, where vaccination rates were falling, the number of people 16 and older getting the shots jumped 28% the weekend after the state announced its vaccine lottery program. Ohio also announced that it would give five full college scholarships to randomly chosen vaccinated students. New Jersey is offering anyone who gets their Covid shot in May a free beer at several local breweries as part of Gov. Phil Murphy's "shot and a beer" campaign. Private businesses across the U.S. have also offered incentives to vaccinated patrons like gift cards, free snacks, marijuana, beer and even free tickets to Six Flags in Illinois . -- CNBC's Nate Rattner contributed to this report.
Evidence that Covid-19 originally leaked from a Wuhan virology lab is growing, Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC on Monday. With other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, researchers were able to identify the animal those diseases emerged from at this point in those outbreaks. Global health officials will meet soon to further investigate the origins of the virus.	Evidence that Covid-19 originally leaked from a Wuhan, China, virology lab is growing, Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC on Monday, pointing to reports that three researchers from the lab sought hospital care with a Covid-like illness in November 2019. "People a year ago who said this probably came from nature, it's really unlikely it came from a lab, maybe a year ago that kind of a statement made a lot of sense because that was the more likely scenario," Gottlieb, a former head of the Food and Drug Administration, said on " Squawk Box ." "But we haven't found the true source of this virus." Scientists still haven't discovered definitive proof that the virus came from an animal, he said. With other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, researchers were able to identify the animal those diseases emerged from at this point in those outbreaks. "It's not for lack of trying, there has been an exhaustive search," Gottlieb said. A previously undisclosed U.S. intelligence report found that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology sought hospital care after falling ill "with symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illness," The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday , quoting from the report. Gottlieb said the growing number of reports provide an increasing amount of circumstantial evidence supporting the theory that the virus could have escaped from a lab. "The question for a lot of people is going to be when are too many coincidences too much, when does it seem that there's too many things suggesting that this could have come out of a lab," he said. Gottlieb said it's unlikely we'll ever know for sure. Unless there is a whistleblower or regime change in China, he said any evidence supporting the lab leak hypothesis won't likely surface. The World Health Organization has repeatedly said the virus most likely came from an animal host. But last week, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky acknowledged that it could have originated in a lab as "one possibility." Most coronaviruses, however, "generally come from an animal origin," Walensky said in Senate testimony after saying she had not seen enough data to give her opinion on how the current pandemic originated. Global health officials will meet soon to further investigate the origins of the virus.
Atlantic Council senior fellow Jamie Metzl organized last year a group of scientists and academics to call for a deeper investigation into Covid's origins. He told host Shepard Smith that it's "critically important" to find answers about the pandemic's origins because if we don't, it puts everyone "unnecessarily at risk."	The U.S. should be playing a larger role in getting to the bottom of the theory that Covid-19 first leaked from a virology lab in Wuhan, China, Atlantic Council senior fellow Jamie Metzl told CNBC on Monday. "Right now, the World Health Assembly is meeting, and the United States should be doing everything possible with our allies to demand a comprehensive investigation into Covid origins with full access to all the records, samples, and personnel in China and beyond," Metzl, a former national security official in the Clinton administration, said on "The News with Shepard Smith."  "If China wants to thumb its nose at the rest of the world, in spite of more than 3 million people dead, let them make that statement," he said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that determining the origins of Covid-19 is up to an international investigation led by the World Health Organization, and that the U.S. cannot lead a probe on its own. Metzl organized last year a group of scientists and academics to call for a deeper investigation into Covid's origins. He told host Shepard Smith that it's "critically important" to find answers about the pandemic's origins because if we don't, it puts everyone "unnecessarily at risk." The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The World Health Organization has repeatedly said the virus most likely jumped from bats to humans through another animal. It has described the theory that the virus leaked from a lab as "extremely unlikely," but has not ruled it out. Metzl said he thinks the theory is a "likely hypothesis." "Why would you have a bat coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan and not in southern China, where the horseshoe bats are located? And what we know that they do have in Wuhan, is China's only level 4 virology institute, with the world's largest collection of bat coronaviruses, that was doing aggressive research designed to make those pathogens more dangerous," Metzl said.
President Joe Biden on Friday will order a bipartisan commission to study a slew of potential reforms to the U.S. Supreme Court, the White House said. The reforms include the politically volatile question of whether the high court's membership should be expanded beyond the current nine justices. The executive order marks the fulfillment of Biden's campaign promise to convene experts to look into the myriad debates about the Supreme Court's structure. The commission will issue a report within 180 days of its first meeting, the White House said.	President Joe Biden on Friday will order a bipartisan commission to study a slew of potential reforms to the U.S. Supreme Court, including the politically volatile question of whether the high court should be expanded. The new commission, which comprises dozens of legal scholars and others, will also examine the "length of service and turnover of justices," the White House said Friday in a press release announcing the executive order. The group will hold public meetings to hear "varied perspectives on the issues it will be examining" and will issue a report within 180 days after the first meeting is held, the White House said. "This action is part of the Administration's commitment to closely study measures to improve the federal judiciary, including those that would expand access [to] the court system," the press release said. The order marks the fulfillment of Biden's campaign promise to convene a group of experts to look into the myriad debates about the Supreme Court's structure. Then-candidate Biden had refused to explicitly rule out the idea of adding members to the nine-seat bench , raising the hackles of Republicans who staunchly oppose the prospect of "court packing" by the president. Beyond the size of the Supreme Court and the length of service, the commission will delve into topics as broad as the court's role in the U.S. constitutional system itself, according to the press release. It will also look at "the genesis of the reform debate" and the court's "case selection, rules, and practices," the White House said. Justices confirmed to the high court serve lifetime appointments, and the court's opinions are decided by majority. Former President Donald Trump selected three associate justices in a single term in office, swinging the ideological makeup of the court sharply to the right. Trump's final nominee, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, was sworn in just eight days before the election Trump lost to Biden. The court's solidly conservative 6-3 majority could hold for years to come. Biden as a presidential candidate had been circumspect about whether he'd even entertain a debate on expanding the court. The death of liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last September set off a political firestorm, with Trump and Republicans scrambling to fill her seat before Election Day and Democrats demanding the selection process be delayed. The GOP warned before polls closed that Biden if elected would seek to pack the courts, while progressives heaped pressure on Biden to commit to doing just that . In October, Biden said he was "not a fan of court packing ," adding, "I don't want to get off on that whole issue." The White House on Friday said the new commission would be co-chaired by New York University School of Law professor and ex-White House counsel Bob Bauer and Yale Law School professor Cristina Rodriguez.
President Joe Biden plans to meet with bipartisan members of the House and Senate on Monday to discuss his more than $2 trillion infrastructure plan. The president has said he wants to hear out Republican ideas, but signaled he would move forward with only Democrats if the GOP refuses to address what he considers the country's needs. The GOP has called for a smaller infrastructure bill and opposed the corporate tax increase contained in Biden's plan.	President Joe Biden will meet with bipartisan members of Congress on Monday as he tries to sell his more than $2 trillion infrastructure plan, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday. Congress will return to Washington next week for the first time since Biden unveiled his proposal, which would inject money into roads, bridges, airports, broadband, electric vehicles, housing and job training, while hiking the corporate tax rate to 28%. The president faces a slog getting the bill through the House and Senate, where Democrats hold narrow majorities and Republicans are skeptical of a huge spending package. Biden on Monday will stress "the need for a bold, once-in-a-generation investment in America to put millions of people to work," Psaki said. She added that the administration expects to release a list of attendees on Monday. Since unveiling his plan, Biden has said he would listen to input from "any Republican who wants to get this done." The meeting will start the president's effort to hear out the GOP — even if the differences between the parties' visions for an infrastructure bill may prevent them from working together. Biden signaled he could try to pass legislation with only Democratic votes through a special budget process if Republicans refuse to address what he considers the needs of the moment. The GOP has not only called for spending a fraction of the president's desired price tag on infrastructure, but also argued a corporate tax increase would hamstring the economy. Biden's plan calls to hike the rate to 28%, after Republicans cut it to 21% from 35% as part of their 2017 tax law. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, among others, has pushed Biden to try to negotiate a deal with Republicans. The senator signaled this week that he could oppose the repeated use of budget reconciliation to pass bills without GOP votes. Manchin, whose vote Democrats will need to get a bill through the Senate, has also said he prefers a 25% corporate tax rate to 28%. Biden said this week that he is "willing to negotiate" the tax rate. The infrastructure plan is Biden's second major legislative push since he took office in January. Democrats passed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package last month. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday that she hopes her chamber can pass an infrastructure bill as soon as July. Democrats then want to turn to separate legislation that would address paid leave, education and health care. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
President Joe Biden on Sunday declared the settlement between two Korean battery makers a victory for U.S. efforts to build a strong supply chain for electric vehicles in order to create jobs and curb climate change. The settlement between LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation Co. will allow two plants in Georgia to move forward with plans to produce lithium ion batteries for Ford and Volkswagen. Biden recently unveiled a sweeping infrastructure plan that includes $174 billion in spending to boost the electric vehicle market and shift away from gas-powered cars.	President Joe Biden on Sunday declared the settlement between two Korean battery makers a victory for U.S. efforts to build a strong supply chain for electric vehicles in order to create clean energy jobs and curb climate change . The settlement over a trade secrets dispute between LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation will allow two plants in Georgia to move forward with plans to produce lithium ion batteries for Ford and Volkswagen . The companies agreed to drop litigation in the U.S. and South Korea and not pursue further lawsuits for a decade. SK Innovation will also pay LG Energy Solution $1.8 billion in cash and royalties. The deal came before the Biden administration's deadline Sunday evening to reverse a U.S. International Trade Commission decision unless the battery makers reached a settlement. The settlement is a major win for the administration, which recently unveiled a sweeping infrastructure plan that includes $174 billion in spending to boost the electric vehicle market and shift away from gas-powered cars. "We need a strong, diversified and resilient U.S.-based electric vehicle battery supply chain, so we can supply the growing global demand for these vehicles and components — creating good-paying jobs here at home, and laying the groundwork for the jobs of tomorrow," Biden said in a statement. The president's proposal involves installing at least 500,000 charging stations across the country by 2030, incentives for Americans to purchase EVs and money to retool factories and boost domestic supply of materials. A failure to resolve the dispute may have cost thousands of jobs in Georgia and threatened the country's EV market, which comprises roughly 2% of new auto sales. The ITC ruled in February that SK Innovation had stolen trade secrets related to EV batteries, and ordered the U.S. to block the company from importing supplies to build batteries. SK Innovation threatened to abandon its $2.6 billion plant in Georgia — which is under construction and could employ 2,600 workers — unless the ITC decision was overruled. If no settlement was reached, the Biden administration may have had to overrule the ITC in order to allow SK Innovation to build the plant. Otherwise, Volkswagen and Ford would have had to find new battery suppliers, a task that may have delayed model releases and thwarted their ability to meet escalating demand for EVs. "Today's settlement is a positive step in that direction, which will bring some welcome relief to workers in Georgia and new opportunity for workers across the country," Biden said. Jong Hyun Kim, CEO of LG Energy Solution, and Jun Kim, CEO of SK Innovation, said in a joint statement that the firms would "compete in an amicable way, all for the future of the U.S. and South Korean electric vehicle battery industries." "We are dedicated to work together to support the Biden administration's climate agenda and to develop a robust U.S. supply chain," they said.
The Republican Senate fundraising group gave former President Donald Trump a "Champion for Freedom Award" a day before he blasted top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell, as a "son of a b----" and "stone-cold loser." Trump for months has raged against McConnell, who as majority leader refused to endorse Trump's efforts to block the confirmation of his rival Joe Biden as president. Trump has falsely claimed he won the election, and blamed widespread ballot fraud for his electoral loss.	The leading Republican Senate fundraising group handed former President Donald Trump its inaugural "Champion for Freedom Award" — just a day before he blasted top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell as a "son of a b----" and a "stone-cold loser." The National Republican Senatorial Committee award also came after Trump threatened to endorse Republican challengers to GOP incumbents in Congress , and after his lawyers sent cease-and-desist letters to three top Republican committees, including the NRSC, telling them to stop using his name for fundraising without his permission. NRSC chairman Sen. Rick Scott of Florida handed the small silver award to Trump — who was dressed as if he just walked off the golf course — on Friday at the ex-president's club in Mar-a-Lago in Florida. McConnell, R-Ky., the Senate minority leader, would likely resume his former role as majority leader if the NRSC and other groups manage to help elect enough Republicans during the 2022 midterms to overcome the Senate's current 50-50 split between the parties. Vice President Kamala Harris ' tie-breaking vote in the Senate gives Democrats majority control in the upper chamber of Congress. Trump for months has raged against McConnell, R-Ky., who as majority leader in January refused to endorse Trump's efforts to get Congress to block the confirmation of Joe Biden 's electoral victory. Trump has falsely claimed since November that he won the election, and that only widespread ballot fraud made it seem that Biden had won. A day after getting his award, Trump reportedly lashed out at McConnell as the former president was speaking to a group of Republican donors at Mar-a-Lago. Trump claimed that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would have overturned the election results if a Democratic candidate stood to gain. "If that were Schumer instead of this dumb son of a b--- Mitch McConnell, they would never allow it to happen," Trump told the crowd at the event, which was held by the Republican National Committee. "They would have fought it." A source told NBC News that Trump griped that "a real leader" never would have accepted the Electoral College results showing he lost. Trump also went after McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, who resigned as Trump's Transportation secretary a day after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot , where supporters of the then-president rampaged through the halls of Congress, disrupting proceedings that were confirming Biden's victory. "I hired his wife," Trump griped. "Did he ever say thank you?" "She suffered so greatly," Trump said sarcastically. McConnell did not respond Monday while walking by an NBC News reporter who asked him if he had any response to Trump's tart comments on him. McConnell has blamed Trump for inciting the riot , but he voted against convicting the former president at his Senate impeachment trial in February. The National Republican Senatorial Committee said Monday that its Champion of Freedom award is "presented to conservative leaders who have worked tirelessly to create good jobs, protect the values that make our country great, and stop the Democrats' socialist agenda." "As president, Donald Trump delivered for the American people by appointing three pro-Constitution judges to the Supreme Court, cutting taxes for middle-class families and job creators, and securing the border," the NRSC said in a statement. On Sunday, the second ranking Republican in the party's leadership in the Senate, Minority Whip John Thune of South Dakota, did not criticize Trump for his attack on McConnell. Thune, when asked on "Fox News Sunday" about Trump's scathing remarks, said he believes "a lot of that rhetoric is part of the style and tone that comes with the former president." "But I think he and Mitch McConnell have a common goal," said Thune. "And that is getting the majority back in 2022, and hopefully in the end that will be the thing that unites us."
A top Biden administration health official said Michigan should "shut things down" as it grapples with an overwhelming surge in coronavirus cases. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said a boost in Covid vaccinations alone isn't the answer — even as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer urges the federal government to send the state more vaccines. Whitmer has been reluctant to order new restrictions in response to the most recent surge in cases.	A top Biden administration health official said Monday that Michigan should "shut things down" as it grapples with an overwhelming surge in coronavirus cases. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said a boost in Covid-19 vaccinations alone isn't the answer — even as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer calls on the federal government to send more vaccines her way. "I think if we try to vaccinate our way out of what is happening in Michigan, we would be disappointed that it took so long for the vaccine to work, to actually have the impact," Walensky said during a White House briefing on the pandemic. It takes several weeks for immunizations to kick in and reduce the caseload, she noted. The state's best bet, Walensky said, "is to really close things down." Walensky called on Michigan "to go back to where we were last spring, last summer and to shut things down, to flatten the curve, to decrease contact with one another" and to ramp up testing and contact tracing efforts. Cases in Michigan have dramatically risen in recent weeks, averaging 7,359 new cases per day over the last week and approaching its pandemic highs set around Thanksgiving, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Deaths are also on the rise . "Really what we need to do in those situations is shut things down," Walensky said. Whitmer, a Democrat in a politically purple state where shutdowns have been especially controversial , has been reluctant to order new restrictions in response to the most recent surge in cases. Last week, she asked residents in her state to voluntarily limit their activities and urged schools to temporarily halt in-person learning . But she stressed that "to be very clear, these are not orders, mandates or requirements." No state is recording more daily infections on a per capita basis than Michigan, according to a CNBC analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. Much of the current surge stems from a highly infectious variant of Covid, B.1.1.7, which is now the most common strain of the virus in the U.S . Whitmer on Friday called on President Joe Biden's administration to flood her state with vaccines, going so far as to urge the government to "create a vaccination surge program to help states like Michigan." The administration is reportedly willing to rush some resources to the state, but not vaccines. Walensky, without addressing Whitmer directly, pushed back on the calls for shipping extra vaccines out to states with severe outbreaks. "There are different tools that we can use for different periods" of an outbreak, Walensky said at Monday's briefing. "We know that if vaccines go in arms today, we will not see an effect of those vaccines, depending on the vaccine, for somewhere between two to six weeks," she said. "So when you have an acute situation, extraordinary number of cases like we have in Michigan, the answer is not necessarily to give vaccine. In fact, we know that the vaccine will have a delayed response." "Similarly, we need that vaccine in other places," Walensky said. "If we vaccinate today, we will have impact in six weeks, and we don't know where the next place is going to be that is going to surge." — CNBC's Berkeley Lovelace Jr. contributed to this report.
The White House is using alternative methods to reach Americans who remain reluctant to get a Covid-19 vaccine: NASCAR, CMT, the country music television channel, and shows like "Deadliest Catch." According to a recent Kaiser Health News poll, "Republicans and white evangelical Christians were the most likely to say they will not get vaccinated, with almost 30% of each group saying they will 'definitely not' get a shot."	The White House is using alternative methods to reach Americans who remain reluctant to get a Covid-19 vaccine: NASCAR, CMT, the country music television channel, and shows like "Deadliest Catch," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. "We've run PSAs on the 'Deadliest Catch,' we're engaged with NASCAR and country nusic TV. We're looking for a range of creative ways to get directly connected to white conservative communities," Psaki said. According to a recent Kaiser Health News poll , "Republicans and white evangelical Christians were the most likely to say they will not get vaccinated, with almost 30% of each group saying they will 'definitely not' get a shot." A PBS/NPR Marist poll found that 49% of Republican men said they would not choose to be vaccinated if the shot were made available to them, compared with 34% of Republican women given the same opportunity. And in 311 counties where at least 80% of constituents voted for Donald Trump in the 2020 election, The Washington Post reports the vaccination rate is 3% lower than the national average. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., last week urged his fellow Republicans to get vaccinated, saying, "I'm a Republican man and I want to say to everyone, we need to take this vaccine. These reservations need to be put aside." The White House is inching closer to its updated goal of 200 million shots in arms in President Joe Biden 's first 100 days in office, which is just under three weeks away. But virus variants are spreading in many states, creating uncertainty and a rush to get more Americans immunized.
President Joe Biden said he is "prepared to negotiate" the size of his infrastructure plan and how to pay for it. The president met with lawmakers from both parties about the more than $2 trillion proposal as they returned to Washington following a recess. Biden said he and lawmakers will have to agree on whether broadband and utilities are considered infrastructure.	President Joe Biden said Monday that he is ready to bargain with lawmakers about changes to his more than $2 trillion infrastructure plan. "I'm prepared to negotiate as to the extent of my infrastructure project as well as how we pay for it. ... I think everyone acknowledges we need a significant increase in infrastructure. It's going to get down to what we call infrastructure," the president said ahead of an Oval Office meeting with House and Senate members from both parties. The president has said he will engage with Republicans skeptical of his proposal and try to win their support for the package. Still, Biden has stressed he will move forward without GOP votes because he considers a jobs plan necessary as the country recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. The Democratic-held Congress returns to Washington this week from recess with infrastructure at the top of its agenda. Lawmakers will likely take months to craft and pass massive legislation that would affect everything from roads, bridges, airports and trains to broadband, housing, utilities and job training. It would also hike the corporate tax rate and seek to deter offshoring of corporate profits. The proposed tax hikes have irked Republicans. In a statement following the meeting, the White House said Biden and lawmakers "had a good exchange of ideas, and the President asked for their feedback and follow-up on proposals discussed in the meeting, while underscoring that inaction is not an option." Democrats want a large-scale package that addresses policies not considered traditional transportation infrastructure, including an expansion of broadband access and improvements to drinking-water systems and electric grids. Many Republicans have argued an infrastructure bill should only tackle transportation. Before the meeting, Biden said water systems and broadband should be considered infrastructure. "It's not just roads, bridges, highways," he said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., again criticized Democrats on Monday for what he called fitting unrelated priorities into the plan. "They are embarking on a campaign to convince everybody that any government policy whatsoever can be labeled infrastructure," he said. The attendees at Monday's meeting included Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and ranking member Roger Wicker, R-Miss. The panel has broad jurisdiction over communications technology, highways and aviation, among other areas. Wicker is not among the Senate Republicans seen as most likely to broker a deal with the Biden administration. Biden also noted that Rep. Don Young, an Alaska Republican and the longest currently serving House member, attended the meeting Monday. Biden administration officials briefed senators from both parties on the proposal last week, NBC News reported. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., also started to reach out to representatives about projects they would like to see included in the bill, according to NBC. Republicans have signaled they will support an infrastructure bill only if Biden slashes the scope and price tag of his proposal. GOP lawmakers have also criticized Biden's plan to increase the corporate tax rate to 28% to offset the investments. Republicans cut the rate to 21% from 35% in 2017. If Democrats choose to pass the bill by themselves through budget reconciliation, Biden will have to navigate dissent within his own party. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., has urged Biden to raise the corporate rate to 25% rather than 28%. At the same time, progressives have pushed the president to take more aggressive action to combat climate change and transition to green energy. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
Wright, 20, was shot after he was pulled over in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center for allegedly having an air freshener hanging from his rear-view mirror, which is illegal in Minnesota. President Joe Biden on Monday called for "peace and calm" in the wake of the "tragic" fatal police shooting of Daunte Wright in Minnesota. "There are already federal resources," Biden said. "There will not be a lack of help and support from the federal government if the local authorities believe it's needed."	President Joe Biden on Monday called for "peace and calm" in the wake of the "tragic" fatal police shooting of Daunte Wright in Minnesota. "I haven't called Daunte Wright's family, but my prayers are with the family. It's really a tragic thing that happened," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office of Wright's death Sunday. "The question is, was it an accident? Was it intentional? That remains to be determined by a full-blown investigation," he said, describing the body-camera footage of the shooting as "fairly graphic." Wright, 20, was shot after he was pulled over in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center for allegedly having an air freshener hanging from his rear-view mirror, which is illegal in Minnesota. Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon said he believes, based on the body camera footage, that the officer who shot Wright mistakenly believed she was firing a taser and not her gun. The shooting took place about 14 miles north of where George Floyd was killed last year, as former police officer Derek Chauvin is standing trial for Floyd's murder. Floyd's death set off a wave of protests across the country last year, some of which led to rioting and looting. Biden called for any protests to Wright's shooting to remain "peaceful," echoing a plea from Wright's mother. "There is absolutely no justification, none, for looting, no justification for violence. Peaceful protests, understandable, and the fact is that, you know, we do know, that the anger, pain, and trauma that exists in the Black community in that environment is real, it's serious, and it's consequential. But it will not justify violence and/or looting," he said. "And we should listen to Daunte's mom, who is calling for peace and calm," he said. Asked if he'd deploy federal resources to help keep the peace if necessary, Biden noted that he'd already done so because of the Chauvin trial. "There are already federal resources," Biden said. "There will not be a lack of help and support from the federal government if the local authorities believe it's needed."
Michael Cohen, the former personal lawyer for ex-President Donald Trump, on Monday urged a federal judge to suspend his criminal sentence of home confinement. The request came as Cohen separately is expected later this week to meet — for the ninth time — with investigators from the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. who are conducting a wide-ranging criminal probe of Trump and the Trump Organization. Vance is known to be investigating how the Trump firm accounted for hush-money payments Cohen facilitated for two women in 2016 and is probing Cohen's allegations to Congress that the Trump Organization artificially manipulated the valuation of real estate assets.	Michael Cohen, the former personal lawyer for ex-President Donald Trump, on Monday urged a federal judge to suspend his criminal sentence of home confinement while the judge weighs his request to declare his punishment satisfied by work and education credits obtained in prison. The request came as Cohen is separately expected later this week to meet — for the ninth time — with investigators from the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. who are conducting a wide-ranging criminal probe of Trump and the Trump Organization, a source familiar with the case told CNBC. Cohen's sentence request is unrelated to his cooperation with Vance's investigation, which is the most serious exposure to criminal prosecution that Trump currently faces. Vance is known to be investigating how the Trump firm accounted for hush-money payments Cohen facilitated for two women in 2016 and is probing Cohen's allegations to Congress that the Trump Organization artificially manipulated the valuation of real estate assets to benefit financially. In a letter to U.S. District Judge John Koetl, Cohen wrote that every day his home confinement in Manhattan continues "is a day Mr. Cohen is incarcerated unlawfully." Cohen wrote that he wants Koetl to "order his release pending adjudication" of the question of whether his criminal sentence has already been satisfied. He also wrote, "The impetus for said request stems from the well-known fact that The Bureau of Prisons conspicuously slow walks these petitions to moot the determination; especially in matters like the one before Your Honor where Petitioner will be released from home confinement in 7 months." If Koetl granted that request, Cohen would be allowed to leave his Upper East Side residence at will, at least until the judge ultimately rules on his legal bid to have his sentence declared complete. Cohen, who pleaded guilty to tax evasion, unlawful campaign contributions and making a false statement to Congress , was released into home confinement last spring after serving slightly more than one year of his three-year prison sentence due to coronavirus concerns. In his pending petition to Koetl in Manhattan federal court, Cohen argued that his sentence is completed because of courses and work assignments he finished in prison, which earned him credit for time under the First Step Act, which Trump signed into law. Cohen argues that his latest possible release date is May 29. Cohen told CNBC, "This letter to Judge Koetl and my underlying writ of habeas corpus seeks judicial intervention to force the Bureau of Prisons to provide me with what I am entitled to under the terms of the First Step Act. Nothing more, nothing less." And, Cohen added, "This petition has nothing to do with my ongoing, continuous cooperation with the district attorney's office, the [New York state] Attorney General's office or any other investigation in which I'm involved." New York Attorney General Letitia James is conducting a civil investigation of the Trump Organization, which, like Vance's criminal probe , is eyeing whether the company improperly stated the value of the same property assets at different times, benefiting from lower tax expenses and insurance costs when the valuations were lower than what were stated for loan purposes. Federal prosecutors argued that Cohen is not eligible to receive earned time credits for any of the work or courses he identified "primarily because Cohen does not have a need for purposes of lowering his risk of recidivism in any of the areas in which he completed courses or work." A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the entity that is opposing Cohen's bid, declined to comment Monday. In his letter Monday, Cohen also brought to Koetl's attention a filing in another case involving a federal inmate in which prosecutors appear to have dropped two "misguided and flawed defenses" that they used in Cohen's case. Those defenses are that Cohen's claim for a ruling from Koetl is not legally ripe because the First Step Act has not taken full effect and because he has not exhausted administrative appeals to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. Cohen began cooperating with Vance's probe before he went to prison and continued talking to investigators while locked up and after his release into home confinement. Cohen most recently met with top officials in Vance's office in mid-March.
More than 300 businesses have called on President Joe Biden to nearly double U.S. targets to reduce planet-warming emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. The push by leaders from companies like Google, Apple, Walmart and Unilever comes ahead of the global leaders' climate summit the Biden administration is hosting next week. The Obama administration set out to cut emissions by up to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025, but former President Donald Trump halted federal efforts to meet that target.	More than 300 businesses and investors are calling on President Joe Biden to nearly double U.S. targets to reduce planet-warming emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. In a letter published Tuesday , corporate leaders from companies like Google , Apple , Walmart , Unilever and General Electric praised the Biden administration for rejoining the Paris climate accord and aggressively addressing climate change . The push by executives of some of the country's largest companies to set a goal to slash emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases by at least 50% — a target in line with what environmental groups want — comes ahead of the global leaders' climate summit the administration is hosting April 22. The White House plans to unveil a stricter emissions target for the Paris accord on or before the summit of world leaders. The Obama administration set out to cut emissions by up to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025, but former President Donald Trump halted federal efforts to meet that target and pulled the U.S. from the Paris accord. The companies that signed the letter comprise more than $3 trillion in annual revenue and more than $1 trillion in assets. The letter indicates a shift by the private sector to address their own climate change impact and better align with the goals of the Biden administration, which has vowed to put the country on a path to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Biden's climate ambitions, including a sweeping infrastructure package that invests heavily in clean energy technologies , would be paid for largely by raising corporate tax rates, a move that could trigger objections from some of the very corporations who signed the letter. The president has also promised to adopt new regulations for fossil fuel producers, automobiles and electric utilities. Signatories of the letter include utilities like PG&E Corp. and Exelon but no notable oil and gas companies. "Many of us have set or are setting emissions reduction goals in line with climate science since the establishment of the Paris agreement," the letter said. "The private sector has purchased renewable energy at record rates and along with countless cities across the country, many have committed themselves to a net zero-emissions future." Nearly every country is part of the Paris agreement, a landmark nonbinding accord among nearly 200 nations to reduce their planet-warming emissions. The U.S. is the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases.
Minnesota Police Officer Kim Potter resigned two days after fatally shooting Daunte Wright, an unarmed Black man who was fleeing a traffic stop. Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon also resigned Tuesday, a day after revealing that Potter likely shot Wright in the mistaken belief that she was holding a Taser, and not her pistol. Vice President Kamala Harris said Wright "should be alive today" as demands grew for police reform on the heels of the latest killing by Minnesota police. Ex-President Barack Obama argued Wright's death underscores the need to "reimagine policing" in the United States. Wright was killed about 14 miles away from where George Floyd died in Minneapolis last year at the hands of a city cop, Derek Chauvin, whose murder trial is ongoing.	Police Officer Kim Potter resigned Tuesday, two days after fatally shooting Daunte Wright, an unarmed Black man who was fleeing a traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb. Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon also resigned Tuesday, a day after revealing that Potter likely shot Wright in the mistaken belief that she was holding a Taser, and not her pistol. Potter, who served 26 years on the Brooklyn Center police force, said she loved being a cop, but was quitting because "I believe it is in the best interest of the community, the department, and my fellow officers if I resign immediately," according to a letter posted on Twitter by multiple news outlets. Her resignation came as Vice President Kamala Harris said Wright "should be alive today" as demands grew for police reform on the heels of the latest controversial killing of a Black man by Minnesota police. Harris also said that there should be "justice and healing" for Wright's death, and that, "Law enforcement must be held to the highest standards of accountability." Former President Barack Obama said that his and Michelle Obama's "hearts are heavy" over Wright's shooting death. Obama also argued that the latest death of a Black man at the hands of police underscores the need to "reimagine policing" in the United States. Wright, 20, was driving an SUV when it was stopped Sunday afternoon by police for having expired license plates and an air freshener hanging from his rearview mirror . Police then moved to arrest Wright on an outstanding warrant for failing to appear in court in a criminal case, where he was charged with carrying a gun without a permit, as well as with fleeing from police in June. Video from Potter's body camera shows that Wright twisted away and ducked into his car when another police officer was trying to handcuff him. Potter then fired a single shot into Wright's chest with her pistol after she repeatedly and frantically yelled "Taser!" Gannon told reporters Monday, "It is my belief that the officer had the intention to deploy their Taser but instead shot Mr. Wright with a single bullet." Potter's apparent confusion over what weapon she was holding has been widely criticized. Tasers are yellow colored, unlike a black pistol that Potter had in her hand, and are as a rule kept holstered on the side opposite a police officer's dominant shooting hand. Both precautions are designed to avoid a police officer pulling out a gun when they mean to use a Taser to force a suspect to comply with their demands or to avoid hurting someone else. Before she resigned, Potter, who has served as president of her town's police union, had been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Gannon was replaced by Commander Tony Greuning, a 19-year Brooklyn Center Police Department veteran, who will serve as acting chief. Wright's shooting was followed by protests and looting in Brooklyn Center and nearby Minneapolis. The site of his shooting is about 14 miles away from where George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, last year, after Floyd was detained on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill. Prosecutors on Tuesday morning rested their case in Chauvin's ongoing murder trial. Floyd's death ignited a national wave of protests and calls for police reform. Obama noted the coincidence of Wright's death and Chauvin's trial in his statement, which called Floyd's death a "murder" despite no jury verdict being reached yet in the case. "The fact that this could happen even as the city of Minneapolis is going through the trial of Derek Chauvin and reliving the heart-wrenching murder of George Floyd indicates not just how important it is to conduct a full and transparent investigation, but also just how badly we need to reimagine policing and public safety in this country," Obama said. "Michelle and I grieve alongside the Wright family for their loss," Obama said in a statement. "We empathize with the pain that Black mothers, fathers, and children are feeling after yet another senseless tragedy," said Obama, who became the first black U.S. president in 2009. "And we will continue to work with all fair-minded Americans to confront historical inequities and bring about nationwide changes that are so long overdue." The families of both Floyd and Wright, along with their civil rights attorney Ben Crump, were scheduled to hold a news conference Tuesday in Minneapolis. Crump said in a statement: "Daunte Wright is yet another young Black man killed at the hands of those who have sworn to protect and serve all of us — not just the whitest among us." "As Minneapolis and the rest of the country continue to deal with the tragic killing of George Floyd, now we must also mourn the loss of this young man and father. This level of lethal force was entirely preventable and inhumane," Crump said. Police in Minneapolis said they made about 40 arrests on Monday night for conduct ranging from curfew violations to rioting. Looting in the city was sporadic and limited to five retail locations, cops said. Booker Hodges, assistant commissioner for the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, told reporters early Tuesday that "We just want to say thank you for all the people that came out and exercised their First Amendment rights in a peaceful manner." "Unfortunately, there were those that decided not to do that. And the plans that we have put in place over the last few months were executed," he said. "For months we've been saying that riotous behavior is just not going to be tolerated and unfortunately tonight, that is some of the things that we encountered." President Joe Biden sai d Monday that he had not spoken with Wright's family, "but my prayers are with the family." "It's really a tragic thing that happened," Biden said. "But I think we gotta wait and see what the investigation shows – and the entire investigation. You've all watched, I assume, as I did, the film, which is ... fairly graphic. The question is, was it an accident, was it intentional? That remains to be determined by a full-blown investigation." Biden added, "I want to make it clear again, there is absolutely no justification, none, for looting, no justification for violence." "Peaceful protests, understandable, and the fact is that, you know, we do know that the anger, pain, and trauma that exists in the Black community in that environment is real, it's serious, and it's consequential," the president said. "But it will not justify violence and or looting."
The Biden administration is not considering a hike to the federal gasoline tax as a way to help pay for its landmark infrastructure proposal. A reporter asked White House press secretary Jen Psaki to address earlier reports that suggested Biden could try to raise the tax from 18.4 cents per gallon. Biden "does not believe that paying for this historic investment in rebuilding our nation's infrastructure and creating millions of jobs should be on the backs of Americans," she said.	The Biden administration is not considering a hike to the federal gasoline tax as a way to help pay for its landmark infrastructure proposal, according to the White House's top spokeswoman. The subject of the gasoline tax came up during press secretary Jen Psaki's briefing Tuesday afternoon, when a reporter asked her to address reports on Monday that suggested President Joe Biden could be open to raising the gas tax from its current 18.4 cents per gallon. "In yesterday's meeting with members of Congress, the president mentioned the gas tax only to make a point that even a significant increase in the gas tax, which some people have proposed, would pay only for a fraction of the investment the country needs," she said. "Now, fundamentally, he does not believe that paying for this historic investment in rebuilding our nation's infrastructure and creating millions of jobs should be on the backs of Americans." Asked to confirm that a gas tax hike is not being discussed right now, Psaki answered: "Correct." That the White House is not considering an increase to the gas tax is notable given the early hurdles the administration faces in trying to sell its plan to Capitol Hill. Republicans and Democrats like the idea of repairing the nation's roads and bridges, expanding access to broadband and ensuring access to job training. But the Biden plan's $2 trillion price tag has politicians in both parties concerned about the scope of the proposal and ways to pay for what would be another multitrillion-dollar fiscal stimulus. To date, the White House has floated the idea of raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and has sought to deter offshoring of business profits. Biden, who met with a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Monday about the infrastructure plan, has said he will engage with Republicans skeptical of the American Jobs Plan and hear their criticisms. Still, the president has warned that he is willing to move forward on the plan without Republican votes because he views the plan as critical to the economy's recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. The gas tax concept is often criticized for having a disproportionate impact on rural and low-income communities. It also wouldn't be a viable long-term option for an administration hoping to persuade more Americans to trade their gas-powered cars for electric vehicles. Other than a gas tax, Biden could opt to explore income taxes, a mileage tax, monetizing the electrical grid or financing the plan by covering the interest costs associated with taxable municipal bonds.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., held a hearing on Tuesday urging President Joe Biden to cancel student debt. More than 415 organizations sent a letter to the president pressuring him to do the same.	While the latest Covid stimulus package and a new massive infrastructure bill are the main topics of conversation in Washington of late, President Joe Biden continues to be under mounting pressure to take action on student loan forgiveness, too. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., held a hearing Tuesday afternoon on the burden of student loan debt and urged Biden to cancel the loans as soon as possible. "America is facing a student loan time bomb that, when it explodes, could throw millions of families over a financial cliff," Warren said. "The average borrower will have to start paying nearly $400 a month to the government instead of spending that money out in the economy." Warren also discussed the racial inequities of student debt, pointing out that the median Black borrower still owes 95% of the original amount they borrowed 20 years after taking out the loans. The median White borrower, meanwhile, owes just 6% of the original amount they borrowed two decades later. "This is the single most powerful executive action President Biden could take to advance racial equity and give everyone in America a chance to build a future," Warren said. More from Personal Finance: More colleges make Covid vaccines mandatory New college grad job outlook looks promising Under Biden, free college could become a reality Also on Tuesday, more than 415 organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Psychological Association and the Consumer Federation of America, wrote a letter to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris calling on the White House to use executive authority "to cancel federal student debt immediately." "Before the Covid-19 public health crisis began, student debt was already a drag on the national economy, weighing heaviest on Black and Latinx communities, as well as women," the organizations wrote. "Administrative debt cancellation will deliver real progress on your racial equity, economic recovery, and Covid-19 relief campaign priorities." The Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, and other Democratic legislators have also called on the White House to forgive $50,000 in student debt for all borrowers by executive action. "You don't need Congress," Schumer has said. "All you need is the flick of a pen." On the campaign trail, Biden said he supported $10,000 in student loan forgiveness, but he is under mounting pressure from members of his own party, advocates and borrowers to go further by canceling $50,000 per person and to do so through executive action . White House press secretary Jen Psaki suggested recently that the administration hadn't ruled out the possibility of forgiving the debt without Congress. On his first day in office, Biden extended a pause on payments for federal student loan borrowers that has been in effect since March until this coming September. And Biden has asked Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to prepare a report on the president's legal authority to cancel up to $50,000 in student debt per borrower. The findings of that memo are yet to be released publicly. Critics of student loan forgiveness argue that it wouldn't significantly stimulate the economy since college graduates tend to be higher earners who would likely redirect their monthly payments to savings rather than additional spending. Others say it would be unfair to those who've already paid off their student debt or never took out loans, and would send the message that it's OK for people to ditch their debts. Advocates say that borrowers were already struggling before the public health crisis — with more than 1 in 4 borrowers in delinquency or default — and that after a year of record-high unemployment levels, that pain has only worsened. The vast majority — or around 90% — of federal student loan borrowers have taken advantage of the government's option to pause their monthly payments during the coronavirus pandemic , data shows. And in a recent Pew survey, 6 in 10 borrowers said it would be difficult for them to start repaying their student loans again in the coming month. Proponents also point out that it's people of color bearing the brunt of the student loan crisis , and it's also Black and Latino Americans who've suffered most from the coronavirus pandemic . An aide to Sen. Warren said canceling student debt would make the biggest strides toward narrowing the racial wealth gap since the civil rights movement. One survey found that 58% of registered voters are in support of student loan forgiveness, and a Change.org petition calling on the president to cancel student debt has now garnered close to 1 million signatures .

Donors and strategists met at Mar-a-Lago, ex-President Trump's resort, to discuss a "strategy on social media and big tech," according to conservative lobbyist an activist Matt Schlapp. Roy Bailey, a key fundraiser for Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, said he expressed interest in investing in a new online platform that would be a counterweight to Facebook and Twitter.	Many top Republican donors, lawmakers and strategists huddled privately over the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida resort owned by former President Donald Trump, to discuss ways the party can take on corporate America and Big Tech, according to several attendees. Donors and strategists met throughout the weekend to discuss a "strategy on social media and big tech," according to Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, who said he has been part of these conversations. "I'm participating in a lot of conservations with people who have substantial means, and there are going to be new ways for people to get there information and to share information and to stay connected with each other," Schlapp said. He later defined most of these conversations as "informal" and that "plans are still coming together." One major player, Republican donor Roy Bailey, told CNBC that he is interested in potentially investing in a social media platform tailored for conservatives, to counter Facebook and Twitter. "It is something I'm interested in if it can be put together properly," said Bailey, a Texas businessman who was a key fundraiser for Trump's 2020 campaign. "I've identified a potential platform and there's a lot of work to do." The concept is in its early stages, he said. Bailey also noted that the "platform would be where conservatives can control their own destiny and not worry about censorship." He declined to comment further on the effort. Todd Ricketts, a longtime GOP donor who is also the RNC finance chair, is being floated as a potential investor in such a platform. "He always looks at investing into companies that upend established markets," Brian Baker, a spokesman for Ricketts, told CNBC. The discussions come as the party feuds with major corporate leaders over new voting laws pushed by Republicans in states such as Georgia. The tension also comes more than three years after Trump and congressional Republicans lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. Numerous corporate leaders have come out against the Georgia law and others across the country that critics say restrict voters from participating in elections. Top Republicans have often publicly blasted social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter, claiming they censor conservative voices. The companies deny these accusations. Trump was banned from the two social media platforms in the wake of the deadly Capitol Hill riot on Jan. 6. He was later impeached for inciting the riot, but was ultimately acquitted in the Senate. There is also infighting among Republicans. Trump on Saturday during the portion of the RNC retreat at Mar-a-Lago t ook aim at Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., for helping certify the results of the 2020 election. Schlapp said that there were also broad discussions over how to respond to what conservatives see as "being cancelled by insurance companies and banks." He said some conservatives believe they aren't getting banking services because some of their businesses have been deemed too conservative to get their help. Since the Mar-a-Lago meetings, Schlapp's ACU has launched an effort to push back on corporate enemies. During seperate portions of the Republican National Committee's donor retreat at the nearby Four Seasons over the same weekend, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla ., took aim at corporations, including big tech companies, and how they treat their employees, according to people briefed on the matter. Rubio, according to some of the people, pushed back on corporate executives and seemed to encourage party leaders to better appeal to union workers in the upcoming midterm elections. Union workers are typically considered solid Democratic voters. Rubio in March wrote an op-ed in USA Today lambasting Amazon and praised the efforts by some of their workers to unionize. The e-commerce giant won enough votes to defeat the move by their workers in Alabama to unionize. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told CNBC that conversations he had at the retreat focused, in part, on "concern over bias and growing power of media and social media." Though CEOs and other executives from publicly traded companies don't always come to these events, their absence at the RNC retreat was particularly conspicuous. Leaders from some companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange have given big to the RNC in recent years, such as Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman and Charles Schwab, the chairman of Charles Schwab Corporation. A person familiar with the RNC retreat told CNBC that there was no sign of Schwarzman at the gathering. It's also unclear if Schwab was there. Representatives for Blackstone and Schwab did not return requests for comment. However, that doesn't mean big money donors didn't show up. Many privately said they would support Trump again if he ran for president in 2024. One person said that former Sen. Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, who is married to Intercontinental Exchange CEO Jeffrey Sprecher, attended the retreat as a party financier. As did George M. Drysdale, the chairman and CEO of the Marsman Drysdale Group, Florida based investor Marc Goldman and Jane Timken, the former Ohio GOP chair who is now running for Senate.
President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced that he will nominate Robert Santos for the Director of the Census Bureau. Santos, if confirmed, would become the first person of color to hold the position. Santos, who is Hispanic, would head the agency in charge of the surveying the population every 10 years to determine distribution of funding to states as well as their political representation. "The principles of transparency, scientific independence, and integrity will be key in allowing the Census Bureau to thrive and innovate over the coming decade," Santos wrote in a statement to NPR.	President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced that he will nominate Robert Santos for the Director of the Census Bureau. Santos, if confirmed, would become the first person of color to hold the position. Santos, who is Hispanic, would head the agency in charge of the surveying the population every 10 years to determine distribution of funding to states as well as their political representation. He is an expert in survey sampling, survey design and social science/policy research, with over 40 years of experience, the White House said. Biden's latest pick continues on his campaign pledge to create a diverse administration, one which "looks like America," Biden has stated . Santos currently serves as vice president of the Statistics Methods Group at the Urban Institute, a Washington, DC, nonprofit research organization. In that role he had been a critic of the bureau, co-authoring a 2019 report warning that the 2020 Census could gravely undercount minorities . The Census Bureau became a political football during the Trump administration when then-President Donald Trump and his allies pushed to exclude undocumented immigrants from the count. Trump's Census Bureau Director, Steven Dillingham, resigned in January amid accusations of politicizing the agency that is part of the Commerce Department. The 2020 U.S. Census results have been delayed due to challenges surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as ongoing litigation. It now expects to complete the count on April 30, 2021, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office and "deliver redistricting data to all states by September 30, 2021." Santos did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment, but he said in a statement to NPR , "The principles of transparency, scientific independence, and integrity will be key in allowing the Census Bureau to thrive and innovate over the coming decade." - CNBC's Tucker Higgins contributed to this report.
The U.S. minimum wage has been stagnant since 2009 at $7.25 an hour. The OECD said the United States should also go further in improving labor market conditions.	LONDON — The U.S. should go ahead with a plan to increase its federal minimum wage to help with a more inclusive recovery from the coronavirus crisis, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Wednesday. President Joe Biden wants to increase the minimum pay of federal employees to $15 per hour, and an executive order for doing so could come in a matter of weeks. According to the OECD, this is critical to support low-income earners, who have been more severely impacted by the pandemic. "In several advanced economies, the pandemic and ongoing labour market changes … brought the issue of minimum wages to the fore," the OECD said in its Going For Growth report published Wednesday. "This is particularly the case in the United States, where raising the federal minimum wage is among the top priorities. Recent evidence suggests that increases of the minimum wage up to 59% of the median wage have little negative impact on employment," the Paris-based institution said. "Raising the federal minimum wage would both incentivize participation and help to ameliorate earnings inequalities," it added. The U.S. minimum wage has been $7.25 an hour since 2009. Small business owners have said the plan to increase pay would be a burden at a difficult time. On the other hand, some worker rights' groups have argued that Biden should do more, including step up protections for those with disabilities and better enforce workplace rights to reduce discrimination. The OECD also said that the United States should go further in improving labor market conditions. This would mean supporting workers' mobility, providing more training programs and reducing red tape for people with criminal records looking to obtain occupational licenses. "We need to make our economies more resilient, we need to make them more inclusive," OECD chief economist Laurence Boone told CNBC on Wednesday. She added that it is important to "focus on those people that are left behind." The United States is seen growing at a pace of 6.4% this year, according to forecasts from the International Monetary Fund. This means it is on track to surpass its pre-pandemic GDP levels this year. But new labor market friendly policies could limit the scarring effects of the crisis and lead to more employment.
The Treasury Department will create a new office to oversee coronavirus relief programs. The office will dole out about $420 billion in assistance approved in March as part of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. The IRS will still primarily manage direct payments and the expanded child tax credit, two major relief provisions.	The U.S. Treasury will create a new office to oversee the at times choppy effort to send out coronavirus relief, the department said Wednesday. The Office of Recovery Programs will dole out about $420 billion in assistance approved in March as part of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. The programs include state and local government aid, rental and homeowner relief and small business assistance. The new Treasury initiative will also manage existing aid programs set up as part of the CARES Act and other coronavirus relief legislation passed last year. The Internal Revenue Service will still primarily manage direct payments and the expanded child tax credit, among other major relief provisions. The Treasury Department said the office "will be principally focused on efficiently establishing and administering Treasury's programs to support an equitable and swift recovery" from the pandemic-fueled economic downturn. The Biden administration created the office amid concerns about oversight of the mammoth government spending programs and the efficiency of payments. Republicans have also criticized the fact that some aid programs will not expire for months or more. The Treasury Department did not provide an estimate of how much relief money has gone out so far. Jacob Leibenluft, a former economic advisor in the Obama administration, will lead the new office. He will work with Gene Sperling, who is overseeing the Biden administration's rollout of the $1.9 trillion aid law. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
Gary Gensler will lead the Securities and Exchange Commission after the Senate voted Wednesday to confirm his nomination to head the nation's top financial regulator. Gensler will play a key role enforcing and drafting the rules that govern Wall Street, investors and financial entities. Progressives expect him to look into digital currencies, the GameStop trading mania and how corporate America prioritizes environmental, social and governance issues.	Gary Gensler will lead the Securities and Exchange Commission after the Senate voted 53-45 on Wednesday to confirm his nomination to head the nation's top financial regulator. Gensler, chosen for the role by President Joe Biden , will now play a key part in enforcing and drafting the rules that govern Wall Street, investors and a wide range of other financial entities. Now, with the SEC commissioners possessing a 3-2 Democratic majority, Gensler will likely have a long to-do list after he settles in to his new job. Progressives expect the 63-year-old to follow through on his promises to look into a range of topics, including digital currencies, the GameStop trading mania and how corporate America prioritizes environmental, social and governance issues. Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs executive, is perhaps best known in Washington for his unyielding work at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where he devised the regulatory framework for the multitrillion-dollar derivatives market. Democrats and Republicans alike asked Gensler in March whether he would scrutinize payment for order flow and game-like tactics used by brokerages to entice customers to their platforms. Both subjects received attention on Capitol Hill this year after January's wild trading in GameStop, AMC Entertainment and other stocks . Gensler also noted potential problems with the current structure of payment for order flow, a common practice on Wall Street whereby trading firms, such as Citadel Securities, pay companies to send them their customers' orders for execution. Questioned in March how the SEC should regulate bitcoin and other digital assets, Gensler replied that the responsibility could fall across the government depending on how assets such as bitcoin are classified. One of his earliest and most-anticipated decisions as head of the SEC will be whether to allow the creation of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Sen. Sherrod Brown, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, was quick to offer praise for Gensler following the vote. "Mr. Gensler will lead the SEC at a time when it's become more and more obvious to most people that the stock market is detached from the reality of working families' lives," the Ohio Democrat said in a statement. "Mr. Gensler will bring the SEC's focus back to the people who make this country work and push to ensure that markets are a way for families to save and invest ... not a game for hedge fund managers where workers always lose." Sen. Pat Toomey, the ranking member on the Banking committee, offered an explanation on why he opposed Gensler's nomination. "I'm concerned he will cause the SEC to use its regulatory powers to advance a liberal social agenda focused on issues such as global warming, political spending disclosures, and racial inequality and diversity," the Pennsylvania Republican said in a statement. "Nothing Mr. Gensler said at his hearing—or since—has alleviated my concerns," he added. Toomey in March asked for Gensler's thoughts on Nasdaq's push to increase diversity on corporate boards. Republicans have decried a recent plan submitted by the exchange operator to the SEC that would require the thousands of companies listed on its stock exchange to include women, racial minorities and LGBT individuals on their boards . Gensler replied by touting the benefits of diversity more broadly and among the ranks at the SEC.
The Department of Justice said it will not pursue criminal charges against the police officer who fatally shot a woman participating in the Jan. 6 invasion of the U.S. Capitol. The woman, 35-year-old Ashli Babbitt, was one of five people who died as a result of the invasion of the Capitol by a mob of former President Donald Trump's supporters. An attorney for her family said, "we are not dissuaded from our goal of ultimately vindicating Ashli Babbitt's constitutional rights in the civil arena."	The Department of Justice said Wednesday that it will not pursue criminal charges against the police officer who fatally shot a woman participating in the Jan. 6 pro-Trump invasion of the U.S. Capitol. The family of the woman, 35-year-old Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt, objected to that decision and vowed to pursue civil action. Law enforcement officials "determined that there is insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution" against the U.S. Capitol Police officer, the Justice Department said in a press release . That determination followed a "thorough investigation" that examined video footage, eyewitness statements and physical evidence surrounding the shooting, the DOJ said. The investigation has now been closed, the DOJ said. Babbitt was one of five people who died as a result of the invasion of the Capitol by a mob of former President Donald Trump's supporters. Babbitt was part of the crowd that gained access to a hallway outside the Speaker's Lobby, which leads to the House chamber. She was shot once by an officer as she tried to climb through the broken glass window of a door to the lobby, which had been barricaded from the inside with furniture. Babbitt was shot in the left shoulder and fell backward onto the floor. She was transported to Washington Hospital Center, where she died. Officials with the Metropolitan Police Department's Internal Affairs Division told Babbitt's family earlier Wednesday that no criminal charges would be brought against the officer, who has not been publicly identified. The DOJ's press release said that "the investigation revealed no evidence to establish that, at the time the officer fired a single shot at Ms. Babbitt, the officer did not reasonably believe that it was necessary to do so in self-defense or in defense of the Members of Congress and others evacuating the House Chamber." "Acknowledging the tragic loss of life and offering condolences to Ms. Babbitt's family, the U.S. Attorney's Office and U.S. Department of Justice have therefore closed the investigation into this matter," the press release said. Terrell Roberts, an attorney for Babbitt's family, argued in a press release that the facts of the case support a prosecution. "The actual evidence is this: the officer shot an unarmed woman who was not an immediate threat to him or any Member of Congress," Roberts said. "That is inconsistent with any claim of self-defense or the defense of others, period," Roberts said. "We strongly disagree with the U.S. Attorney's decision. But we are not dissuaded from our goal of ultimately vindicating Ashli Babbitt's constitutional rights in the civil arena." Babbitt was a vocal supporter of Trump. Her family told news outlets after her death that Babbitt had gone to Washington on Jan. 6 to protest Congress' certification of President Joe Biden's Electoral College victory. Trump has never conceded defeat to Biden. Instead, he falsely asserted he won the election and amplified a plethora of baseless voter-fraud conspiracy theories, many of which he continues to spread. Before Congress convened on Jan. 6 to confirm Biden's win, Trump spoke at a rally outside the White House, telling his followers to walk to the Capitol and pressuring Republicans to reject the electoral results. Throngs of Trump supporters walked across the National Mall to the Capitol, where the protest quickly escalated into a riot. Hundreds of people broke through lines of law enforcement officers and stormed the building, forcing lawmakers, as well as Vice President Mike Pence, into hiding. The invasion derailed by several hours Congress' efforts to confirm Biden's victory. Before he left office on Jan. 20, Trump was impeached in the House on an article of inciting an insurrection. He was acquitted in the Senate.
A new report says that in 2020, more than $13 billion in coronavirus government contracts went to corporations that heavily lobbied the Trump administration. Though the report notes there is no indication that these companies inappropriately received government contracts, the study says the "heavy lobbying effort and occasional close personal ties between contract recipients and government decision makers raises questions." Palantir Technologies and Regeneron, both with ties to former President Donald Trump, are among companies cited in the study.	Corporations that received millions of dollars in Covid-related government contracts under the Trump administration also initiated large-scale lobbying campaigns, according to a new report. The study , first shared with CNBC, was conducted by the Center for Responsive Politics and Public Citizen. The report says that in 2020, out of the more than $36 billion companies saw in coronavirus government contracts, over $13 billion was given to corporations that heavily lobbied the Trump administration. On Covid and other lobbying issues, companies that received government contracts linked to the coronavirus pandemic combined to spend $372 million on lobbying campaigns in 2020. That's just under the amount they spent in 2019. Palantir Technologies is among companies cited in the study. The software company was co-founded by Peter Thiel, an ally of former President Donald Trump . Though the report notes there is no indication that these companies inappropriately received government contracts, the study says the "heavy lobbying effort and occasional close personal ties between contract recipients and government decision makers raises questions." The research does not include any data showing the lobbying coincided with the timing of when these contracts were received. It also acknowledges that many of the products created by these companies were helpful to the government and the public at large. "Just 2 percent of all COVID contractors (142 in total) disclosed that they lobbied the Trump White House and/or the agency that awarded them a contract on issues directly related to the pandemic. These 2 percent of contractors received 37 percent – $13.4 billion – of all the contract money awarded," the report notes. The report mentions the companies that launched extensive lobbying campaigns and received government contracts targeted the Trump administration, including former Vice President Mike Pence's office. Pence was the chair of the coronavirus task force. Some of these companies were previously awarded government contracts under other administrations. "Of the 142 companies that lobbied either the White House or their awarding agency on COVID issues, 107 lobbied the White House. More than a quarter of the 107 had not previously lobbied the Trump White House," the study says. The companies mentioned in this story did not return requests for comment. Palantir received Covid government contracts worth more than $40 million, much of which came from Health and Human Services. The study notes that some of the contract money paid to Palantir was to develop software called Tiberius, which is being used to help coordinate the distribution of coronavirus vaccines. The report says Palantir spent more than $2 million on lobbying in 2020, including in the third quarter of that year in which it focused on "education regarding Palantir commercial software, including efforts for the COVID-19 response; highlight commercial benefits of software solutions," the lobbying report says. The filing notes that Palantir, through the lobbying firm it hired, engaged with members of Congress and HHS leaders. Palantir spent nearly $1 million more on lobbying in 2020 than it spent in 2019, according to the study. Regeneron is another company listed as getting a contract while also lobbying government officials. The pharmaceutical giant's Covid antibody treatment was used by Trump himself. Regeneron, the study says, received Covid-related government contracts from HHS worth more than $145 million for biomedical and research development. The company spent $1.5 million on lobbying in 2020, $430,000 more than in 2019, the study shows. In the first quarter of 2020, Regeneron lobbied HHS, the Food and Drug Administration, the White House Office and Pence's office on "Biodefense issues relating to biopharmaceutical manufacturers; pandemic readiness and response." Fitbit, a fitness watch maker, is listed in the report. It notes that the company received $900,000 in Covid government contracts from the Department of Veteran Affairs "for identifying risks with digital health technologies." It spent $800,000 on lobbying in 2020, a jump of 60% compared with the previous year. In the third quarter of 2020, Fitbit, through a lobbying firm it retained, engaged with members of Congress, HHS and the Executive Office of the President, to "educate policymakers about company initiatives on COVID-19 and benefits of wearable fitness technology; discuss use of aggregated data for public health monitoring," according to the lobbying report.
The House coronavirus subcommittee will hear Thursday from three top Biden administration health officials about the United States' vaccination efforts. The hearing comes two days after dozens of states abruptly stopped administering Johnson & Johnson's single-dose Covid vaccine following reports of six cases of women who developed a rare blood-clotting disorder. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and top Biden administration health official David Kessler are set to speak. The hearing is scheduled to begin Thursday at 10:30 a.m. ET.	The House coronavirus subcommittee will hear Thursday from three top Biden administration health officials about the United States' efforts to ramp up vaccinations as Covid cases, including those from dangerous variants , are on the rise . The hearing, which will also focus on the enduring need for people to wear masks and follow social distancing measures, is scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m. ET. It will be livestreamed . The event comes two days after dozens of states abruptly stopped administering  Johnson & Johnson 's single-dose Covid vaccine in response to the Food and Drug Administration's recommendation that those shots be paused while it investigates cases of women who developed a rare blood-clotting disorder. Some fear that recommendation , which was issued in response to six reported blood-clot cases out of nearly 7 million J&J doses administered, could hinder the global campaign to inoculate the world out of the pandemic . The Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, led by House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., is set to hear from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, as well as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. David Kessler, a top Covid response official in President Joe Biden 's Department of Health and Human Services, is also on the witness list. While the U.S. is vaccinating more people than ever, Covid cases are on the rise in more than half of its states . More than 71,000 cases per day were tallied on average in the past week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University . "It's almost a race between getting people vaccinated and this surge that seems to want to increase," Fauci said Wednesday on CNN . The emergence of Covid variants — such as B 1.1.7, which has recently swarmed Michigan and is now the most common strain in the U.S . — has health officials urging Americans to keep taking health precautions, despite the accelerating vaccination efforts . Meanwhile, experts say Johnson & Johnson's recent vaccine woes could fuel vaccine skepticism. In their push for all eligible people in the U.S. to get vaccinated for Covid, officials have stressed that all available options — from Pfizer - BioNTech , Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — are safe and effective. All three have been authorized for emergency use by the FDA. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna require two separate doses, to be administered three to four weeks apart. But the six cases of women who developed the rare blood clots pushed the FDA to recommend pausing J&J's shot "out of an abundance of caution." All of the women developed the condition within about two weeks of inoculation, health officials told reporters Tuesday. One of the women died. "I think it will have an effect on hesitancy, period. Whether it should or not is a different matter," Dr. Jeffrey Kahn, director of the Berman Institute of Bioethics at Johns Hopkins University, told CNBC. Since Johnson & Johnson's vaccine involves only one dose, experts say the pause could also reduce vaccine access for some communities. "This vaccine was being biased to use in more austere settings, places where you couldn't deliver two doses, you wanted to deliver one dose and be done with the vaccination schedule," Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who sits on Pfizer's board, told CNBC on Tuesday. — The Associated Press contributed to this report. Disclosure: Scott Gottlieb is a CNBC contributor and is a member of the boards of Pfizer, genetic testing start-up Tempus, health-care tech company Aetion Inc. and biotech company Illumina . He also serves as co-chair of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings ′ and Royal Caribbean 's "Healthy Sail Panel."
Former Vice President Mike Pence underwent surgery to have a pacemaker implanted after experiencing "symptoms associated with a slow heart rate," according to a statement from his office. The "routine surgery" was successfully performed Wednesday, the statement said. Pence is "expected to fully recover and return to normal activity in the coming days," it said.	Former Vice President Mike Pence underwent surgery to have a pacemaker implanted after experiencing "symptoms associated with a slow heart rate," his office said Thursday, NBC News reported. The "routine surgery" was successfully performed Wednesday, according to the statement from Pence's office, which said the 61-year-old former vice president is "expected to fully recover and return to normal activity in the coming days." The statement noted that Pence's medical history included a diagnosis of asymptomatic left bundle branch block. He felt symptoms over the past two weeks and consulted with his doctors before undergoing the procedure at Inova Fairfax Medical Campus in Falls Church, Virginia, the statement said. "I am grateful for the swift professionalism and care of the outstanding doctors, nurses and staff at Inova Heart and Vascular Institute, including Dr. Brett Atwater and Dr. Behnam Tehrani," Pence said in the statement. "I also appreciate the consultation of my longtime Indiana physicians, Dr. Michael Busk and Dr. Charles Taliercio at Ascension St. Vincent. My family has been truly blessed by the work of these dedicated healthcare professionals," Pence said. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., tweeted a message of support to Pence later Thursday. Pence is widely rumored to be laying the groundwork for a potential presidential run in 2024. But a candidate's health and medical history can often factor significantly into a political campaign. For example, former President Donald Trump's health came under significant scrutiny in the final months of his reelection bid, when he was hospitalized with the coronavirus. Critics had already accused Trump, who is overweight and known to have a poor diet, of being deceptive about his medical records . Campaigns themselves can also be physically and mentally exhausting. In 2016, for instance, then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's near-fainting episode at a Sept. 11 anniversary ceremony dominated headlines. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had a heart attack in October 2019 during his run for president. He returned to the campaign trail later that month.
President Biden's administration on Thursday announced a raft of new sanctions against Moscow over 2020 election interference and a huge cyberattack, among other transgressions. "The latest round of U.S. sanctions was a mostly symbolic exercise," Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC on Friday. Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at Moscow-based BCS Global Markets, told CNBC on Friday that some investors were relieved by the removal of uncertainty and fairly modest sanctions, which reduced the overall level of Russia-related investment risks.	New U.S. sanctions on Russia are "mostly symbolic" and will have minimal impact on markets and the macroeconomic outlook, economists have suggested. President Biden's administration on Thursday announced a raft of new sanctions against Moscow over 2020 election interference, a huge cyberattack on U.S. government and corporate networks, illegal annexation and occupation of Ukraine's Crimea, and human rights abuses. Sanctions targeted 16 entities and 16 individuals accused of attempting to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election, along with five individuals and three entities linked to the Crimea annexation, and expelled 10 Russian diplomats from the U.S. Washington also imposed sanctions on newly-issued Russian sovereign debt, which caused a slight sell-off in the Russian ruble and sovereign bonds on Thursday. The move prevents U.S. financial institutions from participating in the primary market for ruble and non-ruble denominated debt after June 14. However, economists do not foresee any tangible fallout from the sanctions in their current form. "The latest round of U.S. sanctions was a mostly symbolic exercise," Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC on Friday. "Sanctions on Russian individuals and companies are irrelevant, as these people and firms have no ties to the US and probably no intention to ever use the U.S. dollar or to have bank accounts in the U.S." Demarais added that the sanctions on sovereign debt are less stringent than the initial market reaction would suggest, since they only target the primary debt market and can therefore "easily be circumvented via the secondary market." The primary market in this instance refers to Russian debt securities created and offered to the public for the first time, while the secondary market is where those securities are traded among investors. "This policy choice means that the U.S. administration was careful to avoid hurting U.S. investors, who hold billions in Russian sovereign debt," Demarais said. Notably, U.S. officials accompanied the sanctions with a series of statements voicing desire to improve bilateral relations with Moscow. The sanctions effectively draw a line under a period of investors waiting and guessing as to their timing and extent. Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at Moscow-based BCS Global Markets, told CNBC on Friday that some investors were relieved by the removal of uncertainty and fairly modest sanctions, which reduced the overall level of Russia-related investment risks. Tikhomirov said the sovereign debt ban was the most significant of the new measures, but its impact was still limited. "However, given the current state of Russia's budget (in 1Q21 the budget was in surplus), low level of sovereign debt, conservative fiscal policy and high volume of accumulated reserves the ban on new debt purchases is unlikely to have significant implications for the state of Russia's finances or for the economy at large," he said. Liam Peach, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, agreed that the fallout will be limited unless the sanctions are extended to all sovereign debt, or Russia launches aggressive retaliation. Capital Economics estimates that the Russian government will issue 2.5 trillion rubles of bonds in 2021, equivalent to 2.7% of its GDP, to finance its deficit and roll over maturing debt. However, Peach anticipates that almost all debt will be issued in rubles and bought by Russian banks, limiting the impact of sanctions on new issuances. While past sanctions have tended to result in a prolonged premium on Russia's dollar bonds and currency, the macro impact has been fairly limited, Peach highlighted in a research note Thursday. "This provides an anchor, but of course the impact will depend on what scale non-residents sell their holdings of outstanding debt," he said. "Russian retaliation could consist of counter-sanctions or increased tensions with Ukraine but the key point is that the trend towards increased isolation will only grow further," Peach noted. Tikhomirov said Russian investors do not expect retaliation by way of economic or financial measures, and therefore remain relatively sanguine about the implications on markets and the economy. "That said, the prime risk in this area is mainly political: as Russia is likely to retaliate by political moves these potentially could result in a further escalation in Russia-West relations, which, in turn, could trigger counteraction from the U.S. and its allies," he said. "Such a scenario cannot but concern many investors, although hopes remain that Moscow will take the U.S. offer and will also make moves aimed at improving relations with the U.S. and the West in general." Economists broadly expect the Central Bank of Russia to hike interest rates next week. Peach projected that should the ruble come under significant pressure and the CBR develops worries about the inflation outlook, more aggressive monetary tightening can be expected. Capital Economics now expects a 50 basis point hike to 5%. Meanwhile Tikhomirov anticipates a 25 basis point hike to 4.75% and a possible additional 25-50bp hike later in the year, as policymakers track an acceleration in inflationary pressures rather than reacting to sanctions.
The Biden administration will allocate $1.7 billion toward tracking highly infectious coronavirus variants. The funds will be used to help improve the detection, monitoring and mitigation of "new and potentially dangerous strains" of the virus. Variants now comprise about half of all U.S. Covid cases, and the mutations can be up to 70% more transmissible than the original strain, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said.	The Biden administration announced Friday it will allocate $1.7 billion toward tracking the highly infectious coronavirus variants that now pose a major threat to the United States' fight against the pandemic. The funds, taken from the $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan signed into law last month, will be used to help improve the detection, monitoring and mitigation of "new and potentially dangerous strains," the White House said in a press release. The Covid variants now comprise about half of all cases in the U.S., according to the White House. The mutations can be up to 70% more transmissible than the original strain, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said. Their continued spread "makes the race to stop the transmission even more challenging and threatens to overwhelm our health-care system again in parts of this country," Walensky said at a press briefing. She noted that B.1.1.7, the variant originally identified in the United Kingdom, accounted for 44% of U.S. Covid circulation during the week of March 27. The spread of variants is contributing to a "very concerning" rise in cases, hospitalizations and emergency room visits, Walensky said. Average daily deaths have increased for the third day in a row to more than 700, she said. The White House said $1 billion of the administration's latest coronavirus investment will be used to help the CDC and other health officials expand genomic sequencing, which will help them identify mutations. "The emergence of variants underscores the critical need for rapid and ongoing genomic surveillance," Walensky said. The White House said $400 million of the remaining funds "will fuel cutting-edge research into genomic epidemiology" through the establishment of six "centers of excellence" that will form partnerships between health departments and academic institutions. The final $300 million will go toward strengthening so-called bioinformatics infrastructure, "creating a unified system for sharing and analyzing sequence data in a way that protects privacy but allows more informed decisionmaking," the White House said. An initial $240 million tranche of funding will be disbursed to U.S. states and territories in early May, with California, Texas and Florida receiving the largest amounts. The White House said more of the money will be invested over a period of several years. Health experts continue to push Americans to get vaccinated for Covid. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said Thursday in a congressional hearing that B.1.1.7 is "very well covered by the vaccines that we are using," and that even with other variants, "if the vaccination doesn't protect against initial infection, it protects against severe disease." "We are in a race between vaccinating as many people as quickly and as expeditiously as we possibly can, and the threat of the resurgence of viruses in our country," Fauci said.
President Joe Biden notified Congress in February that he would increase the number of refugees allowed to enter the country from 15,000 to 62,500 in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. Earlier Friday, NBC News reported that Biden will not increase the number of refugees allowed to enter the U.S. this year, according to a senior administration official. Democrats on Friday slammed Biden for keeping in place this year the cap on refugees allowed to enter the U.S. set by the Trump administration. Later Friday afternoon, in an apparent response to the outpouring of criticism, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said "we expect the president to set a final, increased refugee cap for the remainder of this fiscal year by May 15." However, Psaki said the president is unlikely to meet his goal of 62,500.	Democrats on Friday slammed President Joe Biden for keeping in place this year the cap on refugees allowed to enter the United States set by the Trump administration. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said it was "unacceptable and unconscionable that the Biden administration is not immediately repealing Donald Trump's harmful, xenophobic, and racist refugee cap that cruelly restricts refugee admissions to a historically low level." "After four painful years of fighting Trump's all-out draconian assault on immigrants, President Biden promised to restore America as a beacon of hope and committed to increasing our refugee resettlement numbers. By failing to sign an Emergency Presidential Determination to lift Trump's historically low refugee cap, President Biden has broken his promise to restore our humanity," Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said. "We cannot turn our back on refugees around the world, including hundreds of refugees who have already been cleared for resettlement, have sold their belongings, and are ready to board flights." Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., called the move "unacceptable." "These refugees can wait years for their chance and go through extensive vetting. Thirty-five thousand are ready. Facing the greatest refugee crisis in our time there is no reason to limit the number to 15,000. Say it ain't so, President Joe," Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., the chairman of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also blasted Biden over the move. "By failing to issue a revised Determination, the White House has not only stymied the number of refugees permitted entrance into the United States, but also it has prevented the Department of State from admitting vetted refugees currently waiting in the system who do not fit into the unprecedentedly narrow refugee categories designated by the Trump administration," he said in a statement. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who fled Somalia when she was a child and spent years in a refugee camp in Kenya before arriving in the U.S., tweeted that, "As a refugee, I know finding a home is a matter of life or death for children around the world." "It is shameful that @POTUS is reneging on a key promise to welcome refugees," she said. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., tweeted he was "deeply disappointed by today's decision to maintain Trump's lowest refugee admissions target," while Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who chairs the House Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee, tweeted there was "no justification for this historically low refugee target." "It undoes what the Admin agreed to in their consultation with me in February," she added. Former Texas Democratic congressman and 2020 presidential candidate Julián Castro said, "this is a bad decision." "Trump gutted our refugee program, a cornerstone of our global leadership and values. His polices can't be the default we carry on—especially for the sake of "optics," he said in a tweet. Earlier Friday, NBC News reported that Biden will not increase the number of refugees allowed to enter the U.S. this year, according to a senior administration official, breaking a prior promise to raise the cap from the historically-low level set by the Trump administration. Biden notified Congress in February that he would increase the number of refugees allowed to enter the country from 15,000 to 62,500 in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, upping it to 125,000 for the following year. But he never signed the presidential determination that would actually raise the cap, effectively keeping the cap at Trump-era levels. Such paperwork is usually signed shortly after a policy announcement. Biden leaving the cap highlights the pressure on his administration to address the surge of migrants , many of them unaccompanied children, arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border seeking asylum. Republicans have criticized Biden for the situation, painting his administration as weak on border security. Later Friday afternoon, in an apparent response to the outpouring of criticism, W hite House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement that Biden's "directive today has been the subject of some confusion," and said that "we expect the president to set a final, increased refugee cap for the remainder of this fiscal year by May 15." Meanwhile, America's Voice, a progressive immigration reform proponent, said in a statement earlier that, "This is bad policy and bad politics." "As a policy matter, there is no valid policy reason to maintain the shockingly low refugee cap. As a political matter, President Biden will alienate a lot of his supporters by failing to turn the page on President Trump's racism, xenophobia and scapegoating of immigrants and refugees," the group said.
One year after the Covid-19 pandemic hit, new forms of government aid are helping to keep Americans afloat. The federal government's moves could inform its response should another crisis hit. Here's what experts hope to see.	Millions of Americans have received some form of financial support from the government to help them get through the Covid-19 pandemic. The coronavirus has prompted the federal government to send three sets of stimulus checks, increase federal unemployment benefits and extend the duration and eligibility of those benefits, provide forgivable loans to small businesses and implement new tax credits for families. It started with the CARES Act that Congress approved in March 2020, and continued with follow-up legislation in December and American Rescue Plan Act that was put through in March. More from Personal Finance: New batch of $1,400 stimulus checks includes payments to veterans How Americans are using their $1,400 stimulus checks Why your stimulus checks was less than expected One year into the crisis, the question now is how long some of those tools will stay, or how soon similar programs could kick in if another crisis were to occur. "It's not crazy to suggest taking some of the pieces of the CARES Act and recognizing that these might be useful to have on the books in the future," said Richard Prisinzano, director of policy analysis at the Penn Wharton Budget Model at the University of Pennsylvania. More financial help will depend on what lawmakers can agree on. But based on the past year, experts have some ideas about what would make sense for American families. The American Rescue Plan Act strengthened the jobless benefits available to Americans through September. That includes an extra $300 per week in federal unemployment benefits. In addition, the law increases the number of weeks those benefits are available and makes the first $10,200 of income from those checks exempt from federal income taxes. Now, some new proposals, including one by Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Michael Bennett of Colorado, seek to make those kinds of enhancements permanent. The Economic Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, is also collaborating with other researchers to publish a paper on this kind of strategy, according to research director Josh Bivens. Generally, the idea would be that once the unemployment rate starts to rise — to anywhere from 5% to 8%, for example — the generosity of unemployment benefits would automatically increase, along with the length of time people could collect those jobless checks. To further strengthen the system, benefits should also be made available to include non-traditional gig workers, as well as those who are looking to enter the labor force, such as stay at home parents or recently graduated college students, Bivens said. However, the political process could derail this expansion, according to Bivens. Yet another obstacle is finding the money to upgrade states' unemployment infrastructure, particularly with regard to technology, he said. Ultimately, the challenge is to strike a balance between providing enough money for people when they are without work, but not so generous that they are discouraged from re-entering the labor force. "I would argue in the U.S. we have erred way too much on the 'keep it stingy' part," Bivens said. "We have a lot of room to make [unemployment pay] a lot more generous, and yet not stop people from looking for jobs." The American Rescue Plan Act helped steady the Paycheck Protection Program, a lending process aimed at keeping small businesses afloat, which has disbursed $755 billion in loans to date. The program was initially established through the CARES Act. PPP loans provide incentives for small businesses to maintain workers on their payrolls. In some cases, the loans may qualify for forgiveness. Going forward, the government could opt to continue this kind of lending as a sort of unemployment insurance for businesses, according to Penn's Prisinzano. "There's no reason why you couldn't have those types of loans available all the time," he said. The Small Business Administration's lending program kind of works like this already. However, there are advantages to providing PPP loans indefinitely, where the money borrowed could be forgivable in certain circumstances, such as if a business can demonstrate that it is profitable. It could also help businesses that have been hurt by forces beyond their control, such as a recession or natural disaster like a hurricane, Prisinzano said. The funds could enable affected businesses to keep employees on their books and also keep the lights on by paying their electric and other utility bills. Americans have received about $850 billion through the three stimulus checks sent out in the past year. Now, there is a chorus from some advocates who are calling for additional direct payments to Americans. This week, the Economic Security Project released a report that argued more stimulus checks are needed. "We need at least one more check," said Adam Ruben, campaign director at the Economic Security Project. Additional direct payments would help Americans who are continuing to struggle with high unemployment, particularly low-income and minority individuals and families, the report argued. Some Democratic lawmakers have expressed their support for such initiatives. Last month, a group of 21 Senators wrote a letter to President Joe Biden that called for "recurring direct payments and automatic unemployment insurance extensions tied to economic conditions." Additional stimulus checks would help families who do not have access to unemployment checks, they said. Such a policy is also popular with Americans. A January Data for Progress poll found that 65% of Americans are in favor of $2,000 monthly checks for the duration of the pandemic. Yet experts are skeptical additional checks will get enough support from lawmakers to trigger additional payments at this time. "I don't think we're going to see a lot of more pure checks," Prisinzano said. "I just think the appetite isn't there on both sides of the aisle." Many parents will see additional cash coming their way after the American Rescue Plan Act expanded the child tax credit. While those changes are only in effect for one year, experts expect there will be efforts to make them permanent. The payments will go to $3,600, from $2,000, per child under 6, and to $3,000 per child up to age 17. What's more, the payments may be issued monthly, starting in July, rather than requiring families waiting until they file their taxes next year before they see the money. Those checks are slated to be up to $300 per month per child under 6, and up to $250 per month per child up to 17. The plan provides payments to almost every family with a child, according to Bivens. "I would love to see that become a permanent part of the economy, recession or not," he said.
White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday he believes the U.S. will likely resume use of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine with a warning or restriction attached. Health regulators asked states on Tuesday to temporarily halt J&J's single-dose shot after reports of six cases of rare brain blood clots in women. Fauci said he anticipates a decision on the J&J vaccine as soon as Friday, when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory panel meets to discuss resumption.	White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday he believes the U.S. will likely resume use of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine with a warning or restriction attached. Health regulators asked states on Tuesday to temporarily halt J&J's single-dose shot after reports of six cases of rare brain blood clots in women out of roughly 7 million people who received the vaccine in the U.S. The cases occurred in women ages 18 to 48 who developed symptoms six to 13 days after receiving the shot. The Food and Drug Administration said the recommendation to pause the vaccine was "out of an abundance of caution." Fauci said he anticipates a decision on the J&J vaccine as soon as Friday, when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory panel meets to discuss resumption. "My estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form," Fauci said during an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press." "I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don't think that's going to happen. I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment." "I don't think it's just going to go back and say, 'Okay, everything's fine. Go right back.' I think it'll likely say, 'Okay, we're going to use it, but be careful under these certain circumstances,'" Fauci continued. Roughly 5% of vaccine supply in the U.S. is sidelined due to the pause on the J&J shot. It's unclear how the pause will affect the company's goal to deliver 100 million doses across the country by the end of May. White House Covid czar Jeff Zients has said the halt would not have a significant impact on the U.S. vaccination program , which is distributing enough Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to continue the current pace of roughly 3 million shots each day. The country is averaging 3.3 million daily vaccine doses reported administered over the past week, and 3 million when counting just Pfizer and Moderna. Only roughly 7.8 million of the 202 million total shots given in the U.S. have been from J&J, according to CDC data. "You don't want to jump ahead of yourself and decide you know the total spectrum of this, which is one of the reasons why they paused and why hopefully by Friday we'll know that," Fauci said during an interview on CBS' "Face the Nation." — CNBC's Nate Rattner contributed reporting
Half of all U.S. adults have now received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 129 million people ages 18 and older have received at least one shot, or 50.4% of the total adult population. More than 83 million adults, or 32.5% of the total adult population, are fully vaccinated with one of the three vaccines approved in the U.S.	Half of all U.S. adults have now received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, marking a major milestone in the country's largest vaccine campaign. More than 129 million people ages 18 and older have received at least one shot, or 50.4% of the total adult population, according to the CDC. More than 83 million adults, or 32.5% of the total adult population, are fully vaccinated with one of the three vaccines approved in the U.S. The milestone comes one day after the global death toll from the virus topped 3 million people, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University, with global deaths averaging about 12,000 each day. In the U.S., the rate of daily new Covid-19 cases nationwide remains high. The country is reporting about 68,000 new infections each day on average. CDC data shows an average of 3.3 million daily vaccine doses reported administered in the past week. White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients has said the pause in Johnson & Johnson vaccinations, which occurred after reports of six cases of rare brain blood clots, would not slow down the vaccine campaign since the country has enough supply of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

Biden praised the verdict in the high-profile murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Chauvin was convicted on charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. All three charges carry lengthy prison sentences. Chauvin pressed his knee into the neck of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, for more than nine minutes during an arrest. Floyd repeatedly told police officers that he could not breathe before ultimately taking his last breath against the pavement.	WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris praised Tuesday's guilty verdict in the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin as a step forward in the fight against systemic racism,  but they stressed that more work remains to be done. "Today's verdict is a step forward," Biden said in a Tuesday evening address to the nation. "But it's not enough, we can't stop here. In order to deliver real change and reform, we can and we must do more to reduce the likelihood that a tragedy like this will ever occur again." Chauvin was accused of killing George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, by kneeling on his neck for about nine minutes. The former officer's conduct last May, which was captured on video, set off a nationwide firestorm of protests and unrest against police brutality and racism. Chauvin, who is white, was charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The 12-member jury on Tuesday afternoon found Chauvin guilty on all counts . All three charges carry lengthy prison sentences. "Because of smartphones so many Americans have now seen the racial injustice that Black American's have known for generations," Harris said alongside Biden. "We are all part of George Floyd's legacy and our job is to honor it and honor him," Harris added. "Let that be his legacy," Biden said, "A legacy of peace, not violence, of justice. Peaceful expressions of that legacy are inevitable and appropriate. But violent protest is not. And there are those who will seek to exploit the raw emotions of the moment, agitators and extremists who have no interest in social justice, who seek to carry out violence, to destroy property, fan the flames of hate and division, who will do everything in their power to stop this country's march toward racial justice. We can't let them succeed. "This is the time for this country to come together, to unite as Americans. There can never be any safe harbor for hate in America," Biden added. After reading the verdict, the judge said that sentencing would take place in eight weeks. Chauvin was handcuffed and escorted out of the courtroom. A trial for three of the other officers involved in Floyd's arrest, Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng, and Tou Thao, is set to begin in August.

Former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said President Joe Biden's plans to bolster the U.S. economy could help the country to compete with China's massive Belt and Road Initiative. Biden has held meetings with Democratic and Republican members of Congress to discuss his proposed $2 trillion infrastructure and economic recovery. Despite their differences, Lew said the U.S. and China could work together an areas such as climate change, health care, and challenges with Iran and North Korea.	President Joe Biden's plans to bolster the U.S. economy will help the country compete with China's massive Belt and Road Initiative, former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said on Wednesday. The Belt and Road Initiative is  China's ambitious program to build physical and digital infrastructure that connects hundreds of countries from Asia to the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Many critics consider it Chinese President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy to expand his country's global influence. Lew, who was Treasury secretary from 2013 to 2017 under former President Barack Obama , pointed out that China's Belt and Road Initiative has gained traction in the last few years. At the same time, the U.S. under former President Donald Trump retreated from the world stage, he said. "The challenge we have is to look at our domestic challenges and to look at the places where we are very strong and should be stronger," Lew told CNBC's " Squawk Box Asia ." He added that the U.S. is strong in technology and innovation, education, and remaining open to talent from around the world. "We then look ahead to the challenges of the future ... we have to engage in the world, we have to engage with other countries, working together. And you can't say we're not going to be there and then object when someone else shows up," said Lew. Lew's comments came as Biden has held meetings with Democratic and Republican members of Congress to discuss his proposed $2 trillion infrastructure and economic recovery package. The plan aims to rebuild U.S. infrastructure including roads, broadband and utilities, as well as invest in jobs training and research and development. U.S.-China relations have remained rocky since Biden was inaugurated in January. The two countries have clashed on issues ranging from the autonomy of Hong Kong to alleged human rights abuses in China's northwestern region of Xinjiang. Despite their differences, Lew said there are many areas where the U.S. and China can work together. Those areas include climate change, health care and challenges with Iran and North Korea, said the former Treasury secretary. "I think it's a mistake to be on a path where either side is looking for confrontation. It's a mistake to deny that differences exist and there's a need to engage, making differences clear, but also to look for areas where we can work together," Lew said. "I'm hoping that things like the conversations on climate are the beginning of an opening for discussions between our two countries," he added. Chinese state media said Wednesday that Xi will give a speech on Thursday via video conference at the global leaders climate summit hosted by Biden. Many also expect the leaders of the world's two largest economies — and the largest carbon polluters — to have their first meeting on the sidelines of the summit. — CNBC's Jacob Pramuk and Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.
Student loan forgiveness has never seemed likelier to happen, but experts caution borrowers against getting their hopes up. Still, there are some smart moves people can take while Washington debates the matter.	Student debt can impact so many aspects of a person's life, from the careers they pursue to if and when they're able to purchase a home . So it's no wonder that a lot of people feel stuck in limbo as President Joe Biden and other elected officials debate the subject of student loan forgiveness. CNBC has received hundreds of emails from borrowers with questions about just how likely a jubilee is, who would qualify for it and when it might happen. Here are some answers, based on what we know right now. The odds of student loan borrowers getting their balances reduced or eliminated have never been greater. President Biden has said he supports cancelling $10,000 per borrower, and now he's asked his education secretary to prepare a report on his legal authority to wipe out as much as $50,000 for all. That being said, "until legislation is signed into law, you can't count on anything," according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. More from Personal Finance: Here's where Americans are planning to go this summer 38% of Americans would give up sex to travel again Vacations may bounce back this year Currently, there are pending reports from the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on whether the president has the legal authority to implement loan forgiveness through executive action, Kantrowitz said. It's still unclear when the findings will be published. In the meantime, he added, "borrowers should not take any precipitous action in anticipation of loan forgiveness." If Biden decides to go ahead and forgive the loans through executive action, in theory borrowers could see their balances reduced or eliminated pretty quickly. But such a move may be met by court challenges, which could lead to delays. Still, we may have a better idea of what will happen this summer. "If Biden decides he can do it via executive order, I expect we'll hear about it by June or July," said Betsy Mayotte, the president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors. If the White House opts to leave student loan forgiveness to Congress, Democrats would likely use the budget reconciliation process to get it done. That's because that process allows them to pass legislation with a simple majority, which is all they have. Other bills typically must garner 60 votes to advance, thanks to Senate procedural rules. Republicans are largely hostile toward the idea of a student debt jubilee. The next budget reconciliation process will likely be in the fall. At the moment, the main point of contention among student loan forgiveness proponents is over how much debt should be scrapped: $10,000 or $50,000? If all federal student loan borrowers got $10,000 of their debt forgiven, the outstanding education debt in the country would fall to around $1.3 trillion, from $1.7 trillion, according to Kantrowitz. And roughly one-third of federal student loan borrowers, or 15 million people, would see their balances reset to zero. Canceling $50,000 for all borrowers, on the other hand, would shrink the country's outstanding student loan debt balance to $700 billion, from $1.7 trillion. Meanwhile, the debt for 80% of federal student loan borrowers, or 36 million people, would be gone entirely. Even under that more generous plan, not everyone would be entirely happy. One-fifth of federal student loan borrowers owe more than $50,000, and around 7% of borrowers owe more than six-figures. Most federal student loan borrowers don't have to pay their bills until October, and during that time interest is suspended. Since $10,000 in student loan forgiveness is the proposal most likely to turn into reality, Mayotte said she sees nothing wrong with people who owe under that amount redirecting their usual payments to savings, "earning a little interest on them, then seeing which way the wind is blowing come August." "If it looks like we're no closer to forgiveness, pay the funds then," she said. Even if you owe more than $10,000, it can still be wise to take advantage of the government's pause on student loan payments. You can use the extra cash to wipe out high-interest credit card debt, for example, or to build up your emergency savings. There are some smart moves you can take in anticipation of student loan forgiveness, experts say. Millions of people who took out student loans before 2010 under the Federal Family Education Loans program have been excluded from the government's offer to pause their payments without interest accruing. There's now some concern these borrowers could also be left out of any student loan forgiveness. As a result, these borrowers might want to consolidate their FFEL loans into the main Direct Loan program, which will qualify for the forgiveness, Kantrowitz said. The main downside of doing so is that your repayment timeline will be reset; so, if you're near the end, it may not make sense. Meanwhile, borrowers thinking about refinancing their federal student loans into private loans for a lower interest rate may want to wait, Kantrowitz said. For one, the interest rate on most federal student loans is 0% for another five months. What's more, "they will feel foolish if they refinance only to have the federal government announce loan forgiveness," Kantrowitz said. "When it comes to private student loans, it seems highly unlikely that they would be included in the forgiveness plan," said Elaine Rubin, senior contributor and communications specialist at Edvisors . Student loan forgiveness is now tax-free, thanks to a provision included in the $1.9 trillion federal coronavirus stimulus package that became law in March. Formerly, any student loan debt canceled by the government was considered taxable and levied at the borrower's normal income tax rate. According to a rough estimate by Kantrowitz, $10,000 in cancellation would have triggered an extra $2,000 in taxes for the average borrower. If $50,000 per borrower was canceled, the average person would have to write the IRS a check for $10,000. Borrowers would now be off the hook from these bills.
President Joe Biden is expected to raise long-term capital-gains tax for the wealthiest Americans to 43.4%, including a surtax. That would be higher than the top federal tax rate on wage income. That tax rate would apply to returns on assets held in taxable accounts and sold after more than a year. There are still many unknowns, and investors shouldn't necessarily react by selling, financial experts say.	President Joe Biden is expected to propose doubling the tax rate wealthy Americans pay on investment returns when they sell stocks and other assets. But investors shouldn't necessarily rush for the exits, according to financial experts. Under Biden's proposal, the federal capital-gains tax rate would be as high as 43.4% (including an existing Medicare surcharge), according to a Bloomberg report . "Capital gains would be the highest-tax income we have," according to Leon LaBrecque, an accountant and certified financial planner at Sequoia Financial Group, based in Troy, Michigan. Investors currently pay a 23.8% top rate on long-term capital gains. That includes a 20% capital-gains tax on assets held in taxable accounts for more than a year. It also includes the 3.8% surtax on net investment income, which was created by the Affordable Care Act to fund Medicare expansion. Under current law, long-term capital gains are taxed favorably with respect to wages. The wealthy pay a top 37% rate on wage income, for example. The White House plan would instead tax capital gains as ordinary income, at a top proposed rate of 39.6%. It would apply to those with more than $1 million in annual income, according to Bloomberg. (Short-term capital gains, or those held a year or less, are already taxed as ordinary income under current law.) The Biden plan would also keep the Medicare surtax in place — creating a top long-term capital-gains rate of 43.4%, according to Bloomberg. The top long-term capital-gains rate applies to single taxpayers with more than $445,850 of income this year. (It kicks in above $501,600 for married couples filing a joint tax return.) The Medicare surtax applies to single filers with over $200,000 of income or married couples with $250,000. (These amounts aren't indexed for inflation.) The tax hike is one part of the administration's push to raise taxes on Americans who earn more than $400,000 a year. Biden is expected to unveil the proposal next week as a way to fund the American Families Plan, which would expand subsidies for child care and make community college tuition free for all, among other things. Many aspects of the plan remain unclear, though. For example, the plan may exempt a certain portion of wealthy investors' capital gains from the higher tax, according to tax experts. It may also exempt certain taxpayers, like some business owners, from the levy.

Your questions answered Use your Covid travel vouchers before they expire It's also uncertain whether Democrats, who have the narrowest of majorities in the Senate, would be able to pass the proposal as written. Even if it passes, the effective date of the tax hike remains unknown. The S&P 500 erased earlier gains and closed 0.9% lower after published news reports. "I wouldn't necessarily push the sell button on rumors," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer and founding partner of Cresset Capital Management, said Thursday on CNBC. "That doesn't make a lot of sense to me. "There will be plenty of time to plan and respond to any tax or tax proposal that's ultimately in place," he added. Sitting tight is likely the appropriate approach for long-term investors, LaBrecque said. Just four years ago, the Trump administration was cutting taxes for many individuals, he noted, as an example of how quickly conditions can change. "If you know you're going to be sitting on something a long time, don't worry about it," LaBrecque said of the Biden proposal. But taxpayers who know they'll be selling a highly appreciated asset next year anyway, for example, should consider doing it now just in case capital-gains taxes do increase, he added. If a proposal becomes law, it would change financial planning in ways beyond selling investments. For example, individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans could become more attractive, since taxpayers wouldn't be subject to the 3.8% Medicare surtax, LaBrecque said. Employees may also be better off getting a cash bonus instead of restricted stock units, he added. "There are weird aspects to this whole thing," he said.
The Biden administration said it will immediately make raw materials needed for India's coronavirus vaccine production available as the country's Covid-19 infections surge. India set a new global record for coronavirus cases this weekend. The U.S. response comes after Britain, France and Germany pledged aid to India over the weekend.	WASHINGTON – The Biden administration said that it will immediately make raw materials needed for India's coronavirus vaccine production available as the country works to counter the surge of Covid-19 infections. In recent weeks, India has grappled with a staggering rise in new coronavirus infections. Over the weekend, India set another global record for daily cases, bringing the nation's cumulative total to 16,960,172 cases, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins . "Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, the United States is determined to help India in its time of need," National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne said in a statement on Sunday. Horne added that the United States would send raw materials required for India to manufacture the Covishield vaccine, as well as therapeutics, rapid diagnostic test kits, ventilators and protective equipment. "The U.S. Development Finance Corporation is funding a substantial expansion of manufacturing capability for BioE, the vaccine manufacturer in India, enabling BioE to ramp up to produce at least 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022," Horne wrote, adding that the U.S. would also send a team of public health advisors from the Center for Disease Control and USAID to India. The announcement comes on the heels of a Sunday call between Biden National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and India's National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. Sullivan "affirmed America's solidarity with India, the two countries with the greatest number of Covid-19 cases in the world," according to a readout of the call. The U.S. response comes after Britain, France and Germany pledged aid to India over the weekend. On Sunday, Biden wrote on Twitter that his administration was "determined to help India in its time of need." Last week, as the United States administered a new record of 200 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine, Biden told reporters that his administration was looking at more ways to help internationally. "We're looking at what is going to be done with some of the vaccines that we are not using. We're going to make sure they are safe to be sent," Biden said on April 21 . "We don't have enough to be confident to send it abroad now.  But I expect we're going to be able to do that," he added.
The Biden administration is slated to relax federal public health guidance on wearing masks outdoors as soon as this week. The announcement, which may come as early as Tuesday, could be supplemented with differing guidance for fully vaccinated people and those who have not received a coronavirus vaccine. White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci indicated that the new mask guidance was imminent but also warned that Americans should continue to adhere to public health measures until the CDC makes an assessment.	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is slated to relax federal public health guidance on wearing masks outdoors as soon as this week, a source familiar with the plans told NBC News. The announcement, which may come as early as Tuesday, could give separate recommendations for fully vaccinated people and those who have not received a coronavirus vaccine, added the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The administration is still finalizing the guidance, NBC reported. Over the weekend, White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci indicated that the new mask guidance was imminent but also warned that Americans should adhere to public health measures until the CDC makes an assessment. "What I believe you're going to be hearing, what the country is going to be hearing soon, is updated guidelines from the CDC," Fauci told ABC's Sunday program "This Week With George Stephanopoulos." "The CDC is a science-based organization. They don't want to make any guidelines unless they look at the data and the data backs it up." "But when you look around at the common sense situation, the risk is really low, especially if you're vaccinated," he said. The CDC's current guidance states that "masks may not be necessary when you are outside by yourself away from others, or with people who live in your household." "However, some areas may have mask mandates while out in public, so please check the rules in your local area (such as in your city, county, or state). Additionally, check whether any federal mask mandates apply to where you will be going," the agency adds. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto, said he supports the anticipated guidance from the CDC. He added that more research is showing that very few Covid-19 infections happen in outdoor settings. But masks should still be mandated in indoor settings, he said, until most of the U.S. population is vaccinated and it is difficult for the virus to spread from one person to the next. "It's been over a year. We have a very good understanding of who gets infected and how they get infected," he told CNBC in a phone interview. "I think it's fair to say you don't need to wear a mask outside unless you can't maintain 2 meters or 6 feet of social distancing." "Masking outdoors likely doesn't provide much added protection,' he added. On Monday, Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC that he believes outdoor mask mandates are no longer necessary as the U.S. vaccinates more people. More than 42% of the U.S. population has received at least one vaccine dose, including 28.5% who have been fully vaccinated, according to CDC data . "People could choose to wear a mask if they want to. I think there shouldn't be requirements that they have to wear masks outdoors," the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner said on "Squawk Box."
President Joe Biden is expected to propose higher capital gains taxes for people with incomes of more than $1 million. The top rate would rise to 39.6%, from 20%. The policy would cost the U.S. $33 billion over a decade if it doesn't also eliminate the so-called "step-up in basis" at death, according to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. That's because the wealthy would likely use the rule more regularly to avoid tax, Wharton said. Biden's plan would raise $113 billion if it scraps the tax break for heirs.	President Joe Biden is expected to pitch a higher capital gains tax this week to raise funds for his economic agenda. But the policy would lose the U.S. billions in revenue if it doesn't also scrap a tax break for heirs, according to a new analysis. Eliminating that tax break — known as a "step-up in basis" at death — would raise $113 billion over a decade starting in 2022, when coupled with a higher tax on capital gains, according to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. More from Personal Finance: Calls to end $10,000 SALT deduction cap threaten Biden's tax plan Tensions rise as return-to-work plans gain steam Social Security cost-of-living adjustment not keeping up with prices retirees pay But the anticipated capital-gains proposal would cost the U.S. $33 billion over that period if it doesn't get rid of that step-up, according to the analysis . Biden called for an elimination of a step-up in basis at death as a presidential candidate. Biden's plan is expected to call for a 39.6% top tax rate on long-term capital gains, up from the current 20%. The tax would apply to returns on assets held more than a year and to taxpayers with more than $1 million in income. When combined with a Medicare surtax on investment earnings, the top federal capital-gains tax rate would be 43.4% . Current law allows investors to avoid tax on unrealized capital gains (or, appreciation in unsold assets). They can do so by holding stocks and other assets until death. At that point, assets essentially transfer from an estate tax-free: Heirs get the asset at its current market value (thereby eliminating the gain on paper) and the estate doesn't pay tax on the unrealized gain. (Wealthy estates may still owe state or federal estate tax on the asset.) Raising taxes on capital gains means people who earn more than $1 million a year may opt to hold investments longer — and bequeath them to heirs tax-free — as a tax-avoidance strategy. It's one reason Wharton projects a $33 billion loss from a higher capital-gains tax regime if it isn't coupled with an end to the step up in basis. "Reforms such as eliminating stepped-up basis … would restrict those avoidance opportunities, therefore increasing revenue raised per percentage point of capital gains tax," according to the analysis, published Friday. Roughly 0.3% of taxpayers (about 540,000 people) reported income over $1 million in 2018, meaning they'd be subject to the expected tax increase, according to the most recent IRS data.
President Joe Biden is set to unveil his new tax plan on Wednesday night. The proposal will keep to his campaign promise of no tax increases for anyone making $400,000 or less. Yet experts say the complex plan could ultimately end up touching some people below that threshold.	President Joe Biden will formally unveil his new tax plan during his first presidential address on Wednesday that includes a key campaign promise — no one making $400,000 or less should see increased taxes. Some experts wonder whether his sweeping plan can keep to that pledge. "I challenge you to find an economist who will say that is even possible," said William McBride, vice president for federal tax and economic policy at the Tax Foundation. The reason, according to McBride, is that everyone in the economy is connected. "If you raise tax on this taxpayer here, good luck in isolating that effect to just that taxpayer," McBride said. "It's not actually possible." More from Personal Finance: Workers could get 12 weeks of paid leave under Biden's plan Selling assets to avoid a higher capital gains tax? You may trigger another tax The Fed keeps rates near zero — here's how you can benefit Biden's $400,000 income target has been a subject of hot debate as details of his tax plan emerge. Some of the discussion has been on where that threshold would kick in. In March, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said it would be for families , which sparked speculation that individuals earning less than $400,000 could see higher levies as a result. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "For the most part, I think he can design something ... where the tax increases are, in fact, targeted to people making $400,000 or more," said Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. However, some people with incomes below $400,000 may inadvertently see some effects. "I think it's impossible to design something that's not going to catch somebody in some situation," Gleckman said. For example, former President Barack Obama set a cap at $250,000 in tax proposals he put forward under his leadership. An increase to $400,000, coupled with low inflation over the past couple of years, would mean fewer households would be affected by the policy, Gleckman said. Much of what Biden is planning focuses on high earners. The plan would increase the top tax rate for wealthiest Americans to 39.6%, up from 37%. A 39.6% tax rate would also apply to capital gains and dividends for households that earn more than $1 million. With the existing 3.8% net investment income tax, that would bring the top capital gains rate to 43.4%, McBride said. Low- and moderate-income people already do not pay much in capital gains taxes, so the changes are unlikely to affect people making less than $400,000, according to Gleckman. One key thing to watch with any new capital gains rate is the date it becomes effective, whether immediately or later this year or next, Gleckman said. News that Biden planned to hike capital gains taxes resulted in higher stock market volatility last week. "That could have some effects on short-term trading, although in the long run it won't make any difference," Gleckman said. The president's plan also calls for limiting a strategy known as "step-up in basis," whereby wealthy individuals can avoid paying taxes on gains by passing those assets down to their heirs. Under Biden's plan, the strategy would be cut off for gains over $1 million, or $2.5 million per couple when including existing real estate exemptions. "It amounts essentially to an additional estate tax, because it applies at death," McBride said. The step-up in basis proposal will likely be extremely contentious on Capitol Hill, McBride predicted. However, the entire proposal is unlikely to get much Republican support, he said. In order for Biden's tax changes to become law, it would need to pass via a so-called reconciliation bill later this year, which would allow Democrats to approve the changes on a party-line basis. "The only hope for these things to make it through is reconciliation on a strictly partisan basis and to get every single Democrat in the Senate in particular to agree to it," McBride said. "That's a one-time shot."
The U.S. Senate on Wednesday voted to reverse former President Donald Trump's move to weaken Obama-era regulations designed to reduce climate-changing methane emissions from oil and gas fields. The 52-42 vote sets up the first official reinstatement of one of more than 100 climate regulations dismantled by the Trump administration. Regulating methane gas is critical for advancing President Joe Biden's goal to slash U.S. emissions in half from 2005 levels over the next decade and achieve a net-zero economy by 2050.	The U.S. Senate on Wednesday voted to reverse former President Donald Trump 's move to weaken Obama-era regulations designed to reduce climate-changing methane emissions from oil and gas fields. The 52-42 vote sets up the first official reinstatement of one of more than 100 climate regulations dismantled by the Trump administration. Regulating methane, a primary component of natural gas, is critical for advancing President Joe Biden 's goal to slash U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half from 2005 levels over the next decade and achieve a net-zero economy by 2050. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer , as well as Sens. Martin Heinrich, D-NM, Angus King, I-ME, and Edward Markey, D-Mass., introduced the resolution under the Congressional Review Act, a law which allows Congress to quickly overturn a previous administration's regulations with a simple majority vote and a signature from the president. The Democratic-held House is expected to approve the measure and send it to President Joe Biden. The White House supports the passage of the bill, according to a statement on Tuesday from the Office of Management and Budget. Passing the bill would reinstate the 2012 and 2016 Oil and Natural Gas New Source Performance Standards set by the Obama administration. The Trump administration's rollback last year eliminated federal requirements for oil and gas companies to monitor and repair methane leaks from pipelines, storage facilities and wells. In a briefing before the Senate vote, Schumer said the vote was one of the most important steps Congress can take to fight climate change. "This is a very big deal," Schumer said. "Methane is one of the most poisonous things we can put in our atmosphere." Three Republican senators voted for the bill: Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rob Portman of Ohio. On his first day in office, Biden in an executive order directed the Environmental Protection Agency to reverse Trump's methane rollback and propose new regulations for industry producers. Trump's effort to dismantle the rule was a victory for the oil and gas industry, which comprises nearly 30% of U.S. methane emissions. Smaller oil and gas companies and fossil fuel lobbyists who supported Trump's rollback have argued that methane regulations are too expensive. Major oil and gas companies like BP , Shell and Exxon , who have promoted natural gas as a cleaner fuel than coal, have voiced support for methane regulation. A spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest trade group, said the group is working with the Biden administration "in support of the direct regulation of methane for new and existing sources through a new rulemaking process." "We have an opportunity to build on the progress the industry has made in driving down methane emissions through technological advancement, and we are committed to finding common ground on cost-effective government policies," the spokesperson said. The Senate vote was also welcomed by scientists and environmental groups who have long said that curbing methane emissions is vital is avoiding the worst impacts of climate change . Methane is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide and accounts for 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Methane also doesn't last as long as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which makes it a good target for reducing global warming more quickly, in addition to efforts to slash carbon emissions. "This vote reinforces President Biden's direction, in his Day One executive order, for EPA to set strong limits on the rampant methane leakage from both new and existing oil and gas operations across the country," said David Doniger, senior strategic director of the climate and clean energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Carbon dioxide and methane emissions hit record highs in 2020 despite worldwide lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to research from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Such a sustained increase in emissions could heat up the atmosphere by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, significantly higher than the Paris climate accord target to keep warming below 2 degrees. A new study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters suggests that a push to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, agriculture other human sources could slow global warming by as much as 30%. "Today's bipartisan vote marks the beginning of the restoration of sensible methane policy at the federal level," said Dan Grossman, senior director of regulatory and legislative affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund. "Oil and gas producers, environmental advocates and members of both parties agree that we need to get methane regulation back on track," Grossman said.
President Joe Biden unveiled his American Families Plan on Wednesday. The proposal seeks to raise $1.5 trillion over a decade via higher taxes on the top 1%. The revenue would fund expanded education, child care and paid leave, among other things. The Biden tax plan would raise levies on capital gains and ordinary income and increase tax audits for those earning more than $400,000 a year.	Taxes may soon be going up for the wealthy. President Joe Biden aims to fund expanded education, child care, paid leave and other reforms by collecting more tax revenue from Americans who make more than $400,000 a year. He would do so by raising the top income and capital gains tax rates, changing the taxation of wealthy estates, closing so-called tax loopholes and focusing audits of the rich to prevent tax evasion. All told, the American Families Plan would raise $1.5 trillion over a decade by taxing the highest earners, according to the White House. More from Personal Finance: Biden tax plan could save some nearly $15,000 a year on child care Workers could get 12 weeks of paid leave under Biden's plan Biden's American Families Plan could make free college a reality "I think you should be able to become a billionaire or a millionaire," Biden told Congress on Wednesday night in a speech outlining his agenda. "But pay your fair share." The richest 1% of taxpayers, who have an average income of $2.2 million, would shoulder the burden of the tax hike, according to an analysis published by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Two-thirds of this group would see their taxes increase, by an average $159,000 a year, according to the analysis. Of course, the proposal faces headwinds in Congress. Passage isn't guaranteed and parts of the plan may change. Biden's tax plan would raise the top income tax rate to 39.6%. That was the highest rate before the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered it to the current 37%. The 39.6% rate would apply to the top 1% of Americans, according to the White House. Households with more than roughly $540,000 of income fall among the wealthiest 1% of taxpayers, according to Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation. However, the precise income thresholds at which the 39.6% rate would kick in for single taxpayers and married joint filers are unclear. They would likely correlate with the current 37% top rate, Watson said. That rate applies to income in excess of $523,600 for single filers and $628,300 for married couples. This aspect of Biden's proposal would raise about $110 billion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation. Biden is essentially fast-tracking a future change to the tax code — the top income tax rate is already scheduled to revert to 39.6% after 2025, per language in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The American Families Plan would also change how the rich pay tax on investment returns in two big ways. "These parts of the proposal, to me, would impact wealthiest people the most," said David Herzig, a principal at Ernst & Young's private client services tax group. For one, Biden's plan would raise the top tax rate on long-term capital gains to 39.6% — the same rate as their wages. (Including a 3.8% Medicare surtax, they would pay a 43.4% top rate.) It would be an increase from the current 20% (or, 23.8% including the surtax on net investment income). The policy applies to taxpayers with annual income of more than $1 million — the top 0.3% — who sell stocks, bonds and other assets held in taxable accounts for a gain. The wealthy get a much larger share of their annual income from investments relative to lower earners. Investments account for more than 40% of income for taxpayers who make at least $1 million a year, according to a Tax Foundation analysis. The other sources (business income and wages) account for respectively smaller portions. By comparison, Americans who make less than $50,000 a year get around 5% of their income from investments. Wages account for more than 80%. "It will make people think a little harder when they decide they want to sell and reallocate toward some other opportunity because of that tax bite," Watson said. The plan also changes how wealthy estates pay tax on appreciated assets at death — the second major part of Biden's reform to the capital gains tax The president would get rid of the so-called step up in basis at death for any gains of more than $1 million. Essentially, the appreciation of any unsold assets — also known as unrealized gains — would be subject to capital gains tax upon the owner's death. (Again, this would be as high as 43.4% for the wealthiest households.) That regime would be much different from existing law. Currently, an asset's appreciation isn't taxed at death. The asset gets a step-up in basis, meaning it transfers to heirs at its current market value, erasing the capital gain. Heirs could then sell the asset free of capital gains tax. (Estates of single individuals may owe a 40% federal estate tax on assets exceeding $11.7 million. The threshold is $23.4 million for married couples.) "This isn't the estate tax," Gordon Mermin, a principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said of Biden's proposal. "It's just taxing those gains that were never taxed." Wealthy estates would be able to omit $1 million of gains from tax at death. (It would be $2 million for couples.) This exclusion would be in addition to the existing tax break for appreciated real estate . (Single taxpayers can exclude up to $250,000 of capital gains from tax; it's $500,000 for married couples.) Let's say a wealthy couple bought a $5 million home that's worth $10 million by the time they die. The estate can exclude half of that $5 million gain from tax — and would pay tax on the remaining $2.5 million. "The exclusion here is high enough that it really is targeted at higher earners," Watson said. Family owned businesses and farms would also get an exclusion — they wouldn't have have to pay tax when the business or farm is passed to heirs who continue to run the business, according to the White House. It's unclear how Biden's proposal to tax unrealized gains at death would interact with the federal estate tax, experts said. (For example, might taxes paid on unrealized gains be deducted from the size of the overall estate?) "There are a lot of questions operationally how this might work," Herzig said. The White House would also allocate additional resources to the IRS to enhance tax audits of households with more than $400,000 of income. Audit rates on those making more than $1 million per year fell 80% between 2011 and 2018, according to IRS data cited by the White House, which said its enforcement plan would raise $700 billion over a decade.
President Joe Biden is asking Congress for higher taxes on inherited property to help pay for the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan. Biden’s proposal may impact family homes with more than $1 million in gains. Financial experts recommend estate planning strategies to avoid a surprise tax bill.	President Joe Biden has unveiled a plan for higher taxes on inherited homes to help fund the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan. The proposal would tax inherited property gains at death, targeting generational wealth transfers. But financial experts say the measure may impact more families than just affluent ones. "I think it could become a quagmire from a couple of different fronts," said certified financial planner Ken Van Leeuwen, founder and managing director of Van Leeuwen & Company in Princeton, New Jersey. More from Personal Finance: Workers could get 12 weeks of paid leave under Biden's plan Selling assets to avoid a higher capital gains tax? You may trigger another tax The Fed keeps rates near zero — here's how you can benefit Currently, heirs may defer taxes on inherited home gains until they sell the property. They also secure a so-called "step up in basis," which adjusts the home's purchase price generally to the value on the date of death. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the current law saves taxpayers $41 billion per year. By comparison, Biden wants to treat home inheritances like a sale, making the heirs pay for gains that occurred before they received the property. This change may deliver a bill for capital gains taxes at death . The proposal includes tax exemptions up to $1 million for single heirs and up to $2.5 million for couples, a White House fact sheet outlined Wednesday. For example, let's say someone inherits a $1.5 million family home purchased for $300,000. That person may owe capital gains tax on $200,000 of the $1.2 million profit. Van Leeuwen said the levy may be a burden for heirs who want to keep the family home but can't afford the tax bill. While the median U.S. home sales price is $347,500, the number of transactions exceeding $1 million is growing. Sales of home worth more than $1 million spiked by  81% from February 2020 to 2021, according to the National Association of Realtors. Financial experts say those affected shouldn't panic. "We'll have to see how the language shakes out," said Mallon FitzPatrick, CFP, managing director and principal at Robertson Stephens Wealth Management in San Francisco. While Biden's plan may have a significant impact, there are ways to minimize the bill. Van Leeuwen advises starting with a home appraisal and then meeting with an estate-planning attorney. One popular tactic is gifting a home or vacation property to heirs while living with a so-called qualified personal residence trust. This trust removes the home's value from an estate and allows the original owner to use the property for a specific number of years. "It's a very common strategy amongst people who have second homes that are appreciated and want to make low-cost gifts to kids," Van Leeuwen said. Another way to save on taxes is by increasing the home's basis to reduce profit. Homeowners can do that by tacking on the cost of improvements, like a new roof or other property renovations. "Increase the cost basis to where it should be," said FitzPatrick. "It's a good thing to do and will have a positive impact if these rules change." This method may be complex for an inherited property without immaculate records, however. Other approaches may include a family partnership or limited liability corporation. "These are definitely advanced techniques but may be a way to keep the property in the family," said Van Leeuwen.
With federal student loan forgiveness on the table, you may be wondering if you'll qualify for it or if you should still be making payments. Here are some answers.	Things are looking up for the 44 million Americans saddled with student loans. President Joe Biden has said he supports canceling $10,000 in student loans per borrower. Facing pressure from other Democrats, progressives and borrowers , Biden has now also asked his Education secretary to prepare a memo on his legal authority to wipe out as much as $50,000 each for all. "I think the odds of some student loan forgiveness being enacted is as good as it has ever been," said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. More from Personal Finance: Workers could get 12 weeks of paid leave under Biden's plan Selling assets to avoid a higher capital gains tax? You may trigger another tax The Fed keeps rates near zero — here's how you can benefit Still, nothing is certain, and many borrowers have a lot of questions while they wait to learn the fate of their debt, which can impact everything from when and if they're able to buy a home to the careers they pursue . Here are some answers, based on what we know at the moment. If Biden chooses to cancel the debt through executive action, in theory borrowers could see their balances reduced or eliminated pretty quickly. But such a move may be met by court challenges, which could lead to delays. A clearer picture may soon emerge. "If Biden decides he can do it via executive order, I expect we'll hear about it by June or July," said Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors. If the White House opts to leave student loan forgiveness to Congress, Democrats would likely use the budget reconciliation process to get it done. That's because that process allows them to pass legislation with a simple majority, which is all they have. Other bills typically must garner 60 votes to advance, thanks to Senate procedural rules. Republicans are largely hostile toward the idea of a student debt jubilee. The next budget reconciliation process will likely be in the fall. Although the odds of student loan borrowers getting their balances reduced or eliminated have never been greater, "until legislation is signed into law, you can't count on anything," Kantrowitz said. Currently, there are pending reports from the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on whether the president has the legal authority to implement loan forgiveness through executive action, Kantrowitz said. It's still unclear when the findings will be published. In the meantime, he added, "borrowers should not take any precipitous action in anticipation of loan forgiveness." At the moment, the main point of contention among student loan forgiveness proponents is over how much debt should be scrapped: $10,000 or $50,000. If all federal student loan borrowers got $10,000 of their debt forgiven, the outstanding education debt in the country would fall to around $1.3 trillion, from $1.7 trillion, according to Kantrowitz. And roughly one-third of federal student loan borrowers, or 15 million people, would see their balances reset to zero. Canceling $50,000 for all borrowers, on the other hand, would shrink the country's outstanding student loan debt balance to $700 billion, from $1.7 trillion. Meanwhile, the debt for 80% of federal student loan borrowers, or 36 million people, would be gone entirely. Even under that more generous plan, not everyone would be entirely happy. One-fifth of federal student loan borrowers owe more than $50,000, and around 7% of borrowers owe more than six figures. Most federal student loan borrowers don't have to pay their bills until October, and during that time interest is suspended. Since $10,000 in student loan forgiveness is the proposal most likely to turn into reality, Mayotte said she sees nothing wrong with people who owe under that amount redirecting their usual payments to savings, "earning a little interest on them, then seeing which way the wind is blowing come August." "If it looks like we're no closer to forgiveness, pay the funds then," she said. Even if you owe more than $10,000, it can still be wise to take advantage of the government's pause on student loan payments. You can use the extra cash to wipe out high-interest credit card debt, for example, or to build up your emergency savings. There are some smart moves you can take in anticipation of student loan forgiveness, experts say. Millions of people who took out student loans before 2010 under the Federal Family Education Loan program have been excluded from the government's offer to pause their payments without interest accruing. There's now some concern these borrowers could also be left out of any student loan forgiveness. As a result, these borrowers might want to consolidate their FFEL loans into the main Direct Loan program, which will qualify for the forgiveness, Kantrowitz said. The main downside of doing so is that your repayment timeline will be reset; so, if you're near the end, it may not make sense. Meanwhile, borrowers thinking about refinancing their federal student loans into private loans for a lower interest rate may want to wait, Kantrowitz said. For one, the interest rate on most federal student loans is 0% for another five months. What's more, "they will feel foolish if they refinance only to have the federal government announce loan forgiveness," Kantrowitz said. "When it comes to private student loans, it seems highly unlikely that they would be included in the forgiveness plan," said Elaine Rubin, senior contributor and communications specialist at Edvisors . Student loan forgiveness is now tax-free, thanks to a provision included in the $1.9 trillion federal coronavirus stimulus package that became law in March. Formerly, any student loan debt canceled by the government was considered taxable and levied at the borrower's normal income tax rate. According to a rough estimate by Kantrowitz, $10,000 in cancellation would have triggered an extra $2,000 in taxes for the average borrower. If $50,000 per borrower was canceled, the average person would have to write the IRS a check for $10,000. Borrowers would now be off the hook from these bills.
The Biden administration is looking to distribute the coronavirus vaccine to India and other countries now that millions of Americans have received their doses. Over the weekend, India reported 400,000 daily cases, bringing the nation's cumulative total to 19,557,457 cases, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins. On Friday, the White House announced that it would restrict travel from India as the country works to counter its surge of Covid-19 infections.	WASHINGTON – White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said Sunday that the Biden administration is looking to distribute the coronavirus vaccine to India and other countries now that millions of Americans have received their doses. In recent weeks, India has grappled with a staggering rise in new coronavirus infections. Over the weekend, India reported 400,000 daily cases, bringing the nation's cumulative total to 19,557,457 cases, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins . The spike may have been triggered by a highly contagious Covid variant, known as B.1.617, which was first identified in the country. The variant has since been identified in other countries, including the United States. On Friday, the White House announced that it would restrict travel from India as the country works to counter its surge of Covid-19 infections. "We are rushing aid to India," Klain said during an interview on CBS program "Face the Nation." Klain said that the U.S. has sent therapeutics, rapid diagnostic test kits, ventilators and protective equipment to the world's largest democracy as well as raw materials crucial for vaccine production. "Our U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai is going to the WTO next week to start talks on how we can get this vaccine more widely distributed, more widely licensed, more widely shared," he said when asked if the Biden administration would relax patent protections on the coronavirus vaccine. Klain added that he expected the White House to have more to say on the matter in the coming days. Earlier this month, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed lifting the patent protections of the coronavirus vaccine with Biden, according to a readout of the call . The relaxation would grant governments quicker and more affordable access to the lifesaving doses. Last week, the Biden administration announced that it will immediately make raw materials needed for India's coronavirus vaccine production available . The U.S. response came after Britain, France and Germany pledged aid to India, the world's largest democracy. Rich nations have come under fire in recent days for hoarding the raw materials needed to make the shots.
President Joe Biden is calling on Congress for a tax hike on real estate investors to help fund the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan. Biden’s plan abolishes the right to defer taxes on property gains over $500,000. The measure may affect more people than wealthy investors, financial experts say.	Real estate investors may soon pay more taxes on high-dollar transactions. President Joe Biden is asking for higher taxes on real estate transactions with gains of more than $500,000. The tax plan aims to help cover the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan, which pumps money into child care, paid family leave and education programs. However, financial experts say the tax hike may also put a strain on smaller investors. The strategy on the chopping block — so-called like-kind or 1031 exchanges — allows investors to defer paying taxes on real estate by rolling profits into their next property. More from Personal Finance: How Biden's capital gains proposal may hit middle-class home sellers Biden's inherited real estate tax may impact more people than just the wealthy Biden promises no new taxes salaries under $400,000. Experts have doubts "You don't have to take a haircut for Uncle Sam's share every time you move from one investment to another," said Michael Repak, vice president and senior estate planner at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Currently, investors can use 1031 exchanges to buy and sell tax-deferred real estate throughout life. If the investor holds the property until death, they can pass it on to heirs tax-free. "This has been a great way for real estate investors to make money," said Matt Berquist, a Jacksonville, Florida-based certified financial planner and managing director at Intrepid Capital Management. The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that 1031 exchanges may save investors $41.4 billion in taxes from 2020 to 2024. Biden aims to reel in 1031 exchanges on transactions with profits exceeding $500,000. The effects may be far-reaching, financial experts say, especially with the call for an increase in capital gains taxes . About 12% of real estate sales were part of a 1031 exchange from 2016 to 2019, according to a 2020 survey from the National Association of Realtors. Those investors may not be the real estate tycoons many expect. Although Biden's plan targets the wealthy , the proposal may also hit smaller investors. The Realtors survey showed 84% of 1031 exchanges were by smaller investors — those in sole proprietorships (47%) or S corporations (37%). "There will be some unintended consequences if it all goes through," Berquist said. Small businesses looking to exchange property may face some tough decisions. For example, let's say a dental practice owns a $1.2 million building it had originally purchased for $500,000. Under current law, the owners can exchange the property for a "like-kind" office building and defer taxes by adding the $700,000 profit into a new building they've bought. The new law would charge capital gains taxes on the company's profit above the $500,000 exemption. Repak said the new rule could make it difficult for those looking to exchange for a lower-maintenance property as they move into retirement. The proposed changes may also trickle down to small businesses renting property. Sixty-eight percent of those surveyed by the Realtors expect rent increases if 1031 exchange repeals occur. Repak said landlords may try to recoup losses or extra taxes by charging more rent. "Renters are probably the easiest to try and push that onto," he said. While details are still murky, Repak said some investors are starting to prepare for changes. He said it's prudent to begin talking with your estate planning attorney and accountant. Those impacted shouldn't make an impulsive decision, however. "There are all kinds of things on the docket that could change for folks," Berquist said. "People need to be ready and open to making changes as necessary."
President Joe Biden is proposing higher taxes on the top 1% to help pay for the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan. But the “marriage penalty” may hit couples earning more than $500,000. Financial experts say tax planning strategies may lessen the sting.	The wealthiest Americans may soon face a slew of tax hikes. President Joe Biden wants to raise taxes on single filers likely with income over $452,700 and couples earning more than $509,300. But the plan may wind up penalizing some higher-earning married couples. "It's not the first time we've seen a marriage penalty," said Sabina Smailhodzic Lewis, certified financial planner and co-owner at Avant-Garde Wealth in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The so-called "marriage penalty" happens when couples pay more taxes together than individually . Couples earning similar incomes are more likely to be affected, according to the Tax Policy Center. "There's a certain level that our government officials think is enough income per person or household," Smailhodzic Lewis said. More from Personal Finance: How Biden's capital gains proposal may hit middle-class home seller Biden's inherited real estate tax may impact more people than just the wealthy How Biden's real estate tax plan may hit smaller property investors Currently, the tax code separates single and married filers, with a top rate of 37% for individuals earning over $523,600 and couples making more than $628,300. Biden wants to increase the highest tax rate to 39.6% , impacting the "top 1%," according to the White House plan outlined Wednesday. The proposal may still affect individuals making less than $400,000, however. For example, let's say each person makes $260,000. Under Biden's plan, those couples may pay higher taxes filing together than on their own. The measure would apply to fewer than 1% of families, the latest filing data from the IRS shows. But impacted couples may get a surprise at tax time, financial experts say. "This creates a need for very specific analysis for married couples," said Alvina Lo, New York-based chief wealth strategist at Wilmington Trust. Luckily, financial experts say there's time to prepare for any impending tax changes. If the law doesn't kick in until 2022, Smailhodzic Lewis said to watch the timing of year-end or first-quarter income. Self-employed filers may try to accelerate 2022 income into late 2021 before the measure goes into effect. Couples over the threshold may also explore filing taxes separately. "The way the numbers shake out, because of the way our tax system works, you can definitely get into situations where you are better off if you are single," said Lo. Those impacted may need to prioritize deductions, she said. Couples may consider tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or individual retirement account to reduce income. Those itemizing tax deductions may also consider charitable gifts. "Any deductions that you can take are going to be a lot more important," she said. With details still in flux, high-earners may be tempted to make portfolio changes, leveraging current capital gains rates. But Lo warns against knee-jerk reactions to the proposal. "You really need to have a plan and be ready to pull the trigger on strategies, depending on which way the wind blows," she said.
A petition on Change.org calling on the president to cancel student debt has been signed by more than 1 million people. CNBC spoke to some of the signees about why they added their names, and how their lives would look different without the loans.	Every day, Austin Hossfeld types the same words into Google : "Biden" and "student loans." "A lot of the times, it's the same articles," Hossfeld, 26, said. "I reread them. "At night, I talk to my wife about it." Like so many other Americans, the Carroll, Ohio, resident is eager for any new information on what President Joe Biden will decide to do, if anything, about the country's $1.7 trillion outstanding student loan balance. Recently, Hossfeld's online searching led him to a Change.org petition calling on the president to cancel all of that debt. More from Personal Finance: How travelers could benefit from hotel industry struggles What to expect as live music events take to the stage again State Dept. says 80% of world is unsafe. What to know He signed it. So have more than 1 million other people . "It's a no-brainer to help the lives of millions of people," he said. On the campaign trail, Biden said he supported forgiving $10,000 in student loans for all borrowers, but more recently he has asked his Education secretary to prepare a memo on his legal authority to wipe out as much as $50,000 each for all. That's after he faced mounting pressure from other Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Sen. Elizabeth Warren , from Massachusetts, to go further. Increasingly, borrowers are also among those demanding forgiveness from the president. Erin O'Brien , an associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said the petition is likely to catch eyes in the White House. "Numbers matter," O'Brien said. "That's what moves politicians." Polling shows that two-thirds of Americans support some form of student loan forgiveness. Just 4 in 10, however, believe all the debt should be canceled. Critics of student loan forgiveness argue that it wouldn't significantly stimulate the economy , since college graduates tend to be higher earners who would likely redirect their monthly payments to savings rather than additional spending. Others say a jubilee would be unfair to those who've already paid off their student debt or never took out loans. Those borrowers "might feel that their frugality was being punished," Noah Smith, a columnist for Bloomberg, recently wrote. Advocates say that borrowers were already struggling before the public health crisis — with more than 1 in 4 in delinquency or default — and that after more than a year of record-high unemployment levels, that pain has only worsened. "Before the Covid-19 public health crisis began, student debt was already a drag on the national economy, weighing heaviest on Black and Latinx communities, as well as women," more than 400 organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Psychological Association, wrote in a letter to the White House in April. "Administrative debt cancellation will deliver real progress on your racial equity, economic recovery, and Covid-19 relief campaign priorities." Hossfeld and his wife, Hayley, owe around $50,000 in student debt. He graduated from Ohio Dominican University in 2017 with a degree in computer science, and now works as a technician in a lab. He finds the job dull, and wants to become a teacher instead. But he's scared to go back to school and take on more debt. "I feel stuck," he said. He and his wife would also love to have a child, but they worry they won't be able to afford the child-care and health expenses when they have to put $800 a month toward their student loans. "Talk about stimulus," Hossfeld said, if Biden forgave their debt. "Eight hundred dollars a month extra, for me, would be amazing," he said. "It would allow me to start a family, and get a different job. "I dream about it." Christine Angelique of Portland, Oregon, signed the Change.org petition after her mother forwarded it to her. Her student debt balance is more than $168,000. Since Angelique graduated in 2010 with a degree in interior design from the Art Institute of Portland, she hasn't been able to land a full-time job. The chain of for-profit colleges has come under fire for misleading students about their programs and career outcomes . "I ended up working a lot of part-time and seasonal jobs," Angelique, 43, said. "It's been really depressing." In 2017, she filed for bankruptcy because of her credit card debt, which she said she'd accumulated to cover bills and essentials without a steady, adequate paycheck. She wasn't able to discharge her student loans in the proceeding. Things have only worsened in the coronavirus pandemic . She was furloughed from her job at a hotel in March 2020, and has since been laid off. Some of her student loans are now in default. The six-figure debt leaves her feeling hopeless, though she knows she's not alone. "I've even commented to my mom, 'I wouldn't be surprised if there's an increase in suicides,'" she said. "It's just the way you feel trapped. "How can you move forward in life with that kind of debt?"
President Joe Biden wants to boost IRS funding by $80 billion over the next decade to fight tax evasion from wealthy Americans and corporations. The measure would beef up IRS staffing and improve technology, bringing in an estimated $700 billion in revenue over 10 years. There may be an uptick in small business tax audits and financial experts offer tips to avoid trouble.	President Joe Biden is asking for $80 billion to help the IRS crack down on tax avoidance from wealthy Americans and big corporations. The proposal seeks a boost in enforcement staffing, technology and additional bank reporting, measures that may generate an estimated $700 billion in tax revenue over the next decade. However, some financial experts say the plan may spark more audits for certain small businesses. More from Personal Finance: How Biden's capital gains proposal may hit middle-class home seller Biden's inherited real estate tax may impact more people than just the wealthy How Biden's real estate tax plan may hit smaller property investors Biden's proposal comes as the IRS struggles with the volume and complexity of returns. The agency lost more than 33,378 employees between 2010 and 2020 , including those auditing returns and collecting unpaid taxes. These cuts have resulted in fewer audits for high-earning filers. The IRS audited fewer than 2 out of every 100 taxpayers earning more than $1 million in 2020, a Syracuse University report found. While the number of millionaires have nearly doubled since 2012, tax audits have dropped by 72%, to 11,331 in 2020, from 40,965 in 2012. The funding dip has impacted more than just the wealthy, however. A recent National Taxpayer Advocate report found the IRS answers only 24% of calls, making it difficult for those grappling with the slew of tax changes amid the pandemic. Advocates say Biden's proposal may help pay for his $1.8 trillion American Families Plan, while opponents argue it may place burdens on small businesses without guaranteeing the promised tax revenue. "A robust and sustained investment in the IRS is necessary to ensure it can do its job of administering a fair and effective tax system," said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig in an email. He said the agency needs more resources for investigations into underreported income and to pursue high-income taxpayers who evade tax liability through "complex schemes." They also need improved technology for complex tax returns and tracking income. "And, it requires access to better information so that the agency can target its efforts at the most egregious offenders while helping compliant taxpayers avoid unnecessary and costly audits," he said. The budget increase will also make it easier for the IRS to provide taxpayers with timely answers to questions, he said. The plan may result in more audits for some small businesses, particularly high earners, according to financial experts. "If you're an individual making over $400,000 a year, you should feel like you have a target on your back," said Paul Axberg, a certified financial planner and CPA at Axberg Wealth Management in Sun City West, Arizona. Certain small businesses may face an audit under the plan. "I think the industries that should be concerned are those in cash," said Luis Strohmeier, a Miami-based CFP and partner at Octavia Wealth Advisors. He expects the agency to scrutinize cash-only small businesses like restaurants, retail, salons and other service-based companies. "I think going after mom and pops, where the agent goes to see them, and they have all their receipts in a shoebox, just might yield something," said Strohmeier. He said those with looser record-keeping should take the opportunity to clean up their books. Getting the call for an audit may be nerve-racking for small businesses. But those following the rules shouldn't be afraid of run-ins with Uncle Sam, financial experts say. "It's always about having good record-keeping," Axberg said. He said it's critical to save receipts for all expenses and keep books up-to-date. It will be easier for a CPA to back up your position with pristine records in the event of an audit. While the less costly do-it-yourself approach may be tempting, Strohmeier urges against it. "Make sure you get your books audited by your accounting firm and that everything matches up, just in case somebody knocks on your door," he said. Tax audits usually last for three years. But once the agency observes a small business with organized paperwork, matching and up-to-date records, they will typically leave you alone, Strohmeier said. Still, the proposal isn't final, and any affected businesses have time to prepare. "I think they should just be aware that there's gonna be a higher odds of getting an audit," Axberg said.

The Department of Justice quickly moved to appeal a ruling this week that overturned the nationwide ban on evictions. Here's what struggling renters need to know.	Renters who are financially struggling because of the coronavirus pandemic got some scary news when a federal judge overturned the national eviction moratorium two months earlier than when it was scheduled to expire. In a 20-page ruling Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich , who was appointed in 2017 by former President Donald Trump, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn't have the authority to stop landlords from evicting their tenants. But within hours, the Department of Justice said it would appeal and sought a stay of the decision, meaning the ban would remain in effect throughout the court battle. For now, the judge has granted a temporary stay, meaning renters can breathe a small sigh of relief. More from Personal Finance: Workers could get 12 weeks of paid leave under Biden's plan Selling assets to avoid a higher capital gains tax? You may trigger another tax The Fed keeps rates near zero — here's how you can benefit "There is no question the moratorium is in effect in this moment," said Emily Benfer , a visiting law professor at Wake Forest University. The CDC issued the national eviction ban in September, and it was originally slated to expire at the end of January, but President Joe Biden has extended it, first until April, and later through June . It remains to be seen if the protection remains in effect for as long as the president intended. It will depend how the current court battle unfolds. And there's always the chance Biden extends the ban yet again. In addition to the national ban, there are also some local eviction protections available and a large pot of money that tenants (and landlords) can apply for. Here's what struggling renters should know. Renters eligible for the protection should fill out the CDC's declaration and give it to their landlord as soon as possible, experts say. Who qualifies? Generally, individuals earning less than $99,000 a year and couples making under $198,000 who've been financially set back because of the pandemic or huge medical expenses. Although most states have lifted their eviction bans by now, some remain in place. Those policies should not be impacted by whatever happens with the federal moratorium. Benfer has put together a spreadsheet of the state policies. New York, for example, has extended its eviction moratorium until September . There's now more than $45 billion in rental assistance available, thanks to stimulus packages passed in December and then in March. Some programs will grant you 12 months of housing payments, others may offer funding for as many as 18 months of rent. The money is sent to your landlord, but if they refuse to accept the funds, you may be able to get them directly. Many areas already had existing rental assistance funds , and it will be through one of these that you apply for the new aid. In other cases, programs will be created to disburse the money, Benfer said. "Renters should contact local housing groups , their representatives or the local 211/311 lines to identify programs and learn how to apply," she added. The National Low Income Housing Coalition also has a database of rental assistance programs. Housing advocates are worried that property owners will take advantage of uncertainty around the CDC ban to try to push out tenants now. "Some landlords will be emboldened to mislead tenants because they know the chances the tenant will have an attorney to fight them are virtually zero," said John Pollock , coordinator of the National Coalition for a Civil Right to Counsel. That's why, if you're facing eviction, experts say your first step should be to try to get a lawyer. You can find low-cost or free legal help with an eviction in your state at Lawhelp.org . At Justshelter.org, you can search for other community resources for people at risk of eviction. One study in New Orleans found that more than 65% of tenants with no legal representation were evicted, compared with fewer than 15% of those who did.
SEC is looking into how apps encourage more stock trading and then make money off the execution of those trades, new Chairman Gary Gensler told CNBC. "There is a little bit of a conflict of interest," he said Friday, highlighting zero commissions and so-called payment for order flow. Gensler said that as technology changes the way people interact with markets, regulations to protect investors need to keep up.	SEC Chairman Gary Gensler told CNBC on Friday the agency is looking into how commission-free retail brokerage apps encourage more stock trading and then make money off m the execution of those trades. "There is a little bit of a conflict of interest," Gensler said on "Squawk Box," one day after testifying about this issue before House Financial Services Committee. "An app that says they have zero commissions is earning revenue on your trading through something called 'payment for order flow.' Someone is paying them for that order flow and paying them for that data." Gensler said the issue comes down to the so-called gamification that apps use, such as "props, leaderboards, behavioral ways to get individuals to trade more," and how apps market their platforms. Asked what should be done to change or regulate gamification and payment for order flow practices, Gensler said he's reserving judgment while the Securities and Exchange Commission seeks public comment at the matter. However, he did say, "Disclosure alone may not do it." In December, Robinhood agreed to pay a $65 million civil penalty , without admitting or denying SEC charges that the popular trading app deceived customers about how it makes money and failing to deliver the promised best execution of trades. "One of Robinhood's selling points to customers was that trading was 'commission free,' but due in large part to its unusually high payment for order flow rates, Robinhood customers' orders were executed at prices that were inferior to other brokers' prices," the SEC said at the time, about a month before Robinhood became a central figure in the GameStop saga. At the time, a Robinhood spokesperson said the firm is "fully transparent" in its communications with customers over its current revenue streams and has improved its best execution processes. Gensler acknowledged that trading apps on smartphones have certainly brought new investors to stock trading and have given them greater access to markets. But he said that as technology changes the way people interact with markets, regulations to protect investors need to keep up. Gensler was sworn in last month as President Joe Biden 's choice to lead the SEC, which serves as Wall Street's watchdog. During the presidency of Barack Obama , Gensler ran the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which regulates derivatives including futures, swaps, and certain kinds of options.
Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla warned Friday that waiving patent protections for Covid vaccines would set off a worldwide race for raw materials that threatens the safe and efficient manufacturing of Covid shots. The Biden administration endorsed the waiver proposal days earlier, in service of expanding vaccine distribution to lower-income nations currently being battered by the pandemic. But Bourla, whose company produces one of three vaccines approved for emergency use in the U.S., said he believes "categorically" that the waiver proposal will "create more problems."	Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla warned Friday that waiving patent protections for Covid vaccines — a proposal President Joe Biden just endorsed — would set off a worldwide race for raw materials that threatens the safe and efficient manufacturing of Covid shots. The Biden administration said Wednesday it supports the limited waiver of intellectual property rules in service of expanding vaccine distribution to the lower-income nations currently being battered by the pandemic . But Bourla, whose company produces one of three vaccines approved for emergency use in the U.S., said that he believes "categorically" that the waiver proposal will "create more problems." "Currently, infrastructure is not the bottleneck for us manufacturing faster," Bourla wrote in a dear colleague letter posted on LinkedIn . "The restriction is the scarcity of highly specialized raw materials needed to produce our vaccine." Pfizer's vaccine requires 280 different materials and components that are sourced from 19 countries around the world, Bourla said. He contended that without patent protections, entities with much less experienced than Pfizer at manufacturing vaccines will start competing for the same ingredients. "Right now, virtually every single gram of raw material produced is shipped immediately into our manufacturing facilities and is converted immediately and reliably to vaccines that are shipped immediately around the world," Bourla wrote. He predicted that the proposed waiver "threatens to disrupt the flow of raw materials." "It will unleash a scramble for the critical inputs we require in order to make a safe and effective vaccine," Bourla wrote. "Entities with little or no experience in manufacturing vaccines are likely to chase the very raw materials we require to scale our production, putting the safety and security of all at risk," the CEO wrote. The White House referred CNBC's outreach on Bourla's post to the Office of U.S. Trade Representative, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. World Trade Organization leaders have recently urged member nations to come to an agreement on the potential vaccine patent waivers. But even with the U.S. backing, a deal is hardly guaranteed, since the WTO's rulings are based on consensus, requiring approval from all 164 members. Germany, a WTO member and the largest economy in Europe, came out against the waiver proposal on Thursday. BioNTech , which partnered with Pfizer in developing the vaccine, is based in Germany. Bourla on LinkedIn also expressed concern that the possible vaccine waivers "will disincentivize anyone else from taking a big risk." "The recent rhetoric will not discourage us from continuing investing in science. But I am not sure if the same is true for the thousands of small biotech innovators that are totally dependent on accessing capital from investors who invest only on the premise that their intellectual property will be protected," the CEO wrote. PhRMA, the pharmaceutical industry interest groups whose member companies include Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson , another U.S. vaccine provider, called the waiver proposal "an unprecedented step that will undermine our global response to the pandemic and compromise safety." Meanwhile, CEO Stephane Bancel of Moderna , maker of the other U.S.-approved Covid shot, said he wasn't concerned about the possible waivers .
It was no accident President Joe Biden's Mideast goals were modest and aimed at avoiding resource-draining distractions. But the emergence of historic opportunity in the Middle East has taken the White House by surprise. A positive series of loosely connected events offers the best opportunity in memory for reducing tensions, ending conflict and building economic progress. Weary of the cost of their disputes, countries long at odds are talking — Saudi Arabia with Iran, Turkey with Egypt, the UAE with Qatar, Israel with any number of Arab states, alongside a number of other emerging combinations.	President Biden's long years of Senate and White House experience taught him that the Middle East could be quicksand for his presidential ambitions. So, it was no accident his Mideast goals were modest and aimed at avoiding resource-draining distractions from his domestic ambitions and international priorities: recharging the U.S. economy and rallying European and Asian allies to deal with China. The old logic was that U.S. withdrawal from Mideast affairs would leave a dangerous vacuum. The new thinking was that by keeping some distance one could encourage greater self-reliance. What has taken Biden administration officials by surprise is how quickly historic opportunity has emerged. A positive series of loosely connected events across the region offers the best opportunity in memory for reducing tensions, ending conflict, building economic progress, and advancing Mideast integration. Their combined effect should be to prompt the Biden administration to recalibrate its "do-no-harm" approach to the region and lift its ambitions. For starters, it should focus on the four leading indicators of change and explore how to build upon them. To help any of this along would not require the sort of military deployments, endless commitments or costly investments that have so soured Americans to the region. What it would take is a heightened level of diplomatic and economic creativity, and the dusting off of history books to study how the U.S. helped Europe end centuries of conflict after World War II and build the institutions and cooperative habits that endure until today. The process should begin by studying the dynamics of what's unfolding, staying out of what's working well and engaging where doing so would support fragile progress. Weary of the financial and reputational cost of their disputes, countries long at odds are talking — Saudi Arabia with Iran, Turkey with Egypt, the UAE with Qatar, and Israel with any number of Arab states, alongside other emerging combinations. Warring parties in Libya and Yemen, though far from solutions, are looking for ways to de-escalate. National leaders have stepped up their efforts at economic growth, sensing the demands of a well-educated, rising generation that understands global standards. Most intriguing, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been holding secret talks since January, apparently without U.S. involvement, and brokered by Iraq. In a dramatic change of tone, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman said :  "We do not want the situation with Iran to be difficult. On the contrary, we want it to prosper and grow as we have Saudi interest in Iran, and they have Iranian interests in Saudi Arabia, which is to drive prosperity and growth in the region and the entire world." Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has many reasons for changing course. Among them was the shock of a highly sophisticated Iranian attack on Saudi oil installations in September 2019, costing Riyadh some $2 billion. The event not only exposed the kingdom's vulnerabilities and Iran's growing capabilities, it also raised doubts about U.S. security guarantees even from as close a friend as President Donald Trump, who did not retaliate on Riyadh's behalf. "The concern that Biden will make overly nice with Iran," says the Atlantic Council's Kirsten Fontenrose, "while drawing down from the region and de-prioritizing the bilateral relationship is crucial to Saudi's calculus right now." Reeling economically and isolated politically, Turkey also has been mending fences with Egypt , Saudi Arabia , the UAE , and Israel —who have been wary of Istanbul's support for the Muslim Brotherhood and other groups they consider extremist. And building off last year's historic Abraham Accords, a senior Mideast official says Israel and the UAE will start talks next month on a free-trade agreement, just one of many efforts to seize the momentum of normalized relations. Continuing to act as an outsized regional elixir for economic modernization and political moderation, the UAE this week liberalized its residency requirements to attract wealthy expats, and it has set the goal of doubling its GDP within the decade, in particular through technological investments. Separately and inspired by the Abraham accords, officials from Israel, the UAE, Greece and Cyprus met in April, with the backdrop of the east Mediterranean, to deepen their cooperation on everything from energy to fighting the pandemic. Taken individually, these indicators  may appear more tenuous than transformational. Tie them together and build upon them more methodically, however, and the Middle East could have the beginnings of the sort of conflict de-escalation, economic cooperation and institution building that Europe enjoyed after World War II. With growing security threats in the Horn of Africa and new uncertainties regarding Afghanistan's future, the U.S. would like to be able to call upon steadier Middle East partners to better address growing uncertainties elsewhere in their broader neighborhood. No one should expect the Middle East in the short-term to sprout its own equivalent of the European Union, NATO or the CSCE, the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe that provided the venue for talks between the Cold War's rival factions. One also should not expect the U.S. to play the galvanizing role it did then, when it had half of global GDP, much of Europe was in rubble and the Soviet Union was rising as an adversary to counter. That said, it would be wrong to underestimate the positive potential U.S. influence. The Trump administration's support for the Abraham Accords helped unlock growing cooperation among the signatories: Israel, the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan. The Biden administration has endorsed the agreements, most recently in a conversation this week between President Biden and UAE Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed. Biden administration officials, however, should invest more into building upon the accords. President Biden's resumption of efforts to negotiate with Iran, his focus on human rights issues, and his reluctance to feed the region's divisions also plays a positive role, as long as negotiators don't set the bar too low to lift sanctions on Tehran. What the Biden administration must avoid is listening to the wrong-headed conclusion of some analysts that U.S. disengagement from the region would accelerate progress. What's needed instead is consistent support for the region's rising forces of modernization and moderation, which have gained but still have far to go.

Several progressive organizations have banded together to launch a new campaign to target groups that have pushed back on elements of President Joe Biden's multitrillion-dollar agenda. Nearly 20 groups have signed on to the campaign so far, including Patriotic Millionaires, a group of millionaires who believe the rich should pay higher taxes. The effort will initially target the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute.	Several progressive organizations have banded together to launch a new influence campaign to target groups, such as billionaire Charles Koch's political network, which have pushed back on significant elements of President Joe Biden's multitrillion-dollar agenda. Details of the campaign, called "Stop Deficit Squawks," were first shared with CNBC. It launched Monday. Nearly 20 groups have signed on to the campaign so far, including Patriotic Millionaires, a group of millionaires who believe the rich should pay higher taxes. Activist groups Indivisible and Tax March, which is currently running a seperate campaign calling for higher taxes , are also involved. The effort will initially target the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute. All of these groups have either pushed back or lobbied against aspects of Biden's massive spending agenda, which is geared toward revamping infrastructure, increasing green technology, and providing health and education aid to families. "When we get into the heat of the battle, I think this is going to be a huge fight and it's imperative we get everybody aligned to understand that in addition to advancing the Biden agenda, we are going to need to respond to these attacks as they come around on the deficit," Margarida Jorge, executive director of Health Care for America Now, told CNBC in an interview Monday. The group is involved in the "Stop Deficit Squawks" campaign. Health Care for America Now, according to its website, has ties to the New Venture Fund, a 501(c)(3) dark money group that raised over $450 million from anonymous donors in 2019, according to the nonprofit's most recent 990 disclosure form. The progressive groups' campaign comes as Biden and Democrats face Republican criticism for big-ticket spending proposals. Biden signed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill in March and is looking to pass an infrastructure proposal that could cost around $2 trillion. He also proposed a families plan, which would include $1.8 trillion in spending and tax breaks. Several conservative-leaning groups have already started criticizing Biden's infrastructure plan, with much of the comments focusing on a proposed hike in the corporate tax rate. To counter that push, the progresive groups plan a six-figure ad campaign that's set to be launched in the coming weeks. They also launched a website blasting organizations and politicians concerned about the deficit. "Deficit squawks like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Americans for Prosperity, American Enterprise Institute, and Heritage Foundation are funded by corporate and far-right special interests bent on dismantling vital and popular safety net programs — by creating what even they admit is an artificial crisis around the deficit," the website says. There will also be a grassroots element to the campaign. Members of some of the coalition groups will pressure individual lawmakers across the country to back the spending plans and reject deficit hawks' criticism. It will represent one of the largest organized efforts advocating for Biden's big spending plans. "Just being organized and ready to respond is at the heart of this effort," Amy Traub, an associate director of the progressive group Demos, told CNBC in a phone interview on Monday. Demos' website lists its top donors, including NextGen America, an advocacy group created by billionaire Tom Steyer; the Omidyar Network, a philanthropic investment firm created by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar; and the grant-making network Open Society Foundations, founded by billionaire George Soros. The campaign's website connects GOP pushback to various groups' criticism of Biden's plans. It links to a previous statement by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in which he cites the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's president, Maya MacGuineas, as a critic of some of the facets of the Biden Covid relief bill. "Only about 1 percent of the entire package goes toward COVID vaccines, and 5 percent is truly focused on public health needs surrounding the pandemic," MacGuineas said in a statement in February. "Meanwhile, nearly half of the package will be spent on poorly targeted rebate checks and state and local government aid, including to households and governments that have experienced little or no financial loss during this crisis." The site also takes aim at Americans for Prosperity for criticizing the Covid relief bill by quoting an AFP press release that claims the legislation is "packed with unnecessary spending." "AFP believes any COVID relief spending should be timely, temporary, and targeted to those hit hardest by the pandemic," the Americans for Prosperity statement says.
President Joe Biden is calling for a tax hike on wealthy Americans, raising the top capital gains rate to 39.6% from 20%. While the plans face pushback from Congress, financial advisors are already exploring tax strategies, such as charitable deductions. Biden’s proposals may make some charitable giving techniques more attractive.	President Joe Biden 's plan to tax the wealthy may trigger a shift in charitable giving strategies. The administration is calling for more taxes on the top 1% of households — including a hike on the highest capital gains rate to 39.6%, from 20% — to help pay for his $1.8 trillion American Families Plan. Biden also wants to tax inherited property at death, aiming for generational wealth transfers. While the plan faces opposition, financial advisors are considering tax planning with their clients. They say Biden's proposal may make some charitable giving tactics more attractive. More in Personal Finance: Op-ed: How to reduce tax increase exposure with charitable contributions Some couples may face a 'marriage penalty' under Biden's tax plan How Biden's real estate tax plan may hit smaller property investors "I would argue that the link between tax incentives to give to charity, and people with the desire to give to charity, is actually pretty weak," said David Foster, certified financial planner and founder of Gateway Wealth Management in St. Louis. Only 17% of wealthy donors say they are always motivated to give based on tax benefits, according to a Bank of America study on high-net-worth philanthropy. Foster said the No. 1 concern of affluent donors is "will my dollars actually make the impact?" Still, Biden's proposal may present tax-savings opportunities for philanthropic Americans. The government offers a tax deduction to encourage gifts to qualified charitable organizations . To claim the write-off for 2020, single taxpayers need more than $12,400 in itemized deductions , and married couples must have over $24,800. Itemized deductions may include limited charitable gifts, medical expenses, state and local taxes, mortgage interest and more. Currently, taxpayers may deduct charitable gifts of up to 100% of adjusted gross income for cash contributions. But financial experts say donating cash may not offer the highest tax benefit. While Congress is still wrestling over Biden's plans, financial experts say it's a good time for wealthy Americans to start weighing options. "It's unlikely capital gains rates will ever be lower than they are today," said Ian Weinberg, a Woodbury, New York-based CFP and CEO of Family Wealth and Pension Management. The proposed higher capital gains levies are prompting tax-planning discussions. Foster said one charitable-giving strategy is donating stocks or funds that have gained value, known as "appreciated securities." This technique offers two tax benefits: a deduction for the asset's value and avoiding capital gains taxes on the growth. Depending on the final law, Weinberg said it may be better to give in 2022, when the higher taxes may go into effect. "If you're still able to donate appreciated securities next year, you get a bigger bang for your buck," he said. Foster said donors may give directly to charities or through so-called donor-advised funds, which act "like a charity checkbook." Donor-advised funds offer a tax deduction today while simplifying gifts to multiple organizations. Another technique, charitable trusts, may also be more appealing if Biden's plans go through. Weinberg recommends so-called charitable lead annuity trusts for high-net-worth clients. Depending on the structure of the trust, it may offer the donor a partial upfront tax deduction. These trusts offer payments to a charity for a set number of years, and once the term ends, the remaining assets may go to heirs. "This strategy may be even more valuable if and when the tax rates on capital gains and ordinary income rise," he said. Regardless of how tax laws change, Foster said it's critical to review trust documents. Successor trustees, who manage the trust after incapacity or death, may need flexibility when distributing assets to heirs or charities. He notes some trust documents aren't clear on the trustee's authority, which may be an issue as tax laws change. "I advocate for making [the trustee's authority] explicit and clear in the documents," he said.
Colonial Pipeline is now delivering millions of gallons of fuel each hour after a ransomware attack forced the company to shut its network last Friday. However, there are still widespread fuel shortages in several states. The cyberattack forced the company to shut down 5,500 miles of pipeline, triggering widespread fuel shortages in the Southeast and panic buying. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told NBC News on Thursday that Colonial paid almost $5 million as a ransom to the cybercriminals.	Colonial Pipeline has returned its entire system to normal operations and is delivering millions of gallons of fuel each hour after a ransomware attack forced the company shut its network last Friday. The company said Saturday that its pipeline is now servicing all markets, including Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, South and North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, D.C., Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. However, there are still widespread fuel shortages in many of those markets. In Washington, the nation's capital, 80% of gas stations are without fuel, according to the latest data from GasBuddy. In North Carolina 63% of stations are short, in Georgia and South Carolina more than 40%, and in Virginia 38%. The cyberattack had forced the company to shut down approximately 5,500 miles of pipeline and triggered widespread fuel shortages in the Southeast and panic buying in some states. Colonial carries nearly half of the fuel supply on the East Coast, including gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil and jet fuel. Colonial restarted operations around 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday but warned that the pipeline would not be fully functional immediately. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told NBC News on Thursday that Colonial paid almost $5 million as a ransom to the cybercriminals. It's unclear when the transaction occurred. The Department of Energy led the federal response to the attack — which was carried out by a cyber criminal group known as DarkSide — in coordination with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. Colonial said it will invest in the necessary resources to maintain safe and reliable pipeline operations. "Since this incident began, we have been clear that our focus was on the safe and efficient restoration of service to our pipeline system," Colonial said in a tweet. "That is what we have achieved through the commitment and dedication of the many Colonial team members." "Our team members across the pipeline worked safely and tirelessly around the clock to get our lines up and running, and we are grateful for their dedicated service and professionalism during these extraordinary times," the company said.
With the new subsidies and the limits the Covid-19 relief bill placed on health care costs, many are also paying much less for Obamacare plans than they have in the past. NBC News spoke to 16 people, eight of whom have signed up for Obamacare coverage or changed their plans since April 1 for greater savings, as well as advocates, doctors, insurance brokers and officials about the recent changes to the landmark health care regulation. Those who signed up, especially older people who did not yet qualify for Medicare, said they felt as though Obamacare was finally living up to their expectations.	Sheryl Hagen was earning $13.25 an hour after working more than five years at a Missouri grocery store. But even working full time, she couldn't afford the $300 premium for her employer's health insurance plan — so she went without. Earlier this year, Hagen, 51, broke her ribs and the resulting hospital stay led to a $1,300 bill. She didn't have enough to pay it, and taking time off to recover only put her further behind. "I couldn't move and couldn't work and couldn't really do anything," she said. "And then I knew I was going to have these giant bills coming at me. It was terrifying." That experience, an arthritic knee and a later doctor's visit had her looking into the special enrollment period for health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. With help, she was able to sign up for a marketplace plan for $73 per month. When President Joe Biden then signed the American Rescue Plan into law, which carries huge health care subsidies for the next two years , she reapplied and her premium was reduced to $0. "It's like a light at the end of the tunnel," said Hagen, who hasn't had health insurance in 12 years. "I'm blown away." Hagen is one of more than a million people who have signed up for Obamacare plans since the Biden administration opened up the special enrollment period, which began Feb. 15 and ends on Aug. 15. With the new subsidies and the limits the Covid-19 relief bill placed on health care costs, many are also paying much less for Obamacare plans than they have in the past. NBC News spoke to 16 people, eight of whom have signed up for Obamacare coverage or changed their plans since April 1 for greater savings, as well as advocates, doctors, insurance brokers and officials about the recent changes to the landmark health care regulation. Those who signed up, especially older people who did not yet qualify for Medicare, said they felt as though Obamacare was finally living up to their expectations. Jodi Smith, 62, paid $400 to $600 in monthly premiums for her Obamacare plans since she retired from a county government job in Tucson, Arizona, about 10 years ago. With the new subsidies, she now pays $175 per month, which she says has freed up her and her husband's household income. "It's what I kind of envisioned the ACA being when it was conceived," she said. "The first bunch of years, it ended up being more expensive. We finally have evolved to a point where it's working much better than it had been." The new subsidies provide tax credits to a larger number of enrollees and helps address the sudden ballooning costs some saw when their annual incomes varied. Experts and advocates said the uncertainty of the pandemic, in which many were laid off and lost their employee-provided health insurance and the resulting need for affordable health care has driven people to sign up. But the biggest reason that more than 1 million people have signed up, they said, is likely because of the promise of further savings. "The reality is that the Affordable Care Act priced too many people out of coverage," said Emily Stewart, the executive director of Community Catalyst, a left-leaning consumer health advocacy group. "And so when Congress and the Biden administration passed this policy to address that, I think that is the biggest driver of this surge that you're seeing." The number of those who have signed up for coverage also could be higher than 1 million, as the latest figures from the Department of Health and Human Services only covers the 36 states that use Healthcare.gov, the federal website. It does not account for those enrolling in the 14 states and Washington, D.C., that oversee their own markets — they are also able to take advantage of the new subsidies and many opened their own special enrollment period in response to the pandemic. "These 36 states have had, in essence, four years of drought, neglect and active efforts to, in essence, discourage enrollment," said Peter V. Lee, the executive director of California's health benefit exchange. "And now we've had a Biden administration that did marketing, that actually got the word out and affirmatively said, 'If people are uninsured, they should know they've got options.' They've also added what I would call fertilizer, which is the new subsidies from the American Rescue Plan." The Biden administration has invested $100 million into Affordable Care Act marketing and $80 million into nonprofit navigator programs that help individuals sign up for health care coverage. Much of that funding was stripped away under President Donald Trump. Lee said that California has also seen a bump in enrollment, although it's not as sizable as the federal spike because the state consistently put high levels of funding into marketing and navigation programs. But Lee noted that the subsidies have been a huge boon in helping low-income workers who don't qualify for Medicaid to afford health care coverage. It's also been an aid to others by capping the amount people pay at 8.5 percent of their income. "It really is a sea change," he said. The White House agrees, though they face a fair amount of work to make those subsidies permanent. As it stands, they expire within two years. Christen Linke Young, the deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council for Health and Veterans Affairs, said the Biden administration remains committed to ensuring the subsidies become permanent. "The subsidies in the American Rescue Plan are a meaningful victory for American families," she said. "The president's been clear he wants to see that continue, and we very much look forward to working with Congress to get that done." They do have more political capital to work with these days. Opinions of the Affordable Care Act have changed significantly since the law's passage and implementation. At the height of its unpopularity, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll, 53 percent of people viewed Obamacare unfavorably and 37 percent held a favorable view. That number has practically flipped with 54 percent now favorable of the health care law and 39 percent unfavorable. "You don't need to like President Biden or like President Obama or like Obamacare to find it attractive to buy an affordable health insurance product," Young said. Many said they were shocked by how much they were saving after they re-enrolled in their Obamacare plan. April Henry, an Oregon-based mystery writer who formerly worked in the health care industry, said she and her husband are saving $700 a month on their premiums after they signed back up after April 1. She said the two of them could now save more for retirement and help their 25-year-old daughter with upcoming dental surgery. "It's huge. It's so much money," she said. "I was really shocked at how much it was going to be." To reach more people, however, Obamacare still has a difficult history it must overcome: Many still remember it as overpriced and limiting. "One of the big issues with the ACA was that people who earned more than 400 percent of the federal poverty level would immediately lose their tax credit," said Carolyn McClanahan, a doctor and financial planner in Jacksonville, Florida. "People were owing back thousands and thousands of dollars, and that gave the ACA a really bad rap. But now the tax credits are phased out instead of all of a sudden just being gone." Kenneth Smith, 62, lives outside of Pittsburgh and works construction and occasionally as a truck driver. He said he decided to sign up for the Affordable Care Act at the hospital when he was rushed there for diabetic shock this year. Smith is still waiting for those hospital bills, but he admitted that he long had a skeptical view of the coverage provided through Obamacare. "From what I heard, it was garbage, it was unaffordable, and it was dumped down your throat — you had to take it or you paid a fine," he said. Before he was hospitalized, Smith said he had maxed out his credit card on a short-term "junk insurance plan" that did not cover any of his hospital bills. After his hospitalization, because of the subsidies, he said he was able to obtain a plan that he could afford and cost half as much as the one offered by his employer. "The insurance is fantastic," he said. "The two medications I'm on were 100 percent covered." While many appear to be enjoying the new affordability of Obamacare, the White House still faces many questions and challenges. Chief among them is the current expiration date on subsidies. "The most important thing to remember is that these new affordability policies are temporary," Stewart said. "They are only put in place for two years. It's really essential that they are made permanent." The White House intends to do just that and has attached the subsidies to the president's proposed American Families Plan, a $1.8 trillion investment in education, child care and paid family leave. But with a razor-thin majority in Congress, the Biden administration will face a challenge to get that package, as well as a massive infrastructure bill, through either chamber. There is also a feeling of whiplash on health care for some — especially between the Republican and Democratic administrations. Jenny Chumbley Hogue, who runs an insurance agency north of Dallas, said she has signed up a number of people, some who have never had coverage before. She said many are deeply conservative and critical of Obamacare. "There's a lot of, in general, people not believing it's going to be around," said Hogue. "I've definitely gotten a couple of comments of, 'Well in two years, this is going to go right back up.'"
President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden earned $607,336 in 2020, according to their newly released tax return, a significant drop from their 2019 income. The return also shows that the Bidens paid $157,414 in federal income tax, a rate of 25.9%. Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, reported $1,695,225 in gross income, and paid $621,893 in federal income tax, a rate of 36.7%.	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden earned $607,336 in 2020, according to their newly released tax return , a significant drop from their 2019 income that reflects Joe Biden's singular focus on campaigning for president last year. The return shows that the Bidens paid $157,414 in federal income tax, a rate of 25.9%. The Bidens also made $30,704 in charitable contributions. According to the president's 2020 financial disclosure form , which was also released on Monday, he and Jill Biden have assets of between $1.2 million and $2.88 million. The tax return released Monday shows that Joe Biden's income fell by more than $300,000 last year, as he stopped doing lucrative speaking engagements in order to campaign. In 2019, the Bidens reported making $944,737 in taxable income, and paid $299,346 in federal income taxes on it, or a 31% tax rate. At the time, the Bidens' 2019 income represented a significant decrease from the two years before that. In 2017, the couple reported making more than $11 million, and in 2018 they made $4.5 million. In both years, their income was largely the result of book deals. As president, Joe Biden will make $400,000 in 2021, in addition to any royalties on his books and other income, like interest. The White House also released Vice President Kamala Harris's tax return on Monday, which was the federal income tax deadline this year. Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, reported $1,695,225 in gross income. They reported paying $621,893 in federal income tax, a rate of 36.7%. Harris and Emhoff contributed $27,000 to charity in 2020. Emhoff is a partner at DLA Piper, but he announced in August of last year that he was taking a leave of absence from the law firm. As president, Joe Biden has proposed tax hikes on corporations and the wealthiest Americans in order to pay for a sweeping infrastructure improvement plan and a series of spending programs that would strengthen the social safety net and expand free education. Under his proposed plan, both the Bidens and Harris and Emhoff would see their taxes go up, if their incomes remained at these levels. The president has made tax fairness a cornerstone of his economic agenda, and he often points out how much benefit the United States could see from nominally increased taxes on corporations and the wealthy, and enhanced IRS enforcement of current tax laws. "Do we want to give the wealthiest people in America another tax cut, or do you want to give every high school graduate the ability to earn a community college degree?" Joe Biden said earlier this month at a speech in Norfolk, Va. His administration's domestic spending plan would make two years of community college free to high school graduates, and fund universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds. "It is paid for by making sure corporate America and the wealthiest 1% just pay their fair share," he said. Joe Biden's release of tax returns follows four years during which former President Donald Trump kept his tax returns a secret, breaking with decades of presidential precedent. In the announcement Monday, the White House said Joe Biden was "continuing an almost uninterrupted tradition" by releasing his return, a clear jab at Trump. By contrast, said the White House, Joe Biden "has shared a total of 23 years of tax returns with the American public."
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris released their 2020 tax returns on Monday, rekindling the yearly presidential tradition. The Bidens reported $607,336 in income and paid $157,414 in federal taxes, putting them in the top 1% of filers, according to IRS data. While there were no financial bombshells, tax experts point out a few intriguing details.	President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris released their 2020 tax returns Monday, restoring the annual White House tradition. The president and first lady Jill Biden reported $607,336 in adjusted gross income, putting them in the top 1% of filers, according to IRS data . The Bidens paid $157,414 in federal taxes, a rate of 25.9%. Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff, an attorney, reported $1,695,225 in adjusted gross income. They paid $621,893 in federal taxes, a 36.7% rate. Biden and Harris also shared financial disclosures for 2020. More from Personal Finance: New monthly child tax credit payments start July 15. What to know How Biden's tax plan may spark more charitable giving Biden's plan to beef up IRS audits may target wealthy small business owners The Bidens revealed joint assets valued between $1.2 million and nearly $2.9 million, while Harris and Emhoff's assets are worth between $3 million and nearly $7 million. "Overall, they're pretty clean," said Karl Schwartz, certified financial planner and certified public accountant at Team Hewins in Boca Raton, Florida. While the returns didn't unveil any financial bombshells, tax experts say a few details are worth noting. While a large chunk of the Bidens' income came from pensions, they also received $200,000 in wages through their company, structured as an S-corporation. "There are ways of mitigating your tax when you have your own corp like that," said Eric Pierre, an Austin, Texas-based certified public accountant and owner at Pierre Accounting. These so-called pass-through businesses may allow owners to avoid self-employment taxes on part of their company income. The Biden's S-corporation provided significant tax savings in 2017 and 2018 . Most of Harris and Emhoff's income came from Emhoff's work as a partner at his law firm, DLA Piper. With incomes well over the $400,000 threshold, both couples may be impacted by Biden's proposed tax hikes. Capital gains levies may be less of a concern, however. Neither return had significant capital gains income, Pierre said. Another striking detail is how much each couple spent on state and local taxes, Pierre said. The Bidens had $90,289 in state and local taxes, or SALT, but couldn't claim a deduction for more than $10,000. The same $10,000 limit applied to Harris and Emhoff, who racked up a whopping $280,421 in state and local taxes. This so-called $10,000 SALT deduction cap was a last-minute addition to former President Donald Trump's signature tax overhaul in 2017. Before the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, filers could deduct their full amount of SALT, a massive write-off for high-tax areas. "That's a pretty substantial deduction that's being taken away," Schwartz said. The administration hasn't called for ending the Trump-era $10,000 cap on state and local taxes, but the first and second families would significantly benefit from the change. Repealing the $10,000 SALT deduction cap has become a sticking point among lawmakers in high-tax states, threatening to derail Biden's American Families Plan. Ditching the SALT deduction cap may not help most Americans, however. Fewer than 10% of households would benefit, with 96% of the tax cut going to the top 20%, according to the Tax Policy Center .
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday that a laboratory origin of Covid-19 is "one possibility." But most coronaviruses "generally come from an animal origin," Walensky said in a Senate hearing. The remarks from the top Biden administration health official came amid growing calls to investigate the origins of the virus.	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Wednesday did not discount that Covid-19 could have originated in a laboratory, saying it "certainly" was "one possibility." Most coronaviruses, however, "generally come from an animal origin," Walensky said in Senate testimony after saying she had not seen enough data to give her opinion on how the current pandemic originated. The remarks from the top Biden administration health official came amid growing calls to investigate whether the virus had zoonotic, or animal, origins or came from a lab in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization said in a report in March that it was "extremely unlikely" that the virus was introduced to humans through an accidental lab leak. But that conclusion has been heavily criticized, and other scientists have since come forward calling for more investigation. "Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable," said a letter from 18 scientists published in the journal Science last week. Other scientists have criticized that letter for drawing a false equivalence between the likelihood of a lab leak versus a natural-origin scenario, The New York Times reported . The CDC's website currently says that while the exact source of the outbreak is unknown, "we know that it originally came from an animal, likely a bat." Covid-19 was first detected in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China. The origin of the virus has increasingly become a hotly discussed topic in American politics as well. In Wednesday's hearing on the CDC's budget for the next fiscal year starting Oct. 1, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., asked Walensky for her opinion on where the pandemic started. "I don't believe I've seen enough data, individual data for me to be able to comment on that," Walensky said. Asked what the possibilities are, Walensky said, "Certainly the possibilities of, that most coronaviruses that we know of are of origin from, that have infected the population — SARS CoV-1, MERS — generally come from an animal origin." Kennedy responded: "Are there any other possibilities?" "Certainly a lab-based origin is one possibility," Walensky said. Covid-19 grew into a pandemic in March 2020 . The virus has now infected more than 164 million and killed more than 3.4 million people worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University . Robert Redfield, the former CDC director who worked on the U.S. response to the pandemic under ex-President Donald Trump, said in March he believes the coronavirus originated in a Wuhan lab.
The tax gap is estimated to be about $7 trillion over the next decade, according to a Treasury Department report issued Thursday. Around 80% of the gap is from underreported income, largely from "opaque" income sources like proprietorships and partnerships among the wealthy, the Treasury said. President Joe Biden wants to increase tax compliance from the rich to raise revenue for his American Families Plan.	President Joe Biden is calling for a crackdown on rich taxpayers who avoid taxes by hiding a big chunk of their income from the IRS. Tax compliance is among the many ways Biden is seeking to raise tax revenue from households earning more than $400,000 a year to fund the American Families Plan. The legislation would boost spending for initiatives like expanded education, child care and paid leave. Underreported income, largely among the wealthy, is the biggest contributor to the so-called tax gap, according to a Treasury Department report issued Thursday. The Treasury estimates improved tax collection would raise $700 billion over the next decade. More from Personal Finance: Taxes would likely rise for the wealthy regardless of Biden's plans What we learned from Biden, Harris 2020 tax returns How to reduce the taxes you will pay on retirement accounts The tax gap is the difference between tax paid and tax owed. It was estimated to be $584 billion in 2019 and $7 trillion over the next decade, according to the Treasury. Around 80% of the tax gap comes from underreported income — much of which is due to "opaque income sources that accrue disproportionately to higher earners," the Treasury said. It identifies certain nonlabor income — from businesses like partnerships and proprietorships as well as rental income, for example. In such categories, individuals underreport roughly 55% of their income, according to the department. That means more than half their income, on average, isn't being taxed. "We don't know the extent to which it's intentional or unintentional. But it is high," Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said. That share is much higher than with other income sources. Employees who earn a salary or wages misreport about 1% of their income, for example. The difference comes down to third-party reporting, tax experts said. Employers file an employee's job income each year on a W-2, which is distributed to the taxpayer and the IRS. In this case, the employer serves as a third-party verification. (Employees also have tax withheld from their paychecks over the course of the year.) The same concept is true for investment income. Financial institutions would report a taxpayer's dividend income on a 1099-DIV tax form, for example. But there's little or no third-party verification with certain business entities, according to tax experts. Sole proprietors, for example, self-report their income and expenses to the IRS. In a partnership, any underreported income at the firm level trickles down to the individual returns of the business partners, Holtzblatt said. (The IRS has devoted more resources to auditing partnerships in recent years, however, she added.) "A self-reporting system has its own inherent flaws," said Leon LaBrecque, an accountant and certified financial planner at Sequoia Financial Group. "And there's not an easy way around it." This doesn't only apply to high earners, though, LaBrecque said. The same concept applies to a restaurant worker or bartender who doesn't report cash tips as income, for example. But the IRS can accrue more tax revenue by cracking down on the wealthy who underreport income, he added. Biden's tax plan calls for a strengthening of third-party reporting to the IRS, which the administration says is among the most effective ways to improve tax compliance. It also seeks $80 billion in IRS funding over the next decade, partly to hire agents who can conduct complex tax audits on the wealthy and complicated business structures. The plan would overhaul IRS technology systems and increase penalties for tax evaders.
U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korean President Moon Jae-in meet in Washington on Friday. Moon is seeking Biden's help on securing Covid vaccines as cases rise in South Korea, said Victor Cha, a professor and vice dean at Georgetown University. Ho-young Ahn, South Korean ambassador to the U.S. from 2013 to 2017, said the Biden-Moon summit is "unique" as the leaders would spend more time discussing issues other than North Korea.	South Korean President Moon Jae-in will be seeking U.S. President Joe Biden's help on securing Covid vaccines when the leaders meet in Washington on Friday, according to one foreign policy expert. "I think the South Koreans have put a very big emphasis on vaccine diplomacy as being the big deliverable of this summit," Victor Cha, a professor and vice dean at Georgetown University, told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Friday. The meeting with Moon will be Biden's second in-person summit with a leader of a foreign country. He met Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga in Washington last month. Domestic pressure has mounted on Moon to push for faster deliveries of vaccines as rising Covid cases have forced authorities to extend social-distancing measures multiple times. Moon has pledged to reach "herd immunity" by November, but a global shortage of vaccines threatens his pledge. Herd immunity happens when enough people in the population are vaccinated or infected, and the disease can no longer spread wildly. Around 7% of the South Korean population has received at least one vaccine, according to data by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. South Korea on Friday approved Moderna 's Covid vaccine — the fourth approval after giving the green light to those developed by AstraZeneca , Pfizer - BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson , Reuters reported. The shortage of vaccines comes as infections rise over the past month. South Korean authorities on Friday extended social-distancing measures for three more weeks given that daily cases are still high. The country has reported more than 134,600 confirmed cases of Covid since the start of last year, with 1,922 deaths. The urgency to secure supplies of Covid vaccines would likely overshadow any efforts by Moon to revive talks on North Korea. "I think President Moon obviously is more interested in moving quickly on North Korea given that he has less than a year left in his time in office," said Cha, who was director of Asian affairs at the White House National Security Council from 2004 to 2007 and is senior vice president and Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He said Biden is "not against" diplomacy with North Korea, but the administration already has a lot on its plate, including tensions in the Middle East and the strategic competition with China. Furthermore, North Korea doesn't appear keen on dialogue right now with the country remaining in lockdown due to the pandemic, said Cha. Still, Moon and Biden are likely to signal that they're in "complete alignment" on issues surrounding North Korea, Cha added. Ahn Ho-young, South Korean ambassador to the U.S. from 2013 to 2017, agreed the summit could cover issues other than North Korea. Ahn told CNBC's "Capital Connection" on Friday that during his time in Washington, U.S. and South Korean leaders spent much of time discussing North Korea-related issues. "I think this summit meeting is rather unique ... because this time I think, we expect our leaders to discuss more, spend more of their time on such issues like vaccines or batteries or semiconductors," he said. "There are so many things we could be doing together between Korea and the United States."
World leaders welcomed the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, but Israeli former Justice Minister Yossi Beilin has expressed skepticism. Israel's security Cabinet approved a tentative cease-fire brokered by Egypt following this month's violence. The death toll from Israeli airstrikes in Gaza rose to more than 240 after 11 days of fighting, while at least 12 people in Israel were killed by Hamas rockets.	World leaders have welcomed the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, but an Israeli former justice minister has expressed skepticism over whether the truce will hold up over time. Yossi Beilin told CNBC's "Capital Connection" on Friday that every few years, the two sides end up exchanging fire. That stops after a number of days with both sides declaring victory, he said. "Then, after a few years, we get back to shoot each other," he said. "It is really very frustrating, and the question of who won, who lost, is really totally marginal." The death toll from Israeli airstrikes in Gaza rose to more than 240 after 11 days of fighting , while at least 12 people in Israel were killed by Hamas rockets. Israel's security Cabinet on Thursday approved a tentative cease-fire brokered by Egypt following this month's violence, which has been the worst escalation since 2014. U.S. President Joe Biden said Egypt informed him that Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, and other groups in Gaza had also agreed to the truce. Beilin appeared unconvinced that the cease-fire could be different from others that have come before. "Why should it be different?" he said. Beilin held multiple roles in the government over the years, and served as minister of justice from July 1999 to March 2001 under then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Beilin acknowledged that Egypt has helped a lot so far, but said the U.S. should help Israel and the Palestinians solve the long-term conflict. According to White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, Washington had over 60 calls with senior leaders in Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the region. Biden said his administration will continue its "quiet relentless diplomacy" to help Palestinians and Israelis live safely and securely with "equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and democracy." Beilin said the issue between Israel and the Palestinian territories had not been "not very high" on Washington's agenda since the situation had been quiet. Now, however, it has "exploded in our faces," he said. "I think that it will — and it should — help us in trying to solve the real problem between Israel and the Palestinian Authority," he said, referring to Washington. "We, by now, know all the solutions for all the outstanding issues on Jerusalem and the refugees and the borders and the settlements, what we have to do is just to sit down and to have the courage to compromise," said Beilin. U.S. intervention may have been less important when former Israeli leaders "wanted very much" to solve the problem and partition the land, he said. "But this is not the case today," he said. "The case today is that the two parties are either weak or unwilling to negotiate with each other, and there is a need to encourage them to move."
Assaults and harassment against Asian Americans, a group comprising some 23 million people in the U.S., have brought AAPI issues to the national stage for the first time since the murder of Vincent Chin in 1982. Asian Americans in banking are now connecting with co-workers in virtual chatrooms, over Zoom and in person to commiserate about being Asian in finance, and in America. "They thought they were part of the mainstream until this 'Chinese virus' stuff," Wall Street recruiter Mike Karp said of his Asian American clients. "Now there's a building resentment that people have, and they aren't taking it anymore."	A year after the pandemic began in New York City, something snapped in Alex Chi . The 48-year-old Goldman Sachs banker had been inundated with articles and video clips of horrifying, seemingly random attacks on Asian Americans in his home town. Then, in late March, eight people were gunned down in the Atlanta area — most of them immigrants from Korea and China — and Chi could stand it no longer. The barrage of attacks forced a change in Chi, a partner and 27-year Goldman veteran. He became an in-house agitator of sorts, attending protests and rallying his colleagues around a simple idea: Silence is no longer an option. "The message I've clearly put out to other Asian Americans is this: You have to start speaking up for yourselves," Chi said in a recent interview. "We have to use this moment as an opportunity to finally make ourselves heard and change the narrative around Asian Americans in this country." This isn't just the story of the political awakening of a single New York banker. It's the story of thousands of Wall Street employees who are, many for the first time in their lives, connecting with co-workers in virtual chatrooms, over Zoom and in person to commiserate about being Asian in finance, and in America. While Asian Americans make up one of the biggest minority groups in finance, comprising roughly 15% of the employees at the six biggest U.S. banks, few have made it to the operating committees of these institutions. Just one, former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit, has led a top-tier bank. Chi, who became a Goldman partner a decade ago, reaching one of Wall Street's loftiest ranks, says he is one of the first Korean Americans to do so at the 151-year-old institution. He believes Asian Americans at Goldman and beyond are now pushing back against the stereotype —rooted in a common cultural upbringing that stresses modesty and conflict avoidance and reinforced at times by workplace discrimination — that they are quiet, docile worker bees. For the broader community, some 23 million people, the past few months have been the first time Asian American issues have reached the national stage in decades. The last time this has happened was probably in the early 1980s, when the beating death of Vincent Chin galvanized an earlier generation to form affinity groups, according to historians. The arrival of the coronavirus last year brought a surge in bias crimes against Asian Americans, especially in New York and California. Many of the assaults have been against senior citizens and women . The violence has shattered the sense of security for many in the group, according to the Pew Research Center. But a silver lining to the racial scapegoating that accompanied Covid-19 has been that it has unified many Americans of Asian descent, the fastest-growing minority group in the U.S. They make up a significant portion of the corporate workforce in industries including finance, technology and health care, and are an emerging force in politics. "There's so many differences within Asians, but you're treated as one group," said Joyce Chang , chair of global research at JPMorgan Chase . "Now, being targeted for hate crimes, people are saying, we are being treated like a monolith, we may as well get organized." Chang says she studied the history of anti-Asian sentiment in the U.S. while at Columbia University in the 1980s, including the vicious 1982 killing of Chin by two bat-wielding Detroit autoworkers who mistakenly assumed he was Japanese. The killers, who blamed Japan for the decline of the U.S. auto industry, were fined $3,000 and avoided prison. Chang said the current period reminds her of that time. Both for the larger issues — in the 1980s, anxiety over Japanese economic might was common, while today the emergence of China as a global superpower has policymakers worried — as well as the response. The first use of the phrase "China virus'' by former President Donald Trump on Twitter in March 2020 led directly to an increase in online and offline anti-Asian abuse, according to a recent report in the American Journal of Public Health. Trump had nearly 90 million followers before getting booted from the platform. Now, people are forming pan-Asian affinity groups to help keep track of the bias attacks and boost philanthropy. One such nonprofit, the Asian American Foundation, launched this month and said it has already raised $125 million for AAPI causes over the next five years. It, along with JPMorgan and other organizations, have given money to Stop AAPI Hate , a new group that began tracking bias attacks in January 2020 after a rash of incidents in California. Initially, it was journalists in New York and San Francisco who chronicled the attacks, which began in the early days of the pandemic and ramped up this year, occurring on a daily basis at times. Then Asian American celebrities including actors and athletes amplified the coverage. Posts on social media brought home the idea that even being famous and powerful didn't insulate people from feeling vulnerable. The movement has extended to the finance realm . At JPMorgan, Chang says that after the Atlanta shootings, attendance at an internal forum for Asian Americans had 6,100 participants, about 10 times larger than the typical attendance before the pandemic. The sentiment of many of those I spoke with was something akin to shock. Several had had superlative careers on Wall Street, and yet here they were, reliving some of the same trauma from their childhoods they had believed was a thing of the past. Tom Lee , co-founder of research boutique Fundstrat and a regular CNBC on-air guest, said he faced "merciless anti-Asian attacks" growing up in a small town 25 miles from Detroit. That tough childhood helped him chart his own course as one of the best-known market prognosticators in the country, he said, because he had learned to tune out noise. "It's been easy to feel like Asians have a bit of a bull's-eye on their backs," Lee said in an interview. Mike Karp, CEO of Options Group, a recruiting firm that has placed thousands of traders and salespeople on Wall Street in the past three decades, put it a different way. "They thought they were part of the mainstream until this 'Chinese virus' stuff," Karp, who is Indian American, said of his AAPI clients. "Now there's a building resentment that people have, and they aren't taking it anymore." Distress over the violence she was seeing in San Francisco and the initial lack of national media attention moved Cynthia Sugiyama, a senior vice president at Wells Fargo, to publish a highly personal piece in March. Sugiyama says she has been overwhelmed by the response to her column , published in the San Francisco Chronicle and LinkedIn, from colleagues and others who related to her experiences being harassed as a child, and her resolve to respond to the current moment. "I've never before felt this sense of community as much as now," Sugiyama said. "What makes this moment pivotal is that the surge in anti-Asian sentiment on one side has been met with a powerful swell on the other side from Asian Americans who are finding their voices." Sugiyama, who manages human resources communications for a company of 264,513 employees, said that Asian American employees have flocked to internal forums to share their feelings and experiences. According to employees at some of the biggest banks, one of the main topics being discussed is the difficulty Asian Americans have climbing the corporate ladder. The Wall Street model is to take in thousands of college graduates a year, placing them on the bottom of a hierarchy where analysts and associates grind out long hours in support of merger deals or trading activity. By design, few junior bankers make it to the vice president or director level, where annual compensation typically reaches several hundred thousand dollars. Fewer still make it to managing director, where pay packages often total more than $1 million a year. For instance, at JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, about 25,000 employees identify themselves as Asian. While roughly 1 in 4 of the bank's professional workers are Asian, just 10% are senior managers. At the very top of the organization, the bank's 18-person operating committee led by CEO Jamie Dimon includes just one Asian person, Sanoke Viswanathan. Some have had the realization that the playbook used by Asian Americans to reach a certain level of workplace achievement isn't enough anymore. "Every bank is happy to hire a young Asian who will work double hard and is good at math and analysis," said a Morgan Stanley employee who asked for anonymity to speak candidly. "As time goes on however, I noticed how most of the people I knew in Wall Street never really progressed past VP level, and many were laid off when cost-cutting rounds came." His explanation for this phenomenon is two-fold: Parents of Asian Americans drilled a set of principles into their children — study, work hard — that gets you past the first few hurdles at an investment bank, but that doesn't necessarily help people advance beyond that. Further, little emphasis is given to so-called soft skills like public speaking and finding mentors, things needed at higher levels, he said. Some corners of Wall Street are friendlier for Asian Americans than others, he said. When it comes to stock research, people only care if an analyst makes them money, he said. With mergers advice, however, the client is always right, and sometimes owners of mid-sized and small companies didn't want to work with nonwhite bankers, he said. In wealth management, Asian Americans often don't have the social connections to help them succeed. And, just as with Black and Latinx employees, Asian Americans are hindered because managers are more likely to support and promote people who look like themselves, he said. Lee, the Fundstrat co-founder, said that in his 24 years on Wall Street before striking out on his own, he often saw the careers of Asian Americans stall. What hampers them from progressing is an aversion to drawing attention to themselves and the clubby nature of banking at higher levels, he said. "I've seen that the most successful people are the ones who do a bit of bragging," Lee said. "Asians aren't really good at that, and I think that hurts us, because it's easy to not realize someone has a lot to offer if they aren't bragging about it." Despite the general success of the cohort in the corporate setting, Lee says, Asian Americans haven't been involved enough in other areas of civic life, especially politics. That may be changing, however. Kamala Harris , who is of Indian-Jamaican heritage, became the first Asian American, Black and female vice president, and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang is a front-runner for New York mayor. Asian American voters were a key constituency in the last presidential election, casting a record number of votes in states where President Joe Biden eked out narrow victories. Still, some of the Asian Americans interviewed for this story said they felt invisible at work. Or worse, given the spike in harassment and violence, some felt like permanent foreigners despite having lived in the U.S. for decades. Most Americans can't name a single prominent living Asian American, according to a recent survey . Part of what has hamstrung an Asian American political movement is that the construct itself has always been an imperfect solution, a term created in the late 1960 s to consolidate smaller cohorts to gain leverage amid the wider Civil Rights movement. Today, the term Asian American includes people from more than 20 countries across East and South Asia, each with their own languages, food and culture. People who have familial roots in China, India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Korea and Japan make up about 85% of all Asian Americans. In fact, the presence of most Asians in the U.S. can be traced to the Civil Rights movement, which established that a race-based system of laws was unjust. After an initial wave of immigration to the continental U.S. in the 1850s, Asians were seen as a "yellow peril" and explicitly excluded from coming to the U.S. for nearly a century by laws including the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. That changed after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 opened up migration from Asia, Southern Europe and Africa, instead of solely favoring Western and Northern Europeans. The law would forever change the complexion of the country and happened only after the Civil Rights Act by President Lyndon Johnson. When Johnson signed the landmark immigration legislation in 1965, he was quoted as saying that the previous system "violated the basic principle of American democracy, the principle that values and rewards each man on the basis of his merit." Back at Goldman Sachs, Chi realized he had a part to play after the horror of the Atlanta shootings, at least within the confines of his 40,300-person firm. Some managers hadn't been aware of the violence against Asian Americans, particularly in public areas like subway platforms. Now, amid the company's push to encourage more employees to return to Goldman's headquarters in lower Manhattan, workers were speaking up, telling managers that they didn't feel safe. Employees got permission to expense rideshares for their commute, and the bank invited public safety experts to offer advice, Chi said. "In the past, they would've just sucked it up and done what they needed to do," Chi said. "Now, our Asian American community here is speaking up, and they're going to their managers and saying, 'I'm not comfortable. Have you seen what's going on?'" Chi also reached out directly to CEO David Solomon , who quickly set up a roundtable meeting where he listened to senior Asian American executives air their concerns. When Solomon shared a photo of the event on social media and the bank's internal homepage, it opened up the firm to many more discussions where managers acknowledged they hadn't known what their Asian American employees were going through, Chi said. "When I walked out of that room with one of my partners, we turned to each other and said, 'Wow, this is a seminal moment, because here we are with our CEO, talking very openly about Asian American issues,' " Chi said. "That's never happened before."
President Joe Biden on Friday rejected his predecessor's approach to North Korea and its nuclear program. Biden used the example of former President Donald Trump's high-profile meetings with Kim Jong-Un to illustrate what he, as president, would never do. Biden also announced that the United States would provide 550,000 South Korean service members with Covid-19 vaccines.	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Friday rejected his predecessor's approach to North Korea and said his goal as president was to achieve a "total denuclearization" of the Korean Peninsula. Speaking at a joint press conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Biden used the example of former President Donald Trump's high-profile meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un to illustrate what he, Biden, would never do. "If there was a commitment on which we met, then I would meet with [Kim]," said Biden. "And the commitment has to be that there is discussion about his nuclear arsenal." "What I would not do is what has been done in the recent past," the president said. "I would not give him all he's looking for, international recognition as legitimate, and give him what allowed him to move in a direction of appearing to be more serious about what he wasn't at all serious about." Trump held three high-profile meetings with Kim, one in Singapore in June of 2018, another in Hanoi the following February, and the last one in June of 2019. During their third meeting, Trump took several steps onto North Korean soil, becoming the first American president to do so. All three meetings between Trump and Kim were ostensibly focused on denuclearization. Yet rather than reduce his stockpile, Kim doubled his country's arsenal of nuclear weapons during the four years Trump was president. Biden and Moon pledged to work together to continue the effort to denuclearize North Korea. As part of this process, Biden announced Friday that Ambassador Sung Kim will serve as the U.S. special envoy for North Korea. Sung Kim is a career diplomat and a former ambassador to South Korea. He was recently nominated to be the assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. Another important topic during Biden and Moon's meeting on Friday was their countries' ongoing response to Covid-19. South Korea is currently experiencing a shortage of coronavirus vaccines . Approximately 7% of South Koreans have received at least one shot of the vaccine, according to data by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. By contrast, more than 48% of Americans have received one shot, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During the press conference, Moon and Biden announced that the United States would provide 550,000 Korean service members with Covid-19 vaccines. Biden and Moon's press conference followed an afternoon of meetings and ceremonies, including the awarding of the Presidential Medal of Honor to a U.S. veteran of the Korean War. The visit was Biden's second time as president hosting a foreign leader at the White House. And it offered the president an opportunity to showcase that, in his words, "America is back." After four years of Trump's isolationist approach to foreign policy, Moon welcomed the new tone. "The world is welcoming America's return and keeping their hopes high for America's leadership more than ever before," Moon said Friday. But foreign policy is not where Biden has devoted the lion's share of his attention as president. Aides to the president say he is chiefly focused on enacting his domestic agenda: two massive proposals, to rebuild the nation's infrastructure and to fund a range of family and social services. As the past week has shown, however, events on the ground can quickly force any White House to shift its attention overseas. Most recently, renewed fighting between Israel and the Islamic militant group Hamas in Gaza consumed much of the attention of the world during the past 11 days. Biden said Friday that a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is "the only answer." And despite pressure from some Democrats to take a harder line on Israel's airstrikes, Biden emphasized that nothing in his approach to the longtime U.S. ally has changed. "There is no shift in my commitment to the security of Israel. Period." He also praised Egypt's president, Abdel Al-Sisi, for doing what Biden said was a "commendable job" securing the cooperation of Hamas on a cease-fire that began early Friday morning.
"We are on the right track and some progress has been made, but this does not mean that the talks in Vienna have reached the final stage," an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Negotiations are starting to pick up pace, even as Iran announces further violations of the deal — most significantly its pledge last week to begin enriching uranium to 60% purity.	Talks on the Iranian nuclear deal in Vienna hit more positive notes on Monday, officials said, as Tehran and Washington continue indirect negotiations in the hope of reviving the 2015 accord that lifted economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs to its nuclear program. "We are on the right track and some progress has been made, but this does not mean that the talks in Vienna have reached the final stage," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh told a news conference in Tehran. U.S. officials say there has been no breakthrough, but have described the indirect discussions as "thorough" and "thoughtful." Reports say diplomats may even draft an interim deal that would give all sides more time to resolve some of the more complicated technical issues. Negotiations are starting to pick up pace, even as Iran announces further violations of the deal — most significantly its pledge last week to begin enriching uranium to 60% purity, which would bring the fissile material closer to levels required for a bomb. Uranium enrichment needs to be at 90% in order to make a bomb — the limit under the 2015 deal was 3.67%. The move are "violations Iran is trying to turn into leverage at the negotiations in Vienna," Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told CNBC. While this move is aimed at strengthening Tehran's hand, it could also backfire, analysts warn. Iran on April 10 launched advanced centrifuges for enriching uranium to mark its national "Nuclear Day" while its President Hassan Rouhani reiterated the country's commitment to nuclear non-proliferation. The conflicting messages on state television were followed by an explosion at Iran's Natanz enrichment facility just one day later — which Tehran has called an "act of nuclear terrorism" and blamed on Israel. Israel publicly declined to confirm or deny any responsibility. "I think this will definitely drag out, you're likely to see the cyber war heat up between these two countries in the next few months and we're likely to see more talk of talking in the next few months," Ben Taleblu said. "And in the meantime, while there are more cyberattacks and more talking, you can almost guarantee that sites like Natanz will be doing everything they can to continue producing." Still, all parties continue to seek a U.S. return to the deal that the former Trump administration abandoned in 2018, after which it imposed crippling sanctions on Iran's economy. The U.S. also wants to see Iran return to full compliance before it lifts sanctions, something that gets trickier with each new enrichment push by Tehran. Throughout the talks Iranian officials have essentially taken a hardline approach — they want Washington to lift all sanctions before it returns to compliance. The Biden team has expressed willingness to remove all sanctions that are inconsistent with the accord, but it hasn't exactly spelled out what that means yet. Officials on all sides have described a mutual desire to move toward simultaneous and sequential steps to get this deal over the line. But at this point, there is still significantly more work to be done. At same time, the International Atomic Energy Agency has started separate talks with Iran on uranium traces that the agency found at undeclared locations in the country. The agency wants to understand where the traces came from and ensure that Iran is not diverting the material to make a nuclear weapon, which would mark a major blow to the apparent progress of the talks so far. Iran is insisting that that is not the case. The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said Monday, "I think that both parties are really interested in reaching an agreement, and they have been moving from general to more focused issues, which are clearly, on one side sanction-lifting, and on the other side, nuclear implementation issues." "The U.S. rejoining the JCPOA and a return to the full implementation of the deal would make the world much safer," Borrell said.
The country's 111-page Integrated Defense Review, published Tuesday, included a subtle line on when the U.K. "reserves the right" to use nuclear weapons. It says the U.K. could use nuclear weapons if other countries use "weapons of mass destruction" against it. Such weapons include "emerging technologies that could have a comparable impact" to chemical, biological weapons or other nuclear weapons.	LONDON — The U.K. has changed its defense policy which may enable it to use nuclear weapons in response to "emerging technologies." The country's 111-page Integrated Defense Review , published Tuesday, included a subtle line on when the U.K. "reserves the right" to use nuclear weapons. It says the U.K. could use nuclear weapons if other countries use "weapons of mass destruction" against it. Such weapons include "emerging technologies that could have a comparable impact" to chemical, biological weapons or other nuclear weapons. Some British newspapers report that "emerging technologies" include cyberattacks, citing defense insiders, but the report doesn't explicitly say that. The U.K. government did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. Tom Plant, a director at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, told CNBC: "I would not interpret it to include cyber-attacks in isolation, no." He added that the "understanding of what constitutes emerging tech in government is not evenly distributed — cyber is definitely not 'emerging,' it's pretty substantially emerged." Either way, Plant believes that the change in language is significant. "I think it is a marker that there is the potential in the future for combinations of technologies and behaviors to come together that create emergent risks – which perhaps would not arise through the developments of any one technology in isolation – that are incredibly hard to predict and that there is at least the possibility that one or more of these as-yet-unknown emergent challenges might rival WMD in the threat they pose," he said. The U.K.'s nuclear program, known as Trident, was established in 1980 and it now costs the U.K. around £2 billion ($2.8 billion) a year to operate. The Integrated Defense Review confirmed that the U.K. is allowing a self-imposed cap on its nuclear weapon stockpile to rise to 260, abandoning the previous cap of 225 warheads as well as the current reduction target of 180 by the mid-2020s. "This reverses the U.K.'s course of consistent post-Cold War nuclear reductions and runs counter to previous assurances that the program to replace the U.K.'s existing nuclear deterrent would not add to the number of nuclear warheads in service," Plant wrote in a blog post. He added that the changes are presented as a reaction to a changed international security environment. "The government paints a picture of a world with growing international competition and increasing threats from Russia, China, North Korea and Iran," said Plant. "In its judgment, U.K. adversaries are increasing the variety and quantities of their nuclear capabilities, and see nuclear weapons as a means of coercion, deterrence and even warfighting." While the U.K. appears to be broadening the scenarios where it could feasibly use nuclear weapons, U.S. President Joe Biden said in his election campaign that the "sole purpose" of nuclear weapons should be to deter or retaliate against another nuclear attack. The Integrated Defense Review also outlined a new "tilt" toward the Indo-Pacific region. "By 2030, we will be deeply engaged in the Indo-Pacific as the European partner with the broadest, most integrated presence in support of mutually-beneficial trade, shared security and values," the document reads. It says the U.K. will the push into the Indo-Pacific region partly in response to "geopolitical and geoeconomic shifts" including China's global "power and assertiveness," as well as the growing importance of the region to "global prosperity and security." The report references partnerships with countries including India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has not yet decided if the 10,000 troops it has in Afghanistan will leave the country by May. Last February, the United States brokered a deal with the Taliban that would usher in a permanent cease-fire and see the departure of all foreign forces by May 2021. There are about 2,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.	WASHINGTON – NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that the alliance has not yet decided if the 10,000 troops it has in Afghanistan will leave the country by May, in accordance with a peace deal brokered between the U.S. and the Taliban. "Violence has to be reduced and the Taliban has to stop cooperating with international terrorist groups that are planning terrorist attacks in our countries," Stoltenberg told reporters at the conclusion of a two-day virtual NATO defense ministers meeting. Last February the United States brokered a deal with the Taliban that would usher in a permanent cease-fire and reduced further the U.S. military's footprint from approximately 13,000 troops to 8,600 by mid-July last year. By May 2021, all foreign forces would leave the war-weary country, according to the deal. "Our aim is to make sure that we have a lasting political agreement that can make it possible for us to leave in a way that doesn't undermine our main goal and that is to prevent Afghanistan from becoming once again a safe haven [for terrorists]," Stoltenberg said, adding "That's also the reason why we will continue to assess the situation before we make any final decision on our future." "The majority of the troops are from European allies and partner countries. We will do what is necessary to make sure that our troops are secure," Stoltenberg said when asked if the alliance was prepared for violence if the agreement with the Taliban is broken. There are about 2,500 U.S. troops in the country. Currently, the U.S. is slated to withdraw American service members from Afghanistan by May 1, 2021. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told NATO members that the Biden administration was "conducting a thorough review of the conditions of the U.S.-Taliban agreement to determine whether all parties have adhered to those conditions," according to a Pentagon readout of the meeting. "He reassured allies that the U.S. would not undertake a hasty or disorderly withdrawal from Afghanistan," the statement added. The Pentagon has previously said that the U.S. troop drawdown in Afghanistan would be contingent on the Taliban's commitments to uphold the peace deal brokered last year. The wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria have cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1.57 trillion since Sept. 11, 2001, according to a Defense Department report . The war in Afghanistan, which is now America's longest conflict, began 19 years ago and has cost U.S. taxpayers $193 billion, according to the Pentagon . Stoltenberg also said Thursday that the NATO alliance decided to expand its security training mission in Iraq . The military alliance agreed to increase its footprint from 500 personnel to around 4,000. "Our presence is conditions-based and increases in troop numbers will be incremental," he said, adding that the request for an expanded mission was made by the Iraqi government.
The Senate, voting 78-22, confirmed Antony Blinken on Tuesday to be the nation's next secretary of State. Blinken, a veteran diplomat, told lawmakers last week that he would focus on reengaging with America's allies in the wake of the Trump administration's "America First" foreign policy. Blinken said, however, that Trump "was right in taking a tougher approach to China."	WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Antony Blinken on Tuesday to be the nation's next secretary of State. The Senate voted 78 to 22. Blinken, a veteran diplomat, told lawmakers last week that he would focus on reengaging with America's allies in the wake of the Trump administration's "America First" foreign policy. Blinken said, however, that Trump "was right in taking a tougher approach to China." "I disagree, very much, with the way that he went about it in a number of areas, but the basic principle was the right one, and I think that's actually helpful to our foreign policy," Blinken said at his Senate confirmation hearing a day before Biden's inauguration. Blinken also told lawmakers that the Biden administration would revisit the landmark Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, but did not give specific details on Washington's next steps. The 2015 JCPOA accord, brokered by the Obama administration, lifted sanctions on Iran that had crippled its economy and cut its oil exports roughly in half. In exchange for sanctions relief, Iran accepted limits on its nuclear program until the terms expire in 2025. Trump called the agreement "the worst deal ever" and withdrew from the accords in 2018 . Blinken's confirmation follows those of Avril Haines , who became the first woman to lead the nation's 18 intelligence agencies as the director of national intelligence; Lloyd Austin , the nation's first Black Defense secretary, and Janet Yellen , who is the first woman to lead the Department of Treasury.
Protesters supporting President Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol, causing Congress to suspend proceedings to confirm the election of Joe Biden as president. Protesters freely roamed through the Capitol complex, including the Senate chamber, where one man stood on the president of the Senate's chair and shouted, "Trump won that election!" Vice President Mike Pence, who had been presiding over the count of Electoral College votes, was rushed out of the Senate as the complex went into lockdown as Trump supporters began breaching the complex.	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Capitol was finally secured Wednesday, hours after supporters of President Donald Trump invaded the halls of Congress to disrupt the confirmation of Joe Biden as the next president. Protesters had freely roamed through the Capitol complex, including the Senate chamber, where one man stood on the president of the Senate's chair and shouted, "Trump won that election!" Several law enforcement officials said a woman who was shot by police inside the Capitol building during the chaos had died. A video circulating on social media showed a woman falling from the window of a doorway in the Capitol, apparently after being shot. Three other people died from medical emergencies that arose during the riot. Vice President Mike Pence , who had been presiding over the count of Electoral College votes, was rushed out of the Senate as the Capitol complex went into lockdown when Trump supporters began pouring into the building. Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who are all in the line of presidential succession were taken to secure locations. Members of Congress were ordered to take shelter in the complex, where at least one improvised explosive device was found. Another pipe-bomb-like device was found at the headquarters of the Republican National Committee. As rioters, many of them clad in hats bearing Trump's "Make America Great Again" motto, rampaged, Senate staffers removed the Electoral College ballots that had been on the floor of the Senate during proceedings, according to Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. "if our capable floor staff hadn't grabbed them, they would have been burned by the mob," Merkley tweeted. Other tweets and broadcasts showed shocking images of a protester dangling from the balcony of the Senate chamber, a woman drenched in blood on a stretcher and Capitol police pointing guns on the floor of the House of Representatives. Members of Congress were photographed wearing plastic breathing devices over their heads to protect themselves from tear gas. CNN broadcast an image of protester sitting at Pelosi's desk, with a handwritten note near her computer that read, "WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN." Hours after the riot began, authorities began tossing flash-bang grenades and dispersing tear gas into a crowd of people in front of the Capitol building. "This is a coup attempt," tweeted Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah blamed Trump for the riot. "This is what the president has caused today, this insurrection," said Romney, the GOP's 2012 presidential nominee. Trump, during a rally earlier outside the White House, had encouraged thousands of supporters to march to the Capitol to protest what historically have been ceremonial proceedings. Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and top federal prosecutor, during the same rally suggested that the dispute over the election results be resolved by "trial by combat." The president later was angered to learn that Pence had said he would refuse to go along with Trump's demand that he try to block the confirmation of Biden's Electoral College victory. More than an hour after the riot began, Trump's spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said "the National Guard is on the way along with other federal protective services." "We reiterate President Trump's call against violence and to remain peaceful," McEnany said. NBC News later reported that Trump had to be convinced to deploy the National Guard. Pence, while trapped in the Capitol, was in contact with the Pentagon, and "encouraged a much more rapid deployment than what was occurring," a source familiar with the matter said. Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller said he coordinated with Pence and congressional leaders to activate the National Guard and assist officers with taking back the Capitol. He did not mention any contact with Trump. Biden, in a nationally television address, said, "At this hour, our democracy is under unprecedented assault." "It's chaos, it borders on sedition and it must end now. I call this mob to pull back and allow this work of democracy to go forward," Biden said. "Therefore I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution, and demand an end to this siege," the president-elect said. "President Trump, step up." Trump soon after released a video statement addressing the rioters at the Capitol, saying, "You have to go home," but he repeated false claims about being swindled out of an electoral victory, and called his opponents "evil." "Go home, we love, you're very special," Trump said. The president later tweeted another message. "These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace," Trump wrote. "Remember this day forever!" Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser requested the deployment of the National Guard and issued a citywide 6 p.m. ET curfew until Thursday. Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in an emailed statement: "The D.C. Guard has been mobilized to provide support to federal law enforcement in the District." He said acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller was in contact with congressional leaders and Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy was working with the D.C. government. "The law enforcement response will be led by the Department of Justice," Hoffman said. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said he was sending members of his state's National Guard and 200 state troopers to help restore order. Northam later declared a state of emergency in Virginia, and curfews in the cities of Alexandria and Arlington, which are just across the Potomac River from Washington. Acting U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said in a statement, "The violence at our Nation's Capitol Building is an intolerable attack on a fundamental institution of our democracy." "From the outset,  the Department of Justice has been working in close coordination with the Capitol Police and federal partners from the Interior Department,  the Department of Homeland Security, and the National Guard, as well as the Metropolitan Police and other local authorities," Rosen said. "Earlier this afternoon,  the Department of Justice sent hundreds of federal law enforcement officers and agents from the FBI, ATF, and the U.S. Marshals Service to assist the Capitol Police in addressing this unacceptable situation, and we intend to enforce the laws of our land." Bowser during a press conference said, "The behavior that we are witnessing is shameful, unpatriotic and above all, it is unlawful." "Anyone who has engaged in these activities, continues to engage in these activities, will be held accountable," Bowser vowed. Lawmakers had just begun the procedural process of counting the Electoral College votes and formally declaring Biden the winner when the chaos erupted. Trump, despite have told the crowd he would join them in the march to the Capitol, actually returned to the White House. Trump slammed Pence on Twitter before calling on supporters to "Stay peaceful!" Pence, in a tweet, said, "The violence and destruction taking place at the US Capitol Must Stop and it Must Stop Now. Anyone involved must respect Law Enforcement officers and immediately leave the building." "Peaceful protest is the right of every American but this attack on our Capitol will not be tolerated and those involved will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law," Pence wrote. In an interview with Fox News, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump supporter, called the protests rocking the nation's capital "unAmerican." McCarthy said he spoke to Trump and asked for his help to quell the protests. Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said in a tweet that "gas masks are being prepared." Sen. Ted Cruz, one of the Republicans leading the effort to challenge Biden's victory through a series of objections to the results of individual state elections, said, "Violence is always unacceptable. Even when passions run high." "Anyone engaged in violence — especially against law enforcement — should be fully prosecuted," Cruz tweeted. "God bless the Capitol Police and the honorable men & women of law enforcement who show great courage keeping all of us safe." Bill Barr, who resigned last month as attorney general after disputing Trump's claims of widespread ballot fraud, said, "The violence at the Capitol Building is outrageous and despicable." "Federal agencies should move immediately to disperse it," Barr said. A member of Senate leadership told NBC News that senators are determined to stay until their work of counting the electoral votes is done. The member said senators are considering continuing the count from the secure location where they are now located. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Trump ally who has become critical of the president, said on ABC News, "The president caused this protest to occur. He's the only one that can make it stop." "He spoke to this crowd. His son spoke to this crowd. I don't know if they anticipated this result. This is the result of their words," Christie said. —Amanda Macias reported from Washington.

The National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, breezed from Congress to Trump's desk with overwhelming support. Trump has previously said that he would veto the measure. At least 75 members of the Republican-led Senate voted for the defense bill, a number larger than the two-thirds majority that would be needed to defeat Trump's promised veto.	WASHINGTON — The Senate approved a colossal defense policy bill Friday despite multiple threats from President Donald Trump that he would veto the measure. At least 75 members of the Republican-led Senate voted for the sweeping $740 billion annual defense bill, a number larger than the two-thirds majority that would be needed to defeat Trump's promised veto. With the weight of the House and the Senate behind the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, the bill breezes from Congress to Trump's desk with overwhelming support. The NDAA, which typically passes with strong bipartisan support and veto-proof majorities, authorizes a topline of $740 billion in spending and outlines Pentagon policy. Earlier this month, Trump threatened to veto the must-pass defense bill if lawmakers do not include a measure eliminating legal protections for social media companies. Trump is calling for the repeal of a federal law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , which protects tech giants like Facebook and Twitter from being held legally liable for what is posted on their platforms. Last week, Trump referred to the provision as a "liability shielding gift" to "Big Tech" and called for it to be "completely terminated" otherwise he would nix this year's NDAA . The president also said the measure posed a serious threat to U.S. national security as well as election integrity but did not give any further explanatory details. Trump has also said that Twitter , his social media platform of choice, has unfairly censored him. The president's issue with Section 230 came to light this summer after Twitter added warning labels to several of his tweets that alleged mail-in voting is fraudulent. Trump has still not conceded the U.S. presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden. This year's legislation includes a 3% pay raise for U.S. troops, a plan to rename military installations bearing names of Confederate leaders as well as a slew of other provisions. The NDAA, in its current form, does not include any measure in relation to Section 230. This is not the first time the president has targeted the NDAA. Earlier this year, Trump said he would veto the measure if it included language on changing U.S. military installations named after Confederate generals.
The Trump administration acknowledged reports that a group backed by a foreign government carried out a cyberattack on the U.S. Treasury Department and a section of the U.S. Department of Commerce. "We can confirm there has been a breach in one of our bureaus. We have asked CISA and the FBI to investigate, and we cannot comment further at this time," a spokesperson for Commerce told NBC News. The latest revelation comes less than a month after President Donald Trump fired Christopher Krebs, the nation's top cybersecurity official.	WASHINGTON – The Trump administration acknowledged reports on Sunday that a group backed by a foreign government carried out a cyberattack on the U.S. Treasury Department and a section of the U.S. Department of Commerce. "The United States government is aware of these reports and we are taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation," National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot wrote in an emailed statement to CNBC. A Department of Commerce spokesperson confirmed the hack. "We can confirm there has been a breach in one of our bureaus. We have asked CISA and the FBI to investigate, and we cannot comment further at this time," a spokesperson for Commerce told NBC News. The hack was first reported by Reuters. The hackers are suspected of targeting the Treasury Department as well as the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, a U.S. agency that is tasked with crafting internet and telecommunications policy, Reuters reported. The elaborate cyber hack that was launched on NTIA involved the organization's Microsoft Office 365 platform, according to Reuters. Microsoft declined to comment. It was not immediately clear what information was compromised by the cyber breach. The Washington Post linked the hack, which occurred over the weekend, to a group working for the Russian foreign intelligence service . The FBI is currently investigating the group, known among private-sector cybersecurity firms as APT29 or Cozy Bear . The hackers are also believed to have breached the State Department, Joint Chiefs of Staff and the White House networks during the Obama administration. The Russian group is also thought to have carried out the DNC break-in during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. The latest revelation comes less than a month after President Donald Trump fired Christopher Krebs, the nation's top cybersecurity official. Krebs, who oversaw the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, was responsible for leading the effort to protect U.S. elections. In a pair of tweets last month , Trump said that Krebs gave a "highly inaccurate" statement about the security of the 2020 presidential election. Trump, who has not yet conceded to President-elect Joe Biden, made unfounded claims that the election was riddled with "massive improprieties and fraud." Twitter labeled the president's tweets with a warning citing the claim about election fraud is disputed. The courts have repeatedly dismissed suits the Trump campaign and its allies have brought over the 2020 election.
The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Turkey on Monday over its multibillion-dollar acquisition of a Russian missile system. In 2017, Turkish President Recep Erdogan brokered a deal reportedly worth $2.5 billion with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the S-400 mobile surface-to-air missile system. The S-400 system is said to pose a risk to the NATO alliance as well as the F-35, America's most expensive weapons platform.	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration slapped sanctions on Turkey on Monday over a multibillion-dollar acquisition of a Russian missile system. The long-anticipated move is expected to further stoke tensions between Washington and Ankara in the weeks ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's ascension to the White House and send a message to foreign governments considering future weapons deals with Russia. In 2017, Turkish President Recep Erdogan brokered a deal reportedly worth $2.5 billion with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the S-400 missile system. The S-400, a mobile surface-to-air missile system, is said to pose a risk to the NATO alliance as well as the F-35, America's most expensive weapons platform. Despite warnings from the United States and other NATO allies, Turkey accepted the first of four missile batteries in July 2019. A week later, the United States cut Turkey, a financial and manufacturing partner, from the F-35 program . Under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which Trump signed in August 2017, Turkey faced potential economic sanctions for accepting the Kremlin's missile system. Trump had not yet imposed sanctions on Turkey. "Turkey is a valued ally and an important regional security partner for the United States, and we seek to continue our decades-long history of productive defense-sector cooperation by removing the obstacle of Turkey's S-400 possession as soon as possible," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote in a statement announcing the sanctions. The sanctions put a ban on all U.S. export licenses and authorizations to the Republic of Turkey's Presidency of Defense Industries as well as an asset freeze and visa restrictions on the organization's president, Ismail Demir, and other top officers. "Well, it's about damn time. Strong, well-tailored sanctions are painfully overdue," said Thomas Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, when asked about the sanctions. "The details will matter a lot. This could turn out to be a softball. If the sanctions are to be meaningful, they can't be mere token," Karako added. The timing of the sanctions, more than a year after the delivery of the missile system, could have the potential to rock relations between Ankara and Washington for an incoming Biden administration. State Department officials downplayed the timing, saying that the process of implementing sanctions was "very serious" and "deliberative." "It took time to work through this complex set of issues, including, in particular, the fact that Turkey is a NATO ally, so I would not read too much into the timing of this and why today and not yesterday or three months ago," said Matthew Palmer, deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, during a call with reporters. "This is the time that was necessary for us to conclude that deliberative process." The latest revelation comes less than two months after reports surfaced that Turkey's military began testing the S-400 system. In October, both the departments of Defense and State condemned the apparent missile test off Turkey's Black Sea coast. "The United States has expressed to the Government of Turkey, at the most senior levels, that the acquisition of Russian military systems such as the S-400 is unacceptable," State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus wrote in an emailed statement at the time . "The United States has been clear on our expectation that the S-400 system should not be operationalized," she added. "We object to Turkey's purchase of the system and are deeply concerned with reports that Turkey is bringing it into operation," said chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman in an emailed statement. "It should not be activated. Doing so risks serious consequences for our security relationship." The S-400, the successor to the S-200 and S-300 missile systems, made its debut in 2007. Compared with U.S. systems, the Russian-made S-400 is believed to be capable of engaging a wider array of targets, at longer ranges and against multiple threats simultaneously. In multiple efforts to deter Turkey from buying the S-400, the State Department offered in 2013 and 2017 to sell the country Raytheon 's Patriot missile system. Ankara passed on the Patriot both times because the U.S. declined to provide a transfer of the system's sensitive missile technology. "We have repeatedly tried through our diplomatic overtures to find a way to resolve this by means that don't involve the imposition of these mandatory sanctions," explained Christopher Ford, assistant secretary for International Security and Nonproliferation, during a call with reporters. "We have also repeatedly offered them military equipment to help meet their operational needs in a way that doesn't trigger sanctions and that is, in fact, a better answer in terms of the NATO interoperability of the Turkish Defense Forces. Unfortunately, Turkey turned down every single one of these efforts over the past several years now," Ford said, adding the United States had "no choice." Despite facing potential U.S. sanctions, a dozen countries have expressed interest in buying Russia's S-400 missile system.
The Turkish lira, on a steady downward slide for the majority of this year, held roughly flat throughout the trading day on Tuesday. President Donald Trump had previously held back on the sanctions, despite numerous warnings from his administration and Congress ever since Turkish President Recep Erdogan purchased Russia's S-400 missile defense system. U.S. sanctions could have been a massive blow for the country of 82 million, but according to analysts and the response of Turkish markets, these won't be.	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Turkish markets were largely unmoved on Tuesday following the news of U.S. sanctions on Turkey for its purchase of a Russian missile system against NATO opposition. The Turkish lira , on a steady downward slide for the majority of this year, held roughly flat at around 7.84 to the dollar throughout the trading day on Tuesday. President Donald Trump had previously held back on the sanctions, designed under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), despite numerous warnings from his administration and Congress ever since Turkish President Recep Erdogan brokered a deal in 2017 with Russian President Vladimir Putin for its S-400 missile system, reportedly worth $2.5 billion. Turkey began receiving the missile parts in 2019 — resulting in its exclusion from America's F-35 program with NATO allies — and reportedly tested the system last October. "Markets probably understand the sanctions for what they are: symbolic with minor if any impact on financial or real sectors," Erik Meyersson, senior economist at Handelsbanken Macro Research, told CNBC. That's because out of all the penalties available under CAATSA, the ones applied on Monday were particularly light. The sanctions ban all U.S. export licenses and authorizations to Turkey's Presidency of Defense Industries and impose asset freezes and visa restrictions on the organization's president and other senior officers. "It's obviously a nuisance for the institution and individuals targeted. But in broader terms, I see rather limited negative spillovers onto the financial and real sectors," Meyersson said. Still, Turkish government officials roundly condemned the move. "No country's sanctions will sway Turkey's determined stance. We condemn this decision and call on the US to step back from this mistake as soon as possible," Vice President Fuat Oktay said via Twitter. The announcement received bipartisan praise among U.S. lawmakers, with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) saying: "It's about time. I'm glad to see Congress do what the Administration would not – and show President Erdogan that we will not back down when it comes to protecting our security and that of our faithful NATO allies." The statement alluded to Trump's seeming unwillingness to sanction Turkey in the past, owing, many believe, to a warm relationship between the two leaders. For the administration's part, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote in a statement Monday: "Turkey is a valued ally and an important regional security partner for the United States, and we seek to continue our decades-long history of productive defense-sector cooperation by removing the obstacle of Turkey's S-400 possession as soon as possible." Turkey's economy is deep in recession after several years of a falling currency, double-digit inflation, and rising employment even before the pandemic hit. The U.S. sanctions could have been a massive blow for the country of 82 million, but according to analysts and the response of Turkish markets, they won't be. "Compared to the sanctions options which could have been chosen — say Iran sanctions are a 10, and Russia 3 out of 10, these were something less than 0.5," Tim Ash, senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, wrote in an email note. "Message seems to be that these were specifically designed by the Trump administration to limit the hit to the Turkish economy and markets." Handelsbanken's Meyersson agreed. "The sanctions happened now because Congress basically forced Trump's hands," he said. The timing is important: just weeks ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration as president. Biden has called Erdogan an "autocrat" and suggested a harder line on the country for its controversial foreign policy moves. But the softness of these sanctions could set the stage for reconciliation as well, Ash said. "The good news for the market is that they are out of the way, and it clears some of the page for Biden to re-write the script of U.S.-Turkey relations when he takes office," he wrote. As a NATO ally with the second-largest military in the transatlantic alliance and highly strategic air bases that host thousands of U.S. troops and weapons, Turkey is a very important partner — and could be a very difficult adversary. It should be a priority, Ash said, for the U.S. to pull Erdogan back into the Western fold and away from Russian and Chinese orbits. How easy that will be given Erdogan's growing closeness with U.S. adversaries and increasingly aggressive foreign policy, however, in addition to Biden's own agenda, is yet to be seen. —CNBC's Amanda Macias contributed to this report.
The meltdown began on Dec. 13 when Reuters reported that hackers potentially linked to Russia had gained access to email systems at the U.S. Commerce and Treasury departments, and that the attackers got in by way of SolarWinds software updates. The Homeland Security agency on Sunday instructed federal agencies that were affected to disconnect or power down certain versions of SolarWinds software in their networks, and Microsoft warned customers its antivirus tool would begin blocking malicious SolarWinds software. Last week SolarWinds announced a new CEO, and two private-equity firms sold shares ahead of the drop.	Shares of IT management software maker SolarWinds are down 23% this week after the company disclosed a cyberattack against its software that affected U.S. government customers. The hack could have a considerable impact on prominent organizations, and potentially on the company's future. SolarWinds, based in Austin, Texas, offers a variety of tools organizations can use to manage their software. Competitors include BMC, CA, Cisco and IBM . The company has over 300,000 customers, and the U.S. government is a notable part of its customer base. "We depend on the U.S. federal government in certain calendar quarters for a meaningful portion of our on-premise license sales," SolarWinds said in its most recent annual report . "The delay or loss of these sales may harm our operating results." The meltdown began on Dec. 13 when Reuters reported that hackers potentially linked to Russia had gained access to email systems at the U.S. Commerce and Treasury departments, and that the attackers got in by way of SolarWinds software updates. The New York Times later said the Defense Department, State Department and Department of Homeland Security were affected. The Homeland Security agency on Sunday instructed federal agencies that were affected to disconnect or power down certain versions of SolarWinds software in their networks. Microsoft warned customers its antivirus tool would begin blocking malicious SolarWinds software. A page that has been removed from SolarWinds' website boasted that "all five branches of the U.S. military" were customers, along with many major federal agencies. In a Dec. 14 regulatory filing , SolarWinds said that it estimated less than 10% of its customers had software that contained the vulnerability, and that it had sent an alert to customers that might have been affected. The company said it believed the vulnerability was added into its software between March and June. Reuters reported, citing unnamed people, that the SolarWinds attack is related to a breach of software tools maintained by security company FireEye , an incident FireEye disclosed on Dec. 8. Shares were down 0.2%, after an 8% fall on Tuesday and a nearly 17% fall on Monday, which was the stock's worst trading day since the company went public in 2018. Still, one analyst isn't so sure the attack, which Microsoft dubbed Solorigate, will have a major impact on the company. "We believe the SolarWinds brand will remain intact as customers continue to seek the company's attractive value proposition," JMP Securities analyst Erik Suppiger, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on SolarWinds stock, wrote in a note distributed to clients on Tuesday. Filings show that two private-equity firms, Silver Lake and Thoma Bravo , sold some of their SolarWinds stock on Dec. 7 at $21.97 per share, before this week's fall. The firms acquired SolarWinds for $4.5 billion in 2016 and owned more than 80% of the company after its initial public offering. Today six of SolarWinds' 11 board members have ties to Silver Lake or Thoma Bravo. "Thoma Bravo and Silver Lake were not aware of this potential cyberattack at SolarWinds prior to entering into a private placement to a single institutional investor on 12/7," a spokesperson representing the firms told CNBC in an email. On Dec. 9 SolarWinds said that its CEO for the past decade, Kevin Thompson, had resigned two days earlier, and announced that Sudhakar Ramakrishna, CEO of privately held Pulse Secure, would replace Thompson.

Many workers have trouble accumulating enough savings toward retirement. One reason is many take early withdrawals from retirement plans to pay for immediate expenses. Now, some are calling for employers to address the problem by creating plans to encourage emergency savings.	Putting away enough savings for retirement has always been a struggle for many Americans. One reason workers tend to fall short: they often dip into the money they have set aside for their golden years. Now, some experts and lawmakers are discussing one idea that could help workers avoid that – by enabling employers to offer emergency savings plans. The programs would work similarly to retirement savings programs many employers already offer, allowing employees to save for unforeseen events alongside the long-term funds dedicated to their later years. The idea surfaced at a recent Senate hearing on retirement security. The discussion painted a grim picture of where some Americans are with regard to retirement preparation.

You don't need to be ultra-wealthy to consider a prenup "We were facing a retirement crisis before Covid-19," Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said. "But, as with so many other things, this pandemic has just poured gasoline on the fire." "If we are going to rebuild our country stronger and fairer, we have to address the reality that for far too long, the ways we help families plan for the future have been stuck in the past," she said. There are complex reasons why Americans have had so much trouble putting money away for the future. Many workers do not have access to retirement plans through their employers. Even those who do may find it tough to set aside money they could put to other more immediate needs. Studies also show Americans routinely struggle to come up with enough money to handle an unexpected expense. In fact, 40% of Americans would have difficulties covering a $400 expense, a 2018 Federal Reserve report found. A more recent survey from Bankrate.com released in January reported that fewer than 4 in 10 people could pay for a $1,000 expense out of savings. "Unfortunately, an alarming share of Americans have very little emergency savings or even none whatsoever," Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said during his Senate testimony. One way to solve that would be extending the automatic enrollment features now offered for workplace retirement plans to emergency savings, Akabas said. That would enable employers to default their employees into a plan that automatically puts a portion of their paychecks aside for routine savings. Efforts to address this issue are already underway, including a $50 million emergency savings initiative launched by BlackRock in 2019. But there are challenges to getting such plans off the ground, such as low participation and regulatory barriers, Akabas said. "Unfortunately, the law is unclear for employers that want to adopt automatic enrollment for these accounts," Akabas said. "Providing regulatory clarity along with reasonable consumer protections will open the door to this promising tool and with it, better savings outcomes." A bill to help employers experiment with offering these kinds of accounts is expected to be reintroduced this year, Akabas said. That bipartisan proposal was backed by Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J.; Todd Young, R-Ind.; and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., in the last Congress. Fidelity Investments is among the firms encouraging the adoption of such programs to help workers avoid early withdrawals from their retirement savings, Dave Gray, head of workplace retirement products at the firm, said during the Senate hearing. Last year, 1.6 million Fidelity customers took distributions from their retirement accounts under the CARES Act after the Covid-19 pandemic hit. "The substantial number of withdrawals demonstrates the need for emergency savings," Gray said. Legislation could help spur the creation of emergency savings programs that allow participants to earn a match to their retirement plan by contributing to an emergency savings account, he said. Until then, experts recommend individuals and families put away savings so that they can handle unforeseen expenses when they crop up. "It generally doesn't happen without having a forced savings into a separate account," said certified financial planner Ted Jenkin, CEO of Atlanta-based Oxygen Financial. Workers should generally strive to have at least three to six months of cash in a bank account separate from the one for checking, either online or with a community bank, Jenkin said.
In two online events Thursday, five members of Facebook's oversight board defended their decision to punt a ruling on how long former President Donald Trump's suspension from the platform should last. Their defense essentially boiled down to: It's not our job to write Facebook's rules. Oversight board member and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt told Axios, "It was a bit lazy of Facebook to send over to us a penalty suggestion that didn't exist in their own rulebook, so to speak."	In two online events on Thursday, five members of Facebook 's oversight board defended their decision to punt a ruling on how long former President Donald Trump's suspension from the platform should last . Their defense essentially boiled down to: It's not our job to write Facebook's rules . In Wednesday's announcement of the oversight board ruling, it said Facebook was right to suspend Trump's accounts in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol due to the threat of imminent harm and Trump's praise of the violent rioters in violation of Facebook's policies. But, it said, the indefinite time frame was inappropriate, and the board refused to take on what it saw as Facebook's obligation to create its own policies. "In applying a vague, standardless penalty and then referring this case to the Board to resolve, Facebook seeks to avoid its responsibilities," wrote the board, an independent committee of 20 outside experts. "The Board declines Facebook's request and insists that Facebook apply and justify a defined penalty." The board gave Facebook six months to review the penalty. In an interview with Axios on Thursday, oversight board member and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said, "It was a bit lazy of Facebook to send over to us a penalty suggestion that didn't exist in their own rulebook, so to speak." "We are not here to lift responsibility off of Facebook," she added. Two other board members said it's simply outside the scope of the board's mandate to make up and enforce Facebook's policies. "We thought above all, this was not a decision about Donald Trump, but rather a decision about Facebook," John Samples, board member and a Cato Institute vice president, told Axios. Facebook's decision, he added, included enforcing a rule "that didn't exist at the time" in imposing the indefinite ban. "It's their job to enforce the rules," he said. "The board's job is to make sure Facebook is doing its job," board member and Columbia University law professor Jamal Greene said at a separate event hosted by the Aspen Institute on Thursday. "The board's job is not to make decisions about users in the first instance." At the same event, Julie Owono, board member and executive director of digital rights organization Internet Sans Frontières, rejected the premise that the board had shirked a decision in this case. She said the board laid out clear guidelines for how Facebook can apply consistent standards in a transparent way across all users on its platform. "We are saying that all users matter on the platform," she said. "What we're doing in that decision is to remind Facebook that it has responsibility to protect public safety and it should do so in a way that's respectful of international human rights." Ronaldo Lemos, board member and law professor at Rio de Janeiro State University, said that while he's heard many critiques of the limited nature of the board's power, it has already had a significant impact on the company. While the board's policy recommendations are not binding, Facebook has agreed to be held to its decisions about whether to reinstate or take down content. Facebook funded a trust to sustain the board, but it cannot revoke the money or remove members. Still, Facebook is ultimately entitled to make its own business decisions. While the oversight board's decision was likely not what Facebook expected, Thorning-Schmidt said she doesn't think the company will regret forming the body. "In the long run, they will benefit from the clarity and the principled decision-making that we are pushing them into," she said. "I do think this will be the last day where they will make an arbitrary sanction." Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube. WATCH: The big, messy business of content moderation on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube
Congress has allocated more than $45 billion in rental assistance. But states are struggling to get the money to renters, many of whom are still facing the threat of eviction.	Since Matthew Turner was laid off in October, he estimates he's applied to close to 600 jobs, with no luck. Nearly as difficult has been his hunt for rental assistance. Turner's contacted many local organizations in North Carolina where he lives, but has been denied or left on waitlists by all of them. He and his husband, Gerard, have depleted their savings and don't know how they're going to come up with May's rent for their Raleigh apartment. "It's incredibly stressful," Turner, 48, said. "You don't know what else to do." More from Personal Finance: Lawmakers step up to improve access to college aid College can cost as much as $70,000 a year Under Biden, free college could become a reality Congress has allocated a total of more than $45 billion in rental assistance after the coronavirus pandemic cost millions of Americans their jobs and left as many as 1 in 5 renters unable to keep up with their housing payments, including close to a third of African American renters. However, the rollout of the relief funds isn't coming fast enough for many, and evictions continue despite a national ban on the proceedings. So far, states and their local programs are in the process of distributing $16 billion of the $25 billion in rental assistance passed in December, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. In May, the Department of the Treasury will begin sending to states and localities the additional $21 billion in rental assistance allocated in March's stimulus package. As of early April, three months after the $25 billion in relief was passed, some 20 states have yet to open a program to give out the aid. That has left tenants across the country stuck in line for the assistance. "Wait times for rent relief in Massachusetts are still weeks to months," said Helen Matthews , communications manager at City Life/Vida Urbana, a nonprofit in Boston. The delays are due to the fact that states are figuring out how to distribute an unprecedented amount of money, experts say. In addition, housing advocates say that some states are unnecessarily slowing things by imposing arduous documentation requirements for tenants to qualify. Another issue is that state programs have the option of giving the money directly to a renter if their landlord refuses to participate, but most aren't doing so, said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition . (Some landlords don't want to agree to certain terms of accepting the assistance, which can include not raising rent or evicting their tenant for a period of time.) Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has banned most evictions through the end of June , many landlords are pushing out tenants anyway. Since the CDC ban went into effect in September, The Eviction Lab at Princeton University has identified more than 217,000 evictions in just the five states and 19 cities that it tracks. Some federal judges have questioned the CDC's authority to ban evictions , and an advisory body to the Texas courts this month issued guidance saying judges didn't need to enforce the moratorium . Unable to rely on the eviction ban for protection, struggling renters in Texas have also not had much luck getting rental assistance. A report published this month on Texas' rent relief program found that out of more than 176,000 people who've begun applying for financial assistance there, only 250 applications have been approved with payments sent out. "If it takes you 45 days to get money, and 44 days to get evicted, what was the point of the money?" said Mark A. Melton , a lawyer who has been representing tenants pro bono during the pandemic. "It's like drowning in the ocean and being 12 inches away from a lifeline, but no one is helping to push it your way."
Save America, former President Donald Trump's leadership PAC, is going into the second quarter of 2021 with that gargantuan sum of cash, according to a person who has direct knowledge of the matter. This person did not say how much the PAC raised in the first quarter and pointed to the fact that it files disclosures semiannually, which means the public won't see details on Trump's fundraising success until the summer. Trump has significant resources to deploy as he looks to make an impact on the 2022 midterm elections, when Republicans will try to make inroads in both the House and Senate. Democrats currently have control of both chambers of Congress.	Former President Donald Trump 's political action committee has amassed a war chest of more than $85 million as he builds an operation meant to take on his enemies and possibly fuel another run for president in 2024. Save America, Trump's leadership PAC, heads into the second quarter with that gargantuan sum of cash on hand, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be named as the fundraising data has not been made public. The PAC raised more than $30 million from late November through December, and finished last year with $31 million on hand, Federal Election Commission filings show. This person did not say how much the PAC raised in the first quarter, noting that it files disclosures semiannually, which means the public likely won't see details on Trump's fundraising success until the summer. The total also does not include the cash on hand for other Trump-affiliated PACs, including the Trump Make America Great Again Committee. Trump has significant resources to deploy as he looks to influence the 2022 midterm elections, when Republicans will try to make inroads in both the House and Senate. Democrats currently control both chambers of Congress. Trump, however, has targeted Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and promised to back GOP "primary rivals who espouse Making America Great Again and our policy of America First." The former president turned on McConnell after the senator said Trump bore responsibility for the mob of his supporters that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Trump is expected to speak at the Republican National Committee's spring retreat this weekend. He has not ruled out running for president again. Meanwhile, Trump has become involved in the battle brewing between Republican lawmakers and corporations who have come out against a new law in Georgia that critics say restricts voting. The former president falsely claimed widespread fraud cost him the 2020 presidential election in the state, and urged Georgia officials to overturn President Joe Biden 's win there. "It is finally time for Republicans and Conservatives to fight back—we have more people than they do—by far! Boycott Major League Baseball, Coca-Cola, Delta Airlines, JPMorgan Chase, ViacomCBS, Citigroup, Cisco, UPS, and Merck," Trump said in a statement Saturday. Major League Baseball announced a day earlier that it would pull its All-Star Game out of Atlanta after Georgia's latest voting bill was signed into law by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.  MLB is reportedly moving the game to Colorado. Trump's $85 million haul also arrives as he is reportedly looking to create his own social media network after being banned by both Twitter and Facebook .

Elizabeth Warren is taking aim at Archegos Capital Management and the lightly regulated hedge-fund industry after their stock trades sent the market into a frenzy late last week. "Archegos' meltdown had all the makings of a dangerous situation — largely unregulated hedge fund, opaque derivatives, trading in private dark pools, high leverage, and a trader who wriggled out of the SEC's enforcement," Warren told CNBC in a statement Tuesday. "Regulators need to rely on more than luck to fend off risks to the financial system: we need transparency and strong oversight to ensure that the next hedge fund blowup doesn't take the economy down with it," she added.

Joe Biden will travel to Pittsburgh on Wednesday to detail a plan to overhaul U.S. infrastructure and manufacturing — the first of two sweeping economic recovery proposals. The administration's economic team is still ironing out the details of the second package, which will involve huge investments in U.S. health care and child care. Biden's speech sets the stage for his second major legislative battle in less than three months as president, following the passage of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill.	President Joe Biden on Wednesday will detail a plan to overhaul U.S. infrastructure and manufacturing, setting the stage for his second major legislative battle in less than three months as president. Biden will travel to Pittsburgh to unveil the first of two sweeping economic recovery proposals. Together, they will likely carry a multitrillion-dollar price tag that dwarfs the $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan he signed into law earlier this month . The administration's economic team is still ironing out the details of the second plan, which will involve huge investments in U.S. health care and child care. The White House says it will roll out that proposal sometime in April. The speech in the Steel City — Biden's first trip to western Pennsylvania since taking office — comes as the president prepares to shift his gaze beyond the immediate threat of a still-raging pandemic and focus on longer-term issues. The first leg of the double-barreled recovery package will focus on repairing America's infrastructure — its roads, bridges, railways, water systems and other structures. Biden is also set to call for investments in domestic manufacturing, research and development and the caregiving workforce . Experts say an infrastructure update is long past due. The American Society of Civil Engineers' most recent "report card" gave the nation's infrastructure an overall C-minus grade . The group estimates that the U.S. faces an infrastructure "investment gap" of nearly $2.6 trillion over 10 years. Continued underinvestment will cost more than 3 million jobs and $10 trillion in GDP by 2039, it said. Biden's handling of the pandemic has so far garnered high approval ratings and buoyed his popularity, polls show . But he could soon have to tap into built-up political capital, as the White House moves to hike taxes to pay for the new infrastructure plan. Lawmakers from both parties have long pushed to revitalize America's aging infrastructure. Republican former President Donald Trump's administration, for instance, repeatedly postured about plans to address infrastructure. Those plans never came to fruition, and " infrastructure week " became a running joke in Washington. But Biden has already faced steadfast opposition from congressional Republicans, none of whom voted for his broadly popular Covid rescue plan . The staggering costs of Biden's forthcoming economic recovery package — possibly more than $3 trillion, The New York Times reported — and the threat of higher taxes are bound to spark the GOP's ire. Some moderate Democrats are also raising concerns, Axios reported. Wall Street is watching, as well . Strategists expect Biden will push to reverse some of the Trump-era tax cuts and raise others on individuals and businesses. Some warn the stock market could take a hit from tax hikes. The administration has reached out to industry leaders ahead of the legislative rollout. White House climate advisor Gina McCarthy last week discussed infrastructure plans with oil and gas executives, the Times reported. Biden has promised not to raise taxes on those making under $400,000 a year. The White House recently clarified that income threshold would apply to individuals and families . The president "believes that we have an opportunity to rebalance" parts of the tax code that are "out of date," White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Monday. She said that "some could pay more in our country that are not currently." Psaki later added: "I can assure you that when the president lays out his infrastructure plan, he will also lay out a plan to pay for it." The administration has revealed few specifics, but some administration officials have raised eyebrows with their comments. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Friday suggested to CNBC that several possible levies, including a vehicle mileage tax , could be on the table to finance the infrastructure project. He later said a gas or mileage tax would not be part of the plan. In the wake of the polarized fight in Congress over the latest Covid relief bill, administration officials have signaled they don't want to shut Republicans out of future talks. "Throughout this process, we look forward to working with a broad coalition of members of Congress to gather their input and ideas, and determine the path forward," Psaki said Monday. She also declined to take a stance on whether Biden supports the reported efforts by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to enable the evenly split Senate to pass more legislation through budget reconciliation. The process would allow Democrats to pass a bill without Republican votes. "The White House and the President will leave the mechanics of bill-passing to Leader Schumer and other leaders in Congress," Psaki said. Once the package is unveiled, the administration's focus is "on having that engagement and discussion with members of Congress." "If they share a goal of building our infrastructure for the future but don't like the way he's going to propose to pay for it, we're happy to look at their proposals," she added. "If they don't want to pay for it, I guess they can propose that too. Maybe they don't support infrastructure spending."
President Biden unveiled a more than $2 trillion infrastructure and economic recovery package on Wednesday. The plan aims to revitalize U.S. transportation infrastructure, water systems, broadband and manufacturing, among other goals. An increase in the corporate tax rate to 28% and measures designed to prevent offshoring of profits will fund the spending, according to the White House.	President Joe Biden unveiled a more than $2 trillion infrastructure package on Wednesday as his administration shifts its focus to bolstering the post-pandemic economy. The plan Biden outlined Wednesday includes roughly $2 trillion in spending over eight years and would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% to fund it. Speaking at a union hall in Pittsburgh, the president called it a vision to create "the strongest, most resilient, innovative economy in the world" — and millions of "good-paying jobs" along the way. The White House said the tax hike, combined with measures designed to stop offshoring of profits, would fund the infrastructure plan within 15 years. The proposal would: The announcement kicks off Biden's second major initiative after passage of a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan earlier this month. In the new move, the administration aims to approve a first proposal designed to create jobs, revamp U.S. infrastructure and fight climate change before it turns toward a second plan to improve education and expand paid leave and health-care coverage. Biden said he will unveil the second part of his recovery package "in a few weeks." "These are investments we have to make," Biden said of revamping U.S. infrastructure. "We can afford to make them. To put it another way — we can't afford not to." While Democrats narrowly control both chambers of Congress, the party faces challenges in passing the infrastructure plan. The GOP broadly supports efforts to rebuild roads, bridges and airports and expand broadband access, but Republicans oppose tax hikes as part of the process. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Wednesday he is "not likely" to support the proposal because of the tax increases. Biden called McConnell on Tuesday to brief him on the plan. McConnell's Democratic counterpart, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, touted the bill as a means to create jobs while promoting clean energy and transportation. In a statement Wednesday, he said, "I look forward to working with President Biden to pass a big, bold plan that will drive America forward for decades to come." The president responded to criticism of proposed tax hikes, saying he would not increase the burden on anyone making less than $400,000 per year. He said he did not aim to punish the wealthy. "This is not to target those who've made it. Not to seek retribution," he said. "This is about opening opportunities for everybody else." Among the administration's goals, it aims to revamp 20,000 miles of roads and highways and repair 10,000 bridges. The proposal calls to build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers by 2030 and replace 50,000 diesel public transit vehicles. The administration hopes to build or rehabilitate 500,000 homes for low- and middle-income Americans and replace all lead pipes in drinking-water systems. The plan also aims to deliver universal, affordable broadband service. The White House wants to ensure public transportation revitalization reaches communities of color harmed by past projects, such as highways built through neighborhoods. The administration also aims to focus efforts to make homes, schools, transportation and utility grids more resilient in marginalized communities more likely to bear the brunt of severe weather events. Biden plans to fund the spending by raising the corporate tax rate to 28%. Republicans slashed the levy to 21% from 35% as part of their 2017 tax law. The administration also wants to boost the global minimum tax for multinational corporations and ensure they pay at least 21% in taxes in any country. The White House aims to discourage firms from listing tax havens as their address and writing off expenses related to offshoring, among other reforms. Biden hopes the package will create manufacturing jobs and rescue failing American infrastructure as the country tries to emerge from the shadow of Covid-19. He and congressional Democrats also plan to combat climate change and start a transition to cleaner energy sources. The president announced his plans in Pittsburgh, a city where organized labor has a strong presence and the economy has undergone a shift from traditional manufacturing and mining to health care and technology. Biden, who has pledged to create union jobs as part of the infrastructure plan, launched his presidential campaign at a Pittsburgh union hall in 2019. Biden has said he hopes to win Republican support for an infrastructure bill. If Democrats cannot get 10 GOP senators on board, they will have to try to pass the bill through budget reconciliation, which would not require any Republicans to back the plan in a chamber split 50-50 by party. Biden said he would hear out GOP ideas on infrastructure. "We'll have a good-faith negotiation with any Republican who wants to help get this done," Biden said Wednesday. "But we have to get it done." Democrats will also have to consider whether to package the physical infrastructure plans with other recovery policies including universal pre-K and expanded paid leave. Republicans likely would not back more spending to boost the social safety net, especially if Democrats move to hike taxes on the wealthy to fund programs. Schumer on Wednesday also previewed a potential sticking point within his party. He said he wanted the infrastructure plan to include a repeal of the cap on state and local tax deductions — a change which would disproportionately help higher-income people in high-tax states including New Jersey, Connecticut and Schumer's home state, New York. Democrats are looking to pass the package this summer. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told the Democratic caucus in the chamber that she would like to have it passed by July 4, according to a source familiar with the matter. The source, who declined to be named because the remark was made in private, added that it was not intended as a deadline. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday night, an administration official did not say whether Biden would seek to pass the plan with bipartisan support. "We will begin and will already have begun to do extensive outreach to our counterparts in Congress," the official said. Asked Monday about how the bill could pass, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would "leave the mechanics of bill passing to Leader Schumer and other leaders in Congress." As of now, Democrats will have two more shots at budget reconciliation before the 2022 midterms. Schumer hopes to persuade the chamber's parliamentarian to allow Democrats to use the process at least once more beyond those two opportunities, according to NBC News. The party passed its $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package without a Republican vote. — CNBC's Kevin Breuninger and Ylan Mui contributed to this report Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
President Biden wants to dramatically expand internet access to Americans with a $100 billion investment as part of his new infrastructure plan. The proposal includes investments in the electric vehicle market, which the plan bills as a job creator, and in research and development programs. The plan seeks to close racial and gender disparities in science, technology, engineering and math by proposing investments directed toward historically Black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions.	President Joe Biden wants to dramatically expand internet access to Americans with a $100 billion investment as part of his new $2 trillion infrastructure plan unveiled on Wednesday. The proposal also includes investments in the electric vehicle market, which the Biden plan bills as a job creator, and in research and development programs. The plan seeks to close racial and gender disparities in science, technology, engineering and math by proposing investments directed toward historically Black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions. Here are some of the key parts of the proposal aimed at beefing up U.S. tech infrastructure and prowess: Biden seeks to get all Americans connected to the internet through a $100 billion investment in expanding broadband access. In a 2021 report , the Federal Communications Commission estimated that as of the end of 2019, about 14.5 million Americans were living in areas without access to fixed broadband that reaches its benchmark for speed. But other sources, like Microsoft and Broadband Now, have estimated much higher numbers of Americans who lack access to quality broadband . Biden's investment proposal would target underserved areas and prioritize support for broadband networks affiliated with local governments, nonprofits and cooperatives. It would also set aside funds for tribal lands, which are among areas lacking the most access to high-speed internet. The plan emphasizes the need for robust competition in the broadband market to benefit consumers. It would remove obstacles that prevent municipally owned or affiliated providers and rural co-ops from competing evenly with private companies and require price transparency from internet providers. According to the proposal, Biden acknowledges that internet subsidies may be needed for the short term, but believes a long-term solution must focus on lowering internet prices for consumers overall. The plan has already attracted criticism from a think tank that has received funding from a telecom industry group . Doug Brake, director of broadband and spectrum policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said the plan "goes overboard and threatens to undermine the system of private competition that successfully serves most of the United States." "No doubt, the United States sorely needs subsidies for rural broadband, but this isn't an area to turn all the dials up to 11," Brake said in a statement. "If not properly targetted, such a large investment risks undermining incentives for private capital to invest even where it can do so profitably, which ultimately erodes the engine of innovation for next-generation connectivity." Biden is calling on Congress to make a $180 billion investment in research and development and new technologies to set the U.S. up for success, including in its innovation race with China. Within that investment, Biden wants to see $50 billion allocated to the National Science Foundation to create a technology directorate to collaborate and build on existing government programs, with focuses in areas like semiconductors, advanced computing and biotechnology. He wants $30 billion to go toward R&D spurring innovation and job creation, with a focus on rural areas and $40 billion toward upgrading research infrastructure. The plan specifically calls for investments in historically Black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions, like by allocating half of the research infrastructure upgrade dollars to those institutions. The administration cites research finding that U.S. innovation would be much higher if people impacted by structural barriers, like women, people of color and children of low-income families, invented at rates of groups who are not. The proposal would give $10 billion in R&D investment in HBCUs and MSIs as well as $15 billion for creating up to 200 centers of excellence at such institutions to serve as research incubators providing opportunities for underserved populations. Biden's R&D investment plan also includes a focus on climate issues, with a proposal for a new national lab focused on climate and affiliated with an HBCU. Biden wants $35 billion to go toward finding solutions for "technology breakthroughs" seeking to address the climate crisis and position the U.S. as a leader in clean energy tech and jobs. The Biden plan would allocate $174 billion to invest in making the U.S. the leader in the electric vehicle market, to pull ahead of China. The money would allow automakers to create domestic supply chains, rework their factories and support workers in the field. It would also incentivize consumers to purchase American-made EVs by providing them with point-of-sale rebates and tax incentives. The plan sets a goal of building a national network of half a million EV chargers by 2030. The administration also seeks to replace 50,000 diesel transit vehicles, electrify at least 20% of yellow school buses and work on electrifying federal vehicles, like those within the United States Postal Service.

President Joe Biden's infrastructure plan includes $174 billion in spending to boost the electric vehicle market and shift away from gas-powered cars. The plan also proposes $100 billion in funding to update the country's electric grid and make it more resilient to climate disasters, such as the recent winter storm that disrupted Texas' power grid. If signed into law, the plan would rank as one of the largest federal efforts ever to curb the country's planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.	President Joe Biden on Wednesday introduced a massive infrastructure proposal to reshape the U.S. economy and build out clean energy infrastructure as part of a broader effort to curb climate change. If signed into law, the proposal would rank as one of the largest federal efforts ever to curb the country's greenhouse gas emissions and advance the president's commitment to put the country on a path to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The measure, called the American Jobs Plan, includes $174 billion in spending to boost the electric vehicle market and shift away from gas-powered cars. It proposes replacing all the country's lead pipes and updating water systems to ensure drinking water is safe. The administration's plan, which also includes measures unrelated to climate and infrastructure, is ambitious and could be difficult to impose even if it does pass through both chambers of Congress. "If we act now, in 50 years people are going to look back and say: 'This was the moment that America won the future,'" Biden said at a union hall in Pittsburgh. The initiatives involve funding to install half a million charging stations across the country by 2030, incentives for Americans to buy EVs and money to retool factories and boost domestic supply of materials. Electric cars only make up about 2% of new auto sales in the U.S. The proposal also includes $100 billion in funding to update the country's electric grid and make it more resilient to worsening climate disasters, such as the recent winter storm that caused widespread blackouts in Texas. As global temperatures rise, the U.S. will update aging infrastructure like roads and bridges to be more resilient to weather events like droughts, floods and wildfires. The plan will retrofit millions of homes to increase energy efficiency, with efforts focused on the low-income and minority communities most vulnerable to climate change. Biden also proposes the creation of a "Energy Efficiency and Clean Electricity Standard," a mandate that would require a portion of U.S. electricity come from zero-carbon sources like wind and solar power. The mandate would require congressional approval. The president is calling on Congress to invest $35 billion in research and development for projects on technologies to mitigate climate change and create jobs, such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, offshore wind, and electric vehicles. In an effort to help fossil fuel workers transition to new jobs, the plan also includes $16 billion to employ those workers to cap oil and gas wells and reclaim old coal mines to curb methane leaks. Another $10 billion would establish a "Civilian Climate Corps" to employ people to restore land. Some environmental advocates and liberal Democrats criticized the proposal as insufficient to tackle climate change, pointing to Biden's vows to spend $2 trillion over four years to transition the economy to net-zero emissions. "This is not nearly enough," Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., wrote in a tweet about the infrastructure plan. Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said Biden's plan is "industry-friendly" and falls short on the president's promise to cut emissions and decarbonize the electricity sector. Other environmental groups praised Biden's plan as boosting clean energy and confronting the threats of worsening climate disasters. "President Biden is demonstrating today that he is committed to building a better society for all people," Mitchell Bernard, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. "Congress must now work expeditiously to turn this vision into reality by passing legislation to invest in clean energy, safe drinking water, public transit, affordable housing — and much, much more," Bernard said. The administration would fund part of the spending by eliminating tax credits and subsidies for fossil fuel producers. Biden plans to fund a bulk of the plan by raising the corporate tax rate to 28%, after the Trump administration cut the levy to 21% from 35% as part of a tax law in 2017.
The CDC announced this week that it was extending the national ban on evictions for another three months. Who qualifies? What if your landlord ignores it? Here's what you need to know.	Most renters struggling during the coronavirus pandemic won't have to worry about being pushed out of their homes for at least another three months. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has extended the national eviction ban that's been in place since September through the end of June. Around 20% of adult renters said they didn't pay last month's rent, according to a survey published in March by the Census Bureau. Closer to 33% of Black renters reported the same. More from Personal Finance: Four months behind on rent, he got help from his landlord More than 2,000 organizations urge Biden to extend eviction ban What to know about applying for some of the $45 billion in rental aid Here's what you need to know about the protection. Under the moratorium, most tenants struggling to pay their rent amid the pandemic cannot be evicted through June 30. Eligibility can be met in a few ways. If you received a stimulus check in 2020 or 2021, didn't have to report any income to the IRS in 2020 or earned less than $99,000 as an individual or $198,000 as a joint filer, you're protected by the ban. In addition, you'll need to attest on a declaration form that you're unable to make your full housing payment because of financial setbacks, including a substantial drop in income or high out-of-pocket medical expenses. If you meet the above requirements, you have to sign this declaration and give it to your landlord. "If a tenant cannot pay the rent, they should provide the declaration to their property owner as soon as possible," said Emily Benfer, an eviction expert and a visiting professor of law at Wake Forest University. The CDC's eviction ban has been criticized for lacking adequate enforcement, and hundreds of thousands of people have been pushed out of their homes despite the policy . That may soon change. With this extension of the moratorium, regulators , including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, have vowed to crack down on violations by property owners. And on the new declaration form, landlords are threatened with fines and imprisonment if they don't comply. If your landlord ignores the ban after you've given them the declaration, file a complaint with the CFPB. You should also promptly seek legal help. Sometimes the paperwork you receive with the hearing date of your eviction will have the contact information for legal services in your area. If not, you should be able to find your agency online, said Alexis Erkert , a lawyer at Southeast Louisiana Legal Services. "The court may also be able to give people contact information," Erkert said. You can find low-cost or free legal help regarding an eviction in your state at Lawhelp.org . One study in New Orleans found that more than 65% of tenants with no legal representation were evicted, compared with fewer than 15% of those who did have a lawyer. Yes. The CDC's order doesn't relieve you of your obligation to pay rent. You want to try your hardest to keep up with your bills during the pandemic to avoid racking up debt and being evicted come July. Between the federal stimulus package passed in December and the one that passed this month, there's now more than $45 billion in financial assistance available to those who've fallen behind on their rent. Get in line for the funds as soon as possible. "Where or how to apply will vary city by city," Benfer said. Many areas already had existing rental assistance funds , and it will be through one of these that you apply for the new aid. In other cases, new programs will be created to disburse the money, Benfer said. "Renters should contact local housing groups , their representatives or the local 211/311 lines to identify programs and learn how to apply," she added. The National Low Income Housing Coalition has a database of rental assistance programs, too. At Justshelter.org, you can search for other community resources for people struggling to pay their rent.
President Joe Biden will outline his more than $2 trillion infrastructure and economic recovery proposal on Wednesday. The plan includes several initiatives to reduce racial inequities in transportation, housing and job training. Democrats aim to approve the plan by this summer, but a lack of Republican support could complicate the process.	The Biden administration aims to reduce racial inequities in transportation, housing and job training as part of its more than $2 trillion infrastructure plan outlined Wednesday. President Joe Biden made the case for his second major legislative initiative during a speech in Pittsburgh on Wednesday. Through the package, the White House hopes to create millions of jobs, revitalize American transportation and make buildings and utilities more resilient against climate change. The plan includes several proposals designed to curb longstanding racial inequities exacerbated by transportation projects and zoning policies around the country. It would also invest in historically Black colleges and universities, along with job training programs for marginalized communities. The Biden administration push to include racial equity plans in the recovery package follows passage of a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill that aimed to better distribute economic relief and health-care resources to communities of color hurt most by the pandemic. The unemployment rate for Black and Hispanic Americans was higher than the rate for all workers in February, according to government data , and Black and Hispanic households faced a higher risk of eviction than white households as of late last year, according to a Brookings Institution survey released in December. Democrats, who narrowly control both chambers of Congress but are unlikely to win Republican support, hope to pass the infrastructure proposal by this summer. It is unclear now how much party leaders would have to change it in order to win enough votes to approve it. Democrats may have to use budget reconciliation, which would allow them to pass the legislation with no GOP support. The infrastructure plan would put $20 billion into transportation in communities isolated or damaged by past projects. The White House pointed to cities including New Orleans and Syracuse, N.Y., where Black businesses and homes were razed to build highways that now divide cities. The White House called for $20 billion in tax credits to build or rehabilitate 500,000 homes in underserved communities. The Biden administration proposal also aims to curb exclusionary zoning laws, including restrictions on multifamily housing units, which have often contributed to racial segregation and higher prices. Biden's proposal would award grants to cities and states that implement more equitable zoning. Due to zoning and other policies, communities of color are also more likely to live in areas vulnerable to extreme weather. The White House aims to invest in making housing, utilities, food infrastructure and transportation in those communities more resilient against climate change and weather damage. The proposal also calls to invest $25 billion in HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions for research and development, along with programs including graduate fellowships. The $100 billion for workforce development included in the plan would seek to reduce racial inequities in job training and hiring. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., signaled early opposition to President Joe Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure overhaul plan, saying it's "not likely" he would support it. "It's like a Trojan horse," McConnell told reporters in Kentucky. "It's called infrastructure, but inside the Trojan horse it's going to be more borrowed money, and massive tax increases on all the productive parts of our economy." McConnell also said that Biden called him Tuesday to brief him about the proposal.	Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Wednesday took an early swipe at President Joe Biden' s infrastructure overhaul , decrying the "massive" tax increases in the roughly $2 trillion plan and fretting about its impact on the national debt. McConnell, who has opposed prior administrations' attempts to pass new infrastructure spending through the Senate, said he was unlikely to support Biden's ambitious new proposal. "It's like a Trojan horse," McConnell told reporters in Erlanger, Kentucky, on Wednesday morning. "It's called infrastructure, but inside the Trojan horse it's going to be more borrowed money, and massive tax increases on all the productive parts of our economy." The Republican leader said that if the plan is "going to have massive tax increases and trillions more added to the national debt, it's not likely" he would support it. McConnell also said that Biden called him Tuesday to brief him on the plan. It's the second time the two men have spoken since Biden's inauguration, according to NBC News. Biden on Wednesday afternoon unveiled the plan in Pittsburgh, known as "the Steel City" for its once-towering status as a leading manufacturing hub. The White House says the legislation is just the first part of a double-barreled, multitrillion-dollar economy recovery plan. The second leg of the plan, which will involve huge investments in U.S. health care and child care, is likely to be revealed later in April. The infrastructure plan includes about $2 trillion in spending over eight years, the White House said. The legislation would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, which, in concert with other proposed reforms, would fund the new spending over 15 years, according to the White House. Biden's plan would also raise the global minimum tax rate for multinational corporations to 21% and eliminate a current tax exemption on profits on foreign investments, the administration said. "This is not to target those who've made it. Not to seek retribution. This is about opening opportunities for everybody else," Biden said in Pittsburgh. "And here's the truth: We all will do better when we all do well." Those tax proposals would fund a suite of far-reaching infrastructure projects. The Biden plan would invest $620 billion into transportation efforts, including repairing thousands of bridges, expanding public transit, prioritizing electric vehicles and taking steps to account for the effects of climate change. Billions more would go toward delivering universal broadband access, replacing every lead pipe and service line in the nation, and laying thousands of miles of transmission lines. The plan would also direct $400 billion to care for elderly and disabled Americans, and inject huge sums into upgrading drinking water infrastructure, homes and schools. Lawmakers from both parties have long pushed to revitalize America's aging infrastructure — but the tax hikes and the Biden plan's massive price tag are likely to draw strong opposition from the GOP. McConnell in Kentucky on Wednesday expressed concern about U.S. debt levels, saying "we've reached a critical point here." "I hope we're not beginning to engage in the habit of anytime we want to do something call it a national emergency and run up the national debt," McConnell said. "Not to mention, plans that may be in the works in the future, including one the President is going to announce apparently today in Pittsburgh." In a statement following Biden's speech, McConnell accused Democrats of "trying to use important issues as smokescreens for unrelated agendas." Democrats, meanwhile, are already applauding the infrastructure package. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement Wednesday said that the plan addresses "the right combination" of issues "to meet head on the challenges that America now faces." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., reportedly told the Democratic caucus that she would like to pass the package in her chamber by July 4.
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan announced on Wednesday that he will dismiss members of two key science advisory committees picked by former President Donald Trump. The decision will oust researchers whose work helped advance the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations. The move is part of the Biden administration's broader effort to restore morale at the EPA after Trump consistently dismissed the scientific consensus that humans are causing climate change.	Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan said Wednesday he will dismiss members of two key science advisory committees picked by former President Donald Trump , a move he said will help restore scientific integrity and trust in the agency. The decision will oust researchers with The Science Advisory Board and the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee whose work helped advance the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations in favor of fossil fuel producers. The move is also part of the Biden administration's broader effort to restore morale and scientific integrity at the EPA after Trump, who dismissed the scientific consensus that humans are causing climate change and sought to make the agency more favorable to deregulation. For instance, the agency recently re-established a webpage dedicated to climate change that Trump deleted four years ago. And in a memo to staff last week, Regan said the EPA is reviewing years of environmental policies and decisions by the Trump administration to see where scientific data might have been purposefully manipulated or suppressed. "Resetting these two scientific advisory committees will ensure the agency receives the best possible scientific insight to support our work to protect human health and the environment," Regan said in a statement on Wednesday. "Today we return to a time-tested, fair, and transparent process for soliciting membership to these critically important advisory bodies," he added. Many EPA experts left the agency under the Trump administration, which rolled back more than 100 environmental rules in four years. Regan has said he wouldn't rule out the possibility for those workers to return to the agency. The agency is now seeking new applications for the two panels. The EPA plays a critical role in Biden's agenda to decarbonize the electricity sector by 2035 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
Facebook removed a video interview with Donald Trump, a company spokesperson confirmed to NBC News on Wednesday, citing the former president's indefinite suspension from the platform. The removal tests just how far Facebook is willing to interpret its suspension, which followed the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. An email posted by Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, said that "content posted on Facebook and Instagram in the voice of President Trump is not currently allowed on our platform."	Facebook removed a video featuring former President Donald Trump, a company spokesperson confirmed to NBC News on Wednesday, citing the former president's indefinite suspension from the platform. The removal tests just how far Facebook is willing to interpret its suspension, which followed the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. The video featuring Trump was posted by his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who was interviewing the former president. Lara Trump had teased the interview in an Instagram photo of the sit-down on Tuesday. An email Lara Trump posted to her Instagram account later on Tuesday shows a message warning her team about uploading the video. The email reminded them that "content posted on Facebook and Instagram in the voice of President Trump is not currently allowed on our platform (including new posts with President Trump speaking) and will be removed if posted, resulting in additional limitations on accounts that posted it." A Facebook source confirmed the veracity of the email. A second email posted by Lara Trump said Facebook had removed the video once she had uploaded it to her page. "In line with the block we placed on Donald Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts, further content posted in the voice of Donald Trump will be removed and result in additional limitations on the accounts," the email said. The former president was initially banned from Facebook's services the day after the deadly riot fueled by his supporters following his false claims of election fraud. Facebook had said the ban would be indefinite and last at least through the remainder of his term. The company has since maintained the ban and said it's referring the matter to its independent oversight board to recommend whether the suspension should be lifted. Twitter has said its ban on Trump is permanent . A spokesperson for former President Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

The U.S. business community is trying to figure out how to address President Joe Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure plan, which calls for higher corporate taxes to help pay for it. Lobbyists and other D.C. influencers told CNBC that they have received calls from anxious corporate clients eager for guidance on the path forward. While several prominent business groups oppose the tax hikes, behind the scenes, some companies are considering whether to put up a fight at all because of the demand for an infrastructure bill.	The U.S. business community is trying to figure out how to address President Joe Biden 's infrastructure plan, which calls for higher corporate taxes to help pay for at least $2 trillion in government spending. Several prominent business groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, oppose the proposed tax hikes. Behind the scenes, though, some companies are considering whether to put up much of a fight because of corporate America's demand for an infrastructure overhaul, according to people familiar with the matter. Lobbyists and other D.C. influencers told CNBC that they have received calls from anxious corporate clients eager for guidance on the path forward. Some of the people declined to be named in this story in order to speak freely about ongoing private conversations. The White House unveiled the plan Wednesday , and Biden discussed it in remarks in Pittsburgh later in the day. It calls for raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%. "No one should be able to complain about that," Biden said during his remarks when discussing any possible concerns with raising the corporate tax rates. In some cases, corporate clients discussed with lobbyists potentially negotiating with the White House and congressional Democrats potential tradeoffs for raising the corporate rate to 28%, according to a lobbyist who represents tech giants and Wall Street banks. One of the ideas being floated behind the scenes is to persuade Congress to find a middle ground on global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI. According to the Tax Policy Center, GILTI is the "income earned by foreign affiliates of US companies from intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights." The minimum GILTI tax is set at 10.5%.  Biden wants to raise the minimum rate to 21% . Other corporations have told their lobbyists to persuade moderate Democrats in Congress to back a 25% corporate tax rate instead of 28%. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who represents GOP-friendly West Virginia and is a crucial swing vote in the evenly split Senate, has called for raising the corporate rate to about 25% instead of 28%. One lobbyist told CNBC that several of his clients appeared to be divided on whether they will push back on the tax increase proposal because corporate America has long hoped for a massive infrastructure bill. "I think they're all over the place because I think there's a lot of money being spent in ways that will be attractive to a lot of companies," another corporate lobbyist told CNBC. "If you are involved in broadband, electric vehicles, you go down the list, there's a lot of positive spending that corporate America will like." This lobbyist represents auto and airline giants, along with large private equity firms. "On the other side, nobody likes a corporate tax increase," this lobbyist added. Other lobbyists said their clients would defer to business advocacy groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable and the RATE Coalition. The RATE Coalition lists on its website a slew of corporate giants as its members, including FedEx, Capital One, Altria, Lockheed Martin and Toyota. The group advocates keeping the corporate tax rate at 21%. A person familiar with the matter told CNBC that the group is "prepared to spend what's needed" against Biden's corporate tax rate proposal. Former Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., a leader of RATE, pushed back on Biden's proposed new corporate rate and called on Congress and the administration to focus on closing tax loopholes instead. "I urge my former colleagues in Congress and friends in the administration to eliminate the loopholes that enable profitable companies to pay little or nothing in taxes," she told CNBC. FedEx later told CNBC that, while they were in favor of raising gas and diesel taxes, they opposed the increase in the corporate tax rate as a way to pay for infrastructure reform. "FedEx supports federal investment in infrastructure through both increases in gasoline and diesel taxes and – in the future – user-style fees on the beneficiaries of the system," Isabel Rollison, a company spokeswoman, told CNBC. " We do not believe increasing the corporate tax rate and broadening the base is the right strategy for infrastructure funding since such changes impact the country's economic competitiveness and have a more detrimental impact on U.S. GDP." The Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable also publicly criticized the idea of raising the corporate rate. This comes as many other outside groups were preparing for an all-out war against Biden's tax concepts. A business advocacy group, which declined to be named because it is still in its campaign planning stages, had already been in the process of conducting TV ad buys that will, in part, push back on Biden's corporate tax rate. The fossil fuel industry is targeted in the Biden plan. The administration said it would fund part of the spending by eliminating tax credits and subsidies for fossil fuel producers. The American Petroleum Institute, which is the oil and gas industry's largest trade group, opposes using taxes to pay for the plan. "Targeting specific industries with new taxes would only undermine the nation's economic recovery and jeopardize good-paying jobs, including union jobs," said API's senior vice president of policy and regulatory affairs, Frank Macchiarola. "It's important to note that our industry receives no special tax treatment, and we will continue to advocate for a tax code that supports a level playing field for all economic sectors along with policies that sustain and grow the billions of dollars in government revenue that we help generate." API has dozens of members including energy giants such as Chevron, BP and Shell. API previously endorsed a price on planet-warming carbon emissions , marking a major shift after it long resisted regulatory action on climate change.
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, wants regulators to take a look at the Archegos meltdown. The committee has jurisdiction over the world's largest banks and regularly engages with the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Brown is the latest lawmaker to speak out on the incident. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, also a member of the banking committee, told CNBC that the meltdown "had all the makings of a dangerous situation."	Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Democratic chairman of the powerful Senate Banking Committee, is setting his sights on Archegos Capital Management after the fund's recent losses sent shockwaves through markets. "Once again, investment banks put profits first and enabled risky derivatives trading that resulted in billions of dollars in losses," Brown said in a statement to CNBC on Wednesday. "We must make sure our financial watchdogs work together to protect the financial system and our economy. I expect the SEC and other regulators to take a closer look." The committee has jurisdiction over the world's largest banks and regularly engages with the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Brown is the latest lawmaker to speak out on the incident. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , who is also a member of the Banking Committee, told CNBC on Tuesday that "Archegos' meltdown had all the makings of a dangerous situation." The disastrous trades last week by Archegos, a family office founded by former Tiger Management analyst Bill Hwang , sent the stock of ViacomCBS and many others into a downward spiral. By the time Credit Suisse and Nomura , two prime brokers for Archegos, announced early Monday that they faced losses that could be "highly significant" for the banks, rival firms Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had already finished unloading their positions, according to people with knowledge of the matter. They requested anonymity in order to speak about private negotiations. Goldman managed to sell most of the stock related to its Archegos margin calls on Friday, helping the firm avoid any losses in the episode, according to one of the people. Morgan Stanley sold $15 billion in shares over a few days, avoiding significant losses, CNBC's Leslie Picker reported.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he sees Republican opposition to President Joe Biden's infrastructure plan, and vowed to fight the broader Democratic agenda. The comment all but assures Democrats would have to pass a more than $2 trillion infrastructure proposal on their own, unless they make major changes to win Republican support. The proposal outlined Wednesday invests in roads, bridges, airports, electric vehicles, broadband and water systems, and raises the corporate tax rate to 28% to offset the spending.	Any hopes that Washington could scrape together a bipartisan infrastructure package took a hit Thursday. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters the more than $2 trillion plan the White House unveiled Wednesday "is not going to get support from our side." The proposal would invest in roads, bridges, airports, broadband, water systems, electric vehicles and job training programs, and raise the corporate tax rate to 28% to offset the spending. The Republican also vowed to oppose the broader Democratic agenda under President Joe Biden , who passed his first major initiative last month in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. "I'm going to fight them every step of the way, because I think this is the wrong prescription for America," McConnell said at a news conference in Kentucky. Unless 10 Republicans break with McConnell or Biden revises the plan to win GOP votes, his comment all but assures Democrats would have to use budget reconciliation to pass the infrastructure bill on their own. Biden has said he wants to win GOP support for the plan. But Republicans have opposed any tax increases, saying they could hinder the U.S. economic recovery. Responding to McConnell on Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki questioned whether the Republican Senate leader agrees that the U.S. needs to update its infrastructure and expand broadband access. She said Democrats and Republicans need to resolve differences over how to pay for the investments. "If you don't want to raise the corporate tax rate — still lower than it's been over the last 70 years and across decades — if you don't want to do that, if you don't want to put in place a global minimum tax, what are the alternatives? We're happy to hear those proposals," she said. Even if they use reconciliation, Democrats will have to balance competing interests among themselves to approve a bill. Some progressive lawmakers have called to include more ambitious measures to fight climate change in the plan. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and other lawmakers from New York and New Jersey have pushed to include a repeal of the cap on state and local tax deductions in the plan. The change is expected to benefit higher-income taxpayers. Biden and his advisors got initial Republican input on the Covid relief package, then moved to pass it on their own when they realized the GOP would accept only a much smaller bill than they sought. They appear to be taking a similar approach on infrastructure. "We'll have a good-faith negotiation with any Republican who wants to help get this done. But we have to get it done," Biden said when unveiling the infrastructure plan in Pittsburgh on Wednesday. Biden announced Thursday that a team of five Cabinet officials would take charge of engaging with Congress about the infrastructure plan, working out the details of the proposal and pitching it to the public. The five officials are Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Biden said at the start of his first Cabinet meeting. No Republicans in Congress voted for Biden's broadly popular Covid plan. Corralling GOP support for another multitrillion-dollar bill — which includes tax hikes — appears more challenging. "The odds are longer for Republican support on this," said Howard Fineman, an MSNBC contributor and a correspondent for RealClearPolitics, in a phone interview. "The last thing was about fighting a disease, for God's sake, and they couldn't get any Republicans to vote for it," Fineman said. "This has less emotional heft in that sense."

It is unclear if the Biden administration will include a health insurance public option, a key campaign proposal from President Joe Biden, in his upcoming economic recovery plan. His chief of staff, Ron Klain, said Biden plans to address health-care affordability and coverage in the bill, but did not specify whether he would include a public option in it. Democrats would likely have to pass a public option without Republican support, though there are disagreements within the party about how best to expand coverage.	While President Joe Biden tries to steer his mammoth new infrastructure plan through Congress, his administration is planning the next phase of its economic recovery efforts. As the White House prepares to unveil a second proposal focused on education, paid leave and health care, it has given few hints about whether it will include a core Biden campaign plank: a public insurance option. The president ran on expanding health-care coverage by allowing Americans to opt into a Medicare-like plan. Though the White House has said it will address health care in the new proposal due to be unveiled later this month, it has not yet committed to including a public option. "Health care will certainly be a part of that, with a focus on trying to lower costs for most Americans, particularly around prescription drugs, and efforts also to expand affordable health care," White House chief of staff Ron Klain told Politico on Thursday when asked if the proposal would include the Medicare-like insurance plan. Biden entered the White House with full Democratic control of Congress and a chance to enact major pieces of his platform. Taking office during a pandemic and economic downturn, and facing GOP resistance to many of his goals in a Senate where the filibuster still exists, Biden had to make thorny decisions about what to pursue and when. Democrats started Biden's term with three chances to use budget reconciliation, the process that allows bills to pass with a simple majority in the Senate. It means Democrats can approve legislation with no GOP votes in the evenly split chamber. Because Republicans will oppose efforts to expand government involvement in health care, Democrats would likely have to pass a public option on their own. But health-care reform has befuddled the major political parties in Washington for decades. Democrats would still have to get all of their members on board with a health plan. It could prove difficult in a party where preferred models range from a modified version of Obamacare to a full single-payer system that covers every American. Democrats used their first shot at reconciliation to pass a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill — a bigger aid package than they could have approved if Republicans had signed on. Democrats may also opt to use the process to pass the more than $2 trillion infrastructure plan Biden unveiled Wednesday. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., said Republicans would oppose it because it raises taxes on corporations. Passing infrastructure through reconciliation would leave Democrats with one more attempt to pass a bill with a simple majority by next year, though Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said he hopes to find a way to use the process an additional time. Senators have already called on Biden to use his next recovery plan to expand health-care coverage. Sens. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., have urged Biden to put their health-care expansion plan in the coming reconciliation bill. They believe their legislation reflects the president's goal he outlined on the campaign trail. It would set up a Medicare public option for individuals and small businesses nationwide by 2025. The bill would also put in place cost-cutting measures, such as allowing the government to negotiate drug prices and expanding subsidies and tax credits for purchasing coverage. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has his own idea of how Biden should approach health care in the reconciliation bill. He wants to lower the Medicare eligibility age to either 60 or 55, from the current 65, and expand coverage to dental and vision. He aims to fund the change by allowing Medicare to directly negotiate prices with drug companies. It is unclear now whether Biden will include a public option in the reconciliation bill, or how he would otherwise use the plan to cut costs and expand coverage. He faces political pressure to take action on health care during his first term, as voters in 2020 consistently ranked the issue among the most important to them. The pandemic also highlighted weaknesses in the U.S. health-care system. Millions of people who lost jobs as the virus spread around the country lost their employer-sponsored insurance. To address the loss of coverage, the Biden administration opened a special Affordable Care Act enrollment period. As part of the Covid relief package, Congress also made made millions more people eligible for premium subsidies to buy plans. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
While other corporate giants such as Coca-Cola and Delta have been quick to oppose the Georgia voting law, film studios in the state have been less vocal. Some speculate the industry is hoping the federal government will intervene, while executives express their concerns behind the scenes and pull other levers such as the use of political donations. But another factor could be timing: Amid the coronavirus pandemic, studios are simply unable to make threats that could disrupt production.	While other corporate giants such as Coca-Cola and Delta have been quick to oppose Georgia's new voting law , film studios in the state have been less vocal. In the past, Hollywood has used the threat of production boycotts in the state to make clear its opinions about Georgia's politics. However, this time around, studios have been largely mum on the matter, leading many to wonder why. Some speculate the industry is hoping the federal government will intervene, while executives express their concerns behind the scenes or pull other levers such as the use of political donations. But another factor could be timing: Amid the coronavirus pandemic, studios are simply unable to make threats that could disrupt production. "As a Georgia resident and business owner I've been here a few times with the anti-abortion bill and the LGBTQ discrimination bill," said Tyler Perry, who owns Tyler Perry Studios in Georgia, in a statement Tuesday. "They all sent a shockwave through Georgia and the nation but none of them managed to succeed. I'm resting my hope in the [Department of Justice] taking a hard look at this unconstitutional voter suppression law that harkens to the Jim Crow era." The new law, which was signed by Gov. Brian Kemp on March 26, includes a restriction on drop boxes, makes it a crime to provide food or water to voters lined up outside polling stations, requires mandatory proof of identity for absentee voting and creates greater legislative control over how elections are run. Opponents say these provisions will disproportionately disenfranchise people of color. On Wednesday, ViacomCBS became the first major entertainment corporation to publicly condemn the law. "We unequivocally believe in the importance of all Americans having an equal right to vote and oppose the recent Georgia voting rights law or any effort that impedes the ability to exercise this vital constitutional right," the company posted on Twitter. AT&T, which owns Warner Media, also made a statement about the law. "AT&T believes our right to vote is among the most sacrosanct we enjoy, and that free enterprise and companies like ours thrive where elections are open and secure," the company said in a statement. "Consistent with that belief, we are working with other companies that are members of the Georgia Chamber and Metro-Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, as those organizations support policies that promote accessible and secure voting while also upholding election integrity and transparency." Neither company threatened to boycott the state. Some have speculated that Hollywood's silence reflects the industry's challenges. It can't afford to boycott the state's filming locations after losing months of production to the coronavirus pandemic. Others think Hollywood executives may just be waiting for more information before making statements. After all, it took a few weeks after 2019's anti-abortion bill, known as the "Heartbeat Law," was signed before most actors, producers and directors began to threaten boycotts in the state. A federal judge struck down the law last year. "I think the entertainment industry is sitting this one out until the federal government brings the voting rights [law] to the floor," said Tom Nunan, a lecturer at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television and founder of the production company Bull's Eye Entertainment. "It's a murky mess, and knowing the Hollywood culture as I do, I suspect leaders, especially Disney , who has the biggest footprint in Georgia due to the Marvel franchise of films and series, are waiting for the federal response," he said. Disney didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Sony officials also weren't immediately available. Hollywood has a lot of weight to throw around. The state gets just under $3 billion in direct spending from film and TV production, and another $6.5 billion in additional economic impact. This money goes to hotels, restaurants, gas stations, vehicle rentals and lumber purchases, all things needed for companies to make and produce their projects. Since 2008, enticing tax incentives have turned the state into "Y'allywood," a production hub for film and television. Georgia has developed infrastructure for big-budget productions and is home to a tremendously skilled workforce of crew members, craftsmen and technicians. Ryan Millsap, CEO of Blackhall Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, told CNBC that production is "booming" in the state even with additional Covid protocols. He said there are more productions in Georgia than there has ever been and studios have actually had to turn down companies looking for studio space. While the threat of boycotts can be an effective bargaining chip, halting production would also hurt the local crews and other businesses that rely on that income. "The threats of boycott have been pretty minimal at this time," said Molly Coffee, creative director of Film Impact Georgia and a film industry veteran based in the state. "James Mangold made a statement on Twitter that he would not shoot in Georgia and that has been repeated by folks like Mark Hamill and Debra Messing. The fear is always that others will follow suit." Russell Williams, professor of film and media arts at American University, suggested that there are other ways that Hollywood could make itself heard. "Hollywood bears the added costs of protecting their workforce and patrons (where applicable) with fewer ways to recoup that investment due to the pandemic, so maybe there are more targeted ways to get [legislators'] attention," he said. "Donation negation, anyone?" Hollywood's elite opened their wallets to fund the Senate runoff races in Georgia earlier this year. Federal Election Commission filings show that celebrities including Mark Ruffalo, Jack Black, Jane Fonda, Susan Sarandon and Tracee Ellis Ross doled out money ahead of the January election.
President Joe Biden warned Americans that progress on vaccinations and the economy can still be reversed if they don't moderate their behaviors to stop the spread of Covid-19. The comments came on the heels of a jobs report that blew past expectations in terms of the number of nonfarm jobs added for the month. The President discussed his new $2 trillion infrastructure package unveiled on Wednesday as a way to ensure that the country continues to create jobs and strengthen the economy.	President Joe Biden delivered a warning even as he touted Friday's exceptionally positive jobs report and the accelerating pace of vaccinations in the U.S.: progress can still be reversed if Americans don't moderate their behaviors to stop the spread of Covid-19. "Too many Americans are acting as if this fight is over," Biden said. "It is not." The comments came on the heels of the news that nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month , smashing economist expectations of an increase of 675,000, according to a Dow Jones survey. Biden also announced that the U.S. set a record for Thursday vaccinations to cap off the first seven-day period where the country administered 20 million shots. But the President reminded Americans there is still a long way to go when it comes to both rebuilding the economy and ending the pandemic. "While the earliest signs from this job report announcing today are promising and the American Rescue Plan is starting to make a real difference, today's report also reminds us how deep a hole we started in," Biden said. "After a year of devastation, there are still 8.4 million fewer jobs today than there were last March." When it comes to containing the virus, Biden urged Americans "to buckle down and keep their guard up in this home stretch." The President discussed his new $2 trillion infrastructure package unveiled on Wednesday as a way to ensure that the country continues to create jobs and strengthen the economy. The package has already faced pushback from Republicans, some of whom claim the bill is too sweeping, while some progressives from his own party think it does not go far enough. Biden said he's open to discussion of his proposals, but that Congress must act. "Changes to my plan are certain. But inaction is not an option," he said. Despite Republican resistance to his infrastructure package, Biden said he thinks lawmakers will be urged by their constituents to act. "I think the Republicans' voters are going to have a lot to say about whether we get a lot of this done," he said. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube. WATCH: President Biden unveiled his $2 trillion infrastructure plan — Here's what's in the proposal
Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri on Sunday urged the Biden administration to cut the $2 trillion infrastructure plan to roughly $615 billion and focus on rebuilding physical infrastructure. Blunt is the fourth-highest ranking Republican in the Senate. Biden has said that he wants bipartisan support for the plan, but Republicans have staunchly opposed any tax hikes, arguing they could hinder economic recovery. Democrats would need to use the budget reconciliation process to pass the bill on their own unless the White House changes the proposal to satisfy Republicans.	Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri on Sunday urged the Biden administration to cut its $2 trillion infrastructure plan to roughly $615 billion and focus on rebuilding physical infrastructure like roads and bridges. In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Blunt – the fourth-ranking Republican in the Senate – argued that only 30% of the president's proposal focuses on traditional infrastructure and said reducing the price would allow the White House to pass the bill through both chambers of Congress. "I think there's an easy win here for the White House if they would take that win, which is make this an infrastructure package, which is about 30% — even if you stretch the definition of infrastructure some — it's about 30% of the $2.25 trillion we are talking about spending," Blunt said. "If we'd go back and look at roads and bridges and ports and airports, and maybe even underground water systems and broadband, you'd still be talking about less than 30% of this entire package," he added. "I think 30% is about 615 or so billion dollars," Blunt said. "I think you can do that and with some innovative things like looking at how we're going to deal with the electric vehicle use of the highway system, what we can do with public-private partnerships." The top Republican's remarks follow Biden's introduction of the infrastructure package last week, which focuses on rebuilding roads, bridges and airports, expanding broadband access and fighting climate change through boosting electric vehicle use and updating the country's electric grid. The proposal also includes increasing the corporate tax rate to 28% to offset spending. Biden has said that he wants bipartisan support for the plan, but the chances are slim. Republicans have staunchly opposed any tax hikes, arguing they could hinder economic recovery. Republicans have also criticized the package for including initiatives that extend beyond traditional infrastructure issues. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said last week that the $2 trillion package would not receive Republican support and vowed to oppose the broader Democratic agenda . "I'm going to fight them every step of the way, because I think this is the wrong prescription for America," McConnell said at a news conference on Thursday. Democrats would need to use the budget reconciliation process to pass the bill on their own unless the White House changes the proposal to satisfy Republicans or 10 Senate Republicans break with McConnell. The Biden administration passed the $1.9 pandemic relief package in March without a Republican vote through budget reconciliation and could take a similar approach with infrastructure. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on Sunday that she hopes the proposal passes with bipartisan support, but added that Biden is prepared to use reconciliation without Republicans. "So much of this includes priorities that Republicans have supported, so I hope that Democrats and Republicans can be on the final vote 'yes' on this package," Granholm said during an interview on CNN. Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, said on Sunday that Biden's infrastructure plan is key to spurring job growth as the country recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. "Let's also think for the longer term, about where those investments that we can make that will really drive not just more job growth but better job growth," Deese said in an interview with Fox News. "Not just job growth in the short term but job growth for long term, by investing in our infrastructure."
A former staffer for Rep. Matt Gaetz said FBI agents contacted him last week, shortly after news broke that the Florida Republican was embroiled in a federal sex-trafficking investigation. Ex-aide Nathan Nelson said two agents questioned him at his house after they had heard from members of the media that Nelson knew of Gaetz's alleged involvement in illegal activities. Gaetz in a new op-ed declared that he is "absolutely not resigning" from Congress and "will not be intimidated or extorted" by his political opponents.	One of Rep. Matt Gaetz's former staffers said Monday that FBI agents contacted him last week, shortly after news broke that the Florida Republican was embroiled in a federal sex-trafficking investigation . Nathan Nelson, Gaetz's former director of military affairs, said two agents questioned him at his house after they had heard from members of the media that Nelson knew of Gaetz's alleged involvement in illegal activities. The media tipsters told the FBI that Nelson resigned as a result of that knowledge, the ex-aide said. "I'm here to state this morning that nothing could be further from the truth," Nelson said at a press conference in northwest Florida. "Neither I, nor any other member of Congressman Gaetz's staff had any knowledge of illegal activities." Nelson  said his departure from Gaetz's office last fall was not related to the Department of Justice's probe of allegations against the 38-year-old congressman. The investigation into whether Gaetz trafficked an underage girl began in the final months of former President Donald Trump's term, The New York Times reported Tuesday . In response to CNBC's report on Nelson's remarks, Gaetz slammed the FBI, claiming the agency is "literally running down false media rumors." "Sound familiar?" Gaetz added. He and other Republicans have in recent years accused government agencies and officials of bias against conservatives. Gaetz in 2019 accused special counsel Robert Mueller, who led the investigation of Russian interference and potential collusion with Trump's campaign in the 2016 election, of trying to "stop Trump ." That investigation, which found insufficient evidence to conclude Trump-Russia collusion, has since become a potent symbol for Republicans who feel targeted by government institutions. The FBI did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Meanwhile, Gaetz in a new op-ed declared that he is "absolutely not resigning" from Congress and "will not be intimidated or extorted" by his political opponents. Gaetz, an outspoken Trump loyalist, has previously denied having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and paying for her travels with him, and he remained defiant in the op-ed Monday morning. "Since I'm taking my turn under the gun, let me address the allegations against me directly. First, I have never, ever paid for sex. And second, I, as an adult man, have not slept with a 17-year-old," Gaetz wrote in the Washington Examiner . Last week, Gaetz said in a statement that he and his family are being threatened in a multimillion-dollar extortion scheme involving a former Justice Department official. Law enforcement officials told NBC News that the DOJ is pursuing a separate probe into Gaetz's claims of being extorted. The sex-trafficking investigation involving Gaetz grew out of another case related to his onetime associate, Joel Greenberg, a local official in Florida who last summer was indicted on numerous charges, including sex trafficking of a child. Nelson said at the press conference that he had been approached by the federal agents the day after the Times' first report on alleged sex trafficking. The former Gaetz aide said he knows nothing specific about the investigation and had never heard of Greenberg prior to last week's reports. But the "baseless claim" that prompted the FBI to approach him "leaves me further convinced" that the allegations against Gaetz "are likewise fabricated," Nelson said. Another Gaetz staffer, communications director Luke Ball, resigned last week. Nelson worked in Gaetz's office for more than four years before leaving last October, according to his LinkedIn profile. He said Monday that his departure was planned. Nelson told reporters he is still "loosely affiliated" with Gaetz's office as a military advisor "in an unpaid capacity," but said he hasn't spoken to Gaetz in "several months." Gaetz's office had arranged Nelson's press conference.
The proposed increase is part of the administration's effort to fund its $2 trillion infrastructure proposal. While politicians in both parties agree that American roads and bridges are in need of extensive repair, fierce disagreements over other priorities and the ultimate size of the bill remain. Conservative Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia reportedly said Monday that he opposes the White House plan if it would raise the corporate tax to 28%.	President Joe Biden said Monday he is not worried that a plan to increase corporate America's tax bill would dampen the U.S. economy as it emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic. Asked whether he is concerned that the White House plan to raise the corporate rate to 28% could harm an already-fragile recovery, Biden replied "not at all." "There's no evidence of that," the president said from the South Lawn of the White House. "Here you have 51 or 52 corporations in the Fortune 500 that haven't paid a single penny in taxes for three years." The proposed increase to the corporate rate is part of the administration's effort to fund its $2 trillion infrastructure proposal, a plan many Democrats promised to pass during the 2020 election cycle. But while politicians in both parties agree that American roads and bridges are in need of extensive repair, fierce disagreements over other priorities and the ultimate size of the bill remain. Biden and progressive Democrats favor spending, including $621 billion in transportation infrastructure, $400 billion to care for elderly and disabled Americans, $300 billion for improving drinking water and broadband access and another $300 billion in building and retrofitting affordable housing. Republicans, who broadly opposed Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid relief package last month, say the president should deflate the current legislation and almost unanimously oppose edits to the tax cuts passed by former President Donald Trump. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, widely viewed as his landmark legislative victory, lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, which at the time was one of the highest rates among developed economies. Biden's infrastructure plan would partially roll back Trump's plan by increasing the rate to 28%. Republicans worry that raising the corporate rate so soon after reducing it could make the U.S. a less attractive option to businesses considering where to locate new factories, jobs and profits. For much of the past 30 years, U.S. corporations have tried to save on taxes by reincorporating in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland and other offshore tax havens where the corporate rates are lower. Even conservative Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said Monday that he opposes the White House plan if it would raise the corporate tax to 28%. He did signal that he could be open to a partial rollback of Trump's corporate tax cut to 25% versus the 28% proposed by Biden. "As the bill exists today, it needs to be changed," Manchin told Hoppy Kercheval, the host of West Virginia Metro News's "Talkline" show. "I think [the corporate rate] should have never been under 25%, that's the worldwide average. And that's what basically every corporation would have told you was fair." Manchin, routinely a key swing voter in a Senate split 50-50, could singlehandedly doom the infrastructure bill if Democrats opt to push the measure through Congress via budget reconciliation. Amid these concerns, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is leading an effort to inspire other nations to institute a minimum tax levy on corporations in order to ensure that no one nation gains a competitive advantage. "We are working with G-20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom," Yellen told the Chicago Council on Global Affairs on Monday in prepared remarks. "Together we can use a global minimum tax to make sure the global economy thrives based on a more level playing field in the taxation of multinational corporations, and spurs innovation, growth, and prosperity." It was unclear as of Monday afternoon if Manchin had heard Yellen's plan prior to his comments. The Biden plan would also increase the offshore profit tax rate to 21%, up from the Trump-era rate of 10.5%.
More than 1.3 million Americans are owed a tax refund from the IRS for 2017. They'll have to file a return quickly if they want the money. Some of these taxpayers may also be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit, which could be worth as much as $6,318.	The IRS is still holding more than $1.3 billion in unclaimed tax refunds for those who didn't file a return in 2017, the agency announced on Monday. The pot of money is owed to roughly 1.3 million Americans. IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig warned that time is running out for these taxpayers to get their refunds. "There's only a three-year window to claim these refunds, and the window closes on May 17," Rettig said in a statement. "We want to help people get these refunds, but they will need to quickly file a 2017 tax return." More from Personal Finance: Fourth stimulus checks aren't likely. What aid could be next There may still be a way to claim missing $1,200 or $600 stimulus checks How to make sure you don't miss $1,400 stimulus checks in the mail If a person fails to file a tax return within three years, any refund becomes property of the U.S. Treasury. The IRS announced last month that the federal income tax filing deadline would be extended to May 17, 2021 from April 15, 2021. The IRS also cautioned that people who didn't file a return in 2018 or 2019 may still not get their 2017 refund. And the refund can be applied to particular debts a person might owe, including on a student loan. Regardless, it's worth filing. Half of the tax refunds for 2017 that haven't been disbursed are for more than $865. And some low- and moderate-income workers would be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit, which in 2017 could be worth as much as $6,318. You can find instructions on filing a tax return for prior years on the IRS website . If you're missing any crucial forms, like a W-2 or 1099, you can request a copy from your employer, bank or other income provider. If that fails, you can try ordering a free wage and income transcript at IRS.gov, which should have the information you need to file your return.
State lawmakers sponsoring these bills have seen contributions from media giants Disney and Charter, prison behemoth the GEO Group, insurance company Geico and trip planner Expedia, along with CenturyLink and other massive corporations. Disney has contributed more than $8,000 to the campaigns of the three lawmakers sponsoring similar Florida voting bills, according to state campaign finance records reviewed by CNBC. Critics say that with these types of bills flowing through state legislatures across the country, corporations have to go further than putting out statements and hold back on campaign contributions.	Republican state lawmakers in Florida who received corporate support from Disney and other major companies during their campaigns are now sponsoring a slew of bills that could put restrictions on voting access in the key swing state. The Brennan Center for Justice lists three Florida proposals that it says, in their current form, would amount to voter restrictions. State lawmakers sponsoring these bills have seen contributions from media giants Disney and Charter, prison behemoth the GEO Group, insurance company Geico and trip planner Expedia, along with CenturyLink and other massive corporations. CenturyLink rebranded itself Lumen Technologies in 2020. These companies have so far remained silent on the issue of voting rights. Though former President Donald Trump defeated Joe Biden in Florida during the 2020 election, both parties have consistently put the state at the top of their election target lists. In last year's election, millions were spent in the state by billionaire Mike Bloomberg and others . The move by states to push ahead with new voting laws comes after Trump falsely claimed that the election was rigged against him and tried to overturn the results . The Florida bills range from putting restrictions on when election officers can use electronic poll books to having heightened security at drop boxes. Corporations have been under pressure to respond since Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed what critics deem a discriminatory law that would restrict minority communities' access to the polls. Major League Baseball announced it would move its All-Star Game out of Atlanta in protest. And several corporations have come out against the law, including Delta and Coca-Cola. Corporate executives, such as Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell,  have also responded to the proposed new voting laws out of Texas. Republican leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have pushed back on corporations that have recently spoken out. "Corporations will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far-left mobs to hijack our country from outside the constitutional order," McConnell said in a statement on Monday. "Businesses must not use economic blackmail to spread disinformation and push bad ideas that citizens reject at the ballot box." Still, beyond public statements from companies denouncing the voting bills, there is no indication so far that they will stop financing the campaigns of lawmakers crafting these proposals. A study by Public Citizen says that since 2015, corporations have given $50 million to "state legislators supporting voter suppression bills, including $22 million during the 2020 election cycle." Since 2018, Disney has contributed more than $8,000 to the campaigns of the three lawmakers sponsoring similar Florida voting bills, according to state campaign finance records reviewed by CNBC. The company did not respond to a request for comment on whether it will continue to back these lawmakers going forward or if it will lobby against the bills. The Public Citizen report says that since 2015, Disney has contributed $28,000 to various Florida state senators backing a bill that could suppress the vote. The Walt Disney World Resort is based in the Sunshine State. The GEO Group, which builds and invests in prisons across the country, has also been a major donor to Florida lawmakers sponsoring restrictive voting bills. GEO Group is headquartered in Florida. The company has given at least $3,000 since 2017 to state lawmakers sponsoring potential restrictive voting bills. Florida state records lists the campaign contributions coming through the GEO Care division, which, according to its website, "delivers comprehensive approaches to manage, rehabilitate and treat individuals inside secure settings and throughout the community." The Public Citizen report shows that GEO Group has contributed $19,000 to lawmakers who are backing a new voting bill. Geico, the insurance giant, gave at least $3,000 to one of the sponsors of a new voting bill, records show. The GEO Group, Expedia, Lumen and Geico did not respond to requests for comment. Charter declined to comment. As for the bills themselves, each one contains likely hurdles for voters and election officials if they are passed into law. One of the bills was filed on Jan. 14, days after the deadly riot on Capitol Hill and following Congress certifying Biden's Electoral College victory. Among the bill's many themes, it says , "beginning in 2022 and each election thereafter, an electronic poll book may not be used as a precinct register unless it is approved." An electronic poll book is often used by election officials to maintain information on voters. Any obstacles to gaining access to these types of devices could hinder election officials. Another bill introduced last month in the state House chamber is currently being reviewed by the Appropriations Committee. The bill calls for extra security at Florida drop boxes where voters can submit absentee ballots. "A secure drop box at an office of the supervisor must be monitored in person by an employee of the supervisor's office or a sworn law enforcement officer during regular office hours," the bill proposes. "During other hours, a secure drop box at an office of the supervisor may only be accessible if it is secured from tampering and monitored by video surveillance. The supervisor must keep recordings of video surveillance of such secure drop boxes and provide a copy to any candidate or political party submitting a written request for the recordings within 24 hours after receipt of such request," the bill goes on to say. The bill also says that voters using a drop box "must present his or her Florida driver license or Florida identification card to the employee or law enforcement officer monitoring the drop box. The employee or law enforcement officer must ensure that the address on the identification provided matches the printed residence address on the mailing envelope." NBC News reported in March that the same bill would prohibit the giving of "any item" at polling locations, similar to a provision in Georgia's new law. The third bill was recently criticized by the editorial board of the Miami Herald. The paper says the bill would limit vote-by-mail applications to one election cycle, while the current law allows Florida mail application requests to remain current for two general election cycles. Critics say that with these types of bills flowing through state legislatures across the country, corporations have to go further than putting out statements and hold back on campaign contributions. "Look at the deadly riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, the refusal to accept the election results, followed by the legislation to restrict the ability to vote. That has really stirred up people," said Bruce Freed, the president of the nonpartisan Center for Political Accountability, which tracks corporate money in politics. "Companies are ensnared in it because of the money they gave politically. They are seen as enabling it with their contributions."
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office says the Senate parliamentarian has ruled the chamber can use budget reconciliation an additional time to pass legislation without Republican votes. Democrats will now have three opportunities to approve a bill without GOP support before the 2022 midterm elections. The party is trying to pass President Joe Biden's more than $2 trillion infrastructure plan, and aims to push through an economic recovery bill after that.	Democrats may have just gotten a boost in getting their agenda through Congress. The Senate parliamentarian told Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that the chamber could use budget reconciliation an additional time to pass a bill with a simple majority, a spokesman for the New York Democrat said Monday. The ruling would give Democrats, who control a Senate split 50-50 by party, three attempts to approve legislation without Republican votes before the 2022 midterm elections. Democrats have not decided whether to use the third attempt at reconciliation. "No decisions have been made on a legislative path forward" and "some parameters still need to be worked out," but the opinion "is an important step forward," the Schumer spokesman said. The party has several proposals it could pursue with a simple majority. Democrats will try in the coming months to pass President Joe Biden 's more than $2 trillion infrastructure plan — which is facing GOP resistance. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said his caucus would likely oppose the measure due to the price tag and its call to hike the corporate tax rate to 28%. The GOP cut the rate to 21% from 35% in 2017. Another Republican senator urged the president to slash the infrastructure spending to about $600 billion. Democrats will also have to resolve issues within their own party. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., said Monday that he opposes a 28% corporate tax rate. The party will try to pass a separate economic recovery bill after it approves the infrastructure plan. The package, which could include expansions of paid leave and government-run health plans, will also likely face GOP resistance. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
Marc Bleicher, managing director at a cybersecurity consulting firm Arete Incident Response, helps companies deal with ransomware. He has given CNBC a rare and exclusive look inside a shadowy world where American companies find themselves paying millions of dollars to known criminals. According to a report by Chainalysis, the total amount paid by ransomware victims increased by 311% in 2020 to reach nearly $350 million worth of cryptocurrency.	Marc Bleicher is a hostage negotiator — but he's not trying to rescue human hostages, he's trying to rescue data. Bleicher, managing director at cybersecurity consulting firm Arete Incident Response, is a specialist who helps companies deal with ransomware — the type of cyberattack in which hackers lock up a company's computers and then demand payment to undo the encryption. He has given CNBC a rare and exclusive look inside a shadowy world where American companies find themselves paying millions of dollars to known criminals. It's a corner of the criminal underworld that has seen explosive growth. According to a report by Chainalysis, the total amount paid by ransomware victims increased by 336% in 2020 to reach nearly $370 million worth of cryptocurrency. And some big players are scoring huge gains: The report found the digital hostage-takers are dominated by large players who are raking in millions of dollars a year. Just 199 cryptocurrency deposit addresses receive 80 percent of all funds sent by ransomware addresses in 2020, Chainalysis found. All those payments have created an underground marketplace where criminals and their victims in corporate America must come together to reach terms and exchange funds. Ransomware has bedeviled small and large companies alike and is causing increasingly costly shutdowns at county governments, schools and even hospitals. In June, for example, Magellan Health announced it had been hit by an attack that ultimately impacted more than 300,000 people. The Clark County, Nevada, school district revealed an attack in August that may have exposed student data. And in July, the city of Lafayette, Colorado, paid a $45,000 ransom to regain control of its systems. Bleicher is a middleman in that economy, frequently finding himself with his fingers on a keyboard negotiating directly with the bad guys. He's also the person to send the payments when companies decide they have to pay the ransom. "Some clients are extremely angry," he told CNBC. "A lot of these victims are also in shock." But they all share one goal, he added: "to make the bleeding stop and make this go away as quickly as possible." Bleicher said he has overseen the payment of hundreds of millions of corporate dollars to criminal hackers, and that he is seeing ransom demands growing larger and larger. One hacker recently demanded $70 million from one of his clients, although he said the client found a way not to pay. But he explained that even ransom demands that high are almost always negotiable. The ransom note, like everything else in this business, is digital. "Your network has been infected!" blares the warning from a recent ransom note Bleicher shared with CNBC. "Follow the directions below but remember you don't have much time." The note featured a countdown clock, laid out a price, and warned: "If you do not pay on time, the price will be doubled." In this case, the hackers demanded payments in monero, a particularly hard to trace cryptocurrency favored by the hackers. In another real ransom note shared by Arete, the hackers said: "To unlock files you need to pay 3.8 bitcoin" — that's the equivalent of more than $200,000. "To confirm our honest intentions, we will unlock two files for free." It's alarming but persuasive warnings like these that are forcing companies to make the agonizing decision to ignore the FBI's warnings not to pay off the hackers. "Paying the ransom is always, always the last resort," Bleicher said. But for many companies, this is an existential threat. "I think at the end of the day that even, you know, the FBI would agree that some of these organizations really don't have any other options if they don't want to lose their business." The haggling takes place in a chat room on the dark web. Belicher said he doesn't know who's on the other side of his screen, but they already know a lot about his clients. For publicly traded companies, the hackers know annual revenues and calculate a ransom demand from there. And the hackers have total visibility into the organization: "They may have access to that company's financials from being inside their network," Bleicher said. But it's not just size that sets price — it's the sensitivity of the data: "That 10-person law firm may have, you know, politicians as clients, and therefore that ransom may be extremely high versus, you may have a Fortune 50 company where the ransom is lower, and because they only got to a certain portion of their data." Bleicher didn't want to go into detail about how he negotiates. But an official at another cybersecurity firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order not to draw undue attention from hackers, offered some insight. "We create fake profiles, so they don't know they are dealing with professional negotiators," the official told CNBC. "The profiles are usually midlevel employees, allowing us to delay and go back to a manager for approvals." And even as the negotiation is going on, the official said, the cybersecurity firm's goal may be to delay long enough to conduct an investigation or to extract information from the hackers about what they have and how much they know. "In some cases, we've been able to get full directory listings during the negotiations without paying," the official said. "Which helps us understand what systems the attacker has access to." Jason Kotler, founder and CEO of a cyber-negotiation company called Cypfer, said the criminals know what to expect. "They expect a negotiation," he said. "For billion dollar companies, they expect multimillion dollar payments." There's even something of an industry standard: "It's roughly a percentage of their published net revenues — a half a percent for billion dollar companies." "I wish I wasn't in the business I'm in," Kotler said. "It's really war. This is warfare." Sometimes warfare is not just a metaphor. Bleicher said companies can get comfortable with paying off crooks — but they don't want to pay terrorists or run afoul of US or Western sanctions. So the most important thing his company does is check with the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control to see if the entities they are paying have any connection to known sanctioned organizations. The goal is to make sure the victim companies don't accidentally break U.S. or European laws. The challenge is that on the dark web you can't always know for sure who you're dealing with. The North Korean military, Iranian intelligence and Russian oligarch connected cybercriminals are all vigorously involved in ransomware attacks. In February, for example, the Department of Justice unsealed charges against three North Korean programmers alleging that they participated in a wide-ranging criminal conspiracy to conduct a series of destructive cyberattacks and to steal and extort more than $1.3 billion of money and cryptocurrency from financial institutions and companies. The U.S. said the three men, Jon Chang Hyok, 31, Kim Il, 27 and Park Jin Hyok, 36, were members of an elite hacking unit of the North Korean military intelligence organization known as the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The U.S. charged the men with creating the destructive WannaCry 2.0 ransomware software in 2017 and "the extortion and attempted extortion of victim companies from 2017 through 2020 involving the theft of sensitive data." In late 2019, the U.S. government indicted the Lamborghini-driving Russian leader of a hacking group calling itself "Evil Corp," and the FBI announced a reward of up  to $5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Maksim Yakubets, 32, of Moscow. It was the largest such offer for a cybercriminal so far. The government said versions of the malware designed by Evil Corp helped criminals install ransomware. At the same time British authorities released a trove of videos and social media postings by Yakubets and other alleged members of Evil Corp doing doughnuts in expensive sports cars on Moscow streets, posing with large amounts of cash and even cuddling up with a pet lion cub. Inevitably, it would seem, at least some American corporate funds are being transferred directly into the cryptocurrency wallets of America's enemies. But here's the good news, at least for American corporate leaders: Bleicher said there is honor among thieves. When companies pay the ransoms, the criminals almost always live up to their end of the deal. In fact, their business model depends on developing a reputation for reliability. If they don't release the data for one victim, the next target may decide not to pay at all. And once they send the cryptocurrency to the bad guys, the hackers move quickly: "Nine times out of 10 you can expect delivery of the decryption key within 24 hours or less." Bleicher's firm Arete has been able to develop striking detail on the ransomware problem across corporate America. For example, they've determined that the RYUK malware extracts the highest fees: an average payment of more than $1.2 million, while the MAZE malware extracts payments averaging over $923,000. Other malware variants lead to payments that are fractions of the most damaging strains. And they see that payment sizes vary dramatically among industries. Health care paid an average ransom of $140,000, while financial firms paid an average of $210,000. But the biggest punch was to the technology, engineering and telecommunications sector, where average payments are over $1 million. With payouts like those it's clear the extortion economy, unfortunately, is booming. Correction: An earlier version misidentified Bleicher's firm's name. It is Arete Incident Response. 
Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., died Tuesday at age 84 after a two-year bout with pancreatic cancer. Democrats now hold a narrower margin in the House, with a 218-211 split, while six vacant seats remain.	Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., died Tuesday after a more than two-year bout with pancreatic cancer, NBC News confirmed. Hastings, who served in the House for nearly three decades, was 84. Throughout his career, he held several key committee assignments and leadership positions, most recently as vice chairman of the rules committee. He had also been Florida's first Black federal trial judge, appointed to the bench in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter. "As an attorney, civil rights activist and judge, and over his nearly thirty years in Congress, he fought tirelessly to create opportunities to lift up working families, communities of color, children and immigrants," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote in a statement. President Joe Biden reacted to Hastings' death on Tuesday afternoon. "Across his long career of public service, Alcee always stood up to fight for equality, and always showed up for the working people he represented," he said in a statement. "Jill and I are saddened to learn of his passing." Democrats now hold a narrower advantage in the House, 218-211, giving the party a smaller margin of error in passing legislation. Six seats are vacant, four of which were previously held by Democrats and two by Republicans. Three of the four Democratic House seats were vacated by appointments to positions in President Joe Biden's Cabinet. Deb Haaland, of New Mexico, was appointed secretary of the Department of Interior ; Marcia Fudge, of Ohio, was named head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development , and Cedric Richmond, of Louisiana, became senior advisor to the president and director of the White House Office of Public Engagement. One of the two vacant GOP seats is no longer up for contest. Julia Letlow of Louisiana was elected in late March but has yet to be sworn in. Julia will replace her late husband, Luke Letlow, who was elected to the seat but died before being sworn in due to Covid-19 complications. In 1983, when Hastings was a federal judge, he was acquitted in criminal court on a charge of conspiring to solicit a bribe in exchange for leniency in a sentencing. Nevertheless, the House impeached Hastings in 1988 amid accusations that he perjured himself during that criminal trial. The Senate voted to convict him , removing him from the bench, but did not vote to disqualify him from holding future office. Hastings appealed the impeachment conviction in 1992. A federal judge overturned the conviction , on the grounds that a 12-member Senate committee, rather than the full Senate, conducted the impeachment trial. This was the first time a Senate conviction was overturned by a federal judge. The next year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled federal courts do not have the authority to review the procedures of a Senate impeachment trial. Hastings' legislative career, which began with his election in 1992 and continued until his death, was unaffected by the decision.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau expects mortgage servicers to offer homeowners options before foreclosing on them. Here's what it means for you.	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is warning mortgage servicers that they're expected to help the surge of struggling homeowners in the pandemic and explore options other than foreclosure. "Responsible servicers should be preparing now," CFPB Acting Director Dave Uejio said in a statement. "There is no time to waste, and no excuse for inaction." When the federal foreclosure moratoriums expire at the end of June , the CFPB says mortgage servicers should brace for a flood of homeowners reaching out for assistance. In particular, the consumer agency says it will pay attention to how well all servicers are working with borrowers and preventing avoidable foreclosures. More from Personal Finance: Taxpayers are leaving $1.3 billion in tax refunds on the table New batch of $1,400 stimulus checks includes 'plus-up' payments CFPB proposes rule to prevent foreclosures until 2022 The bulletin is a welcome turnaround from the Trump administration, said Mitria Wilson-Spotser , director of housing policy at the Consumer Federation of America. "All these policies in the past have applied to federal servicers," Wilson-Spotser said. "The CFPB's announcement is the first attempt to address the private market." Around a third , or 14.5 million, of mortgages in the U.S. are privately owned and not federally backed. In short, it means the CFPB is expecting mortgage servicers to help you stay in your home. What should that assistance look like? For one, your servicer should present you with any possible options other than foreclosure, including forbearances or reduced monthly payments, said Alys Cohen , an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. If you prefer to be told your options in a language other than English, you should be able to request that. If you're deprived of any of these things, experts recommend you submit a complaint with the CFPB. In addition to the consumer agency's guidance, there have been many other relief measures passed for people finding it difficult to pay their mortgage in the pandemic. The Biden administration has announced additional forbearance opportunities for homeowners with federally backed mortgages . Some people can have their payments paused for as long as 18 months. If you expect that your ability to come up with your monthly mortgage payments will remain hampered beyond your forbearance term, you can ask your lender for a payment reduction, Cohen said. Although a lower monthly payment can mean a longer loan term and more interest, the option allows many people to stay in their homes. (If you pursue this route, you'll want to find out how your insurance and tax payments will be impacted.) The most recent stimulus package passed by Congress also includes a $10 billion pot to help homeowners who've fallen behind . This money can be used on your mortgage, homeowner association fees, property taxes or utilities. States still need to set up programs to disburse the funds but, in the meantime, experts recommend that you call local housing groups, your representatives or the local 211/311 lines in your area to learn how to get in line for the money.
The Wharton School estimates that Biden's infrastructure plan would reduce U.S. debt by 6.4% and GDP by 0.8% in 2050 versus current law. The modest reduction in economic growth is thanks to the fact that infrastructure improvements will allow Americans to be more productive, the school said. Wharton estimates that raising the corporate tax rate to 28% would generate an additional $891.6 billion by 2031 and have little impact on business investment in the near term.	The proposed increase to the corporate tax rate in President Joe Biden's landmark infrastructure plan will not lead to a significant reduction in business investment, according to a new study from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Of utmost interest to Wall Street is Biden's plan to hike the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% in what would amount to a partial rollback of former President Donald Trump 's 2017 tax cuts. Wharton estimates that raising the corporate rate to 28% would generate an additional $891.6 billion from 2022 to 2031 and, perhaps surprisingly, have little impact on business investment in the near term. The school explained that's because corporations with significant capital investments may opt to defer a tax incentive known as bonus depreciation to years when the Biden hikes may take effect. Bonus depreciation allows companies to immediately deduct a large chunk of the purchase price of certain assets, like capital equipment, instead of marking its value down over several years. Trump's 2017 tax cuts doubled the bonus depreciation deduction to 100% from 50% for qualified property. "Raising the statutory corporate tax rate is expected to increase corporate investment in the near-term," the Wharton researchers wrote. "Under the current-law regime of accelerated depreciation, marginal effective tax rates on corporate investment are low regardless of the headline rate. As a result, raising the corporate tax rate does not meaningfully affect the normal return on investment, instead taxing rents and returns from existing capital." Neither the White House nor the Treasury Department immediately responded to CNBC's request for comment. Still, Wharton found that the negligible to positive impact of a corporate rate hike would be offset if Congress approves the American Job Plan's minimum tax on book income, which would reduce the value of depreciation deductions. The infrastructure plan marks Biden's first in-depth tax proposal since he took office earlier this year. The mammoth plan is expected to undergo significant changes as it moves through Congress, where Republicans are united in their opposition to the tax increases. Democrats, if they opt to pursue the infrastructure plan via budget reconciliation, will need almost unanimous backing from their caucus to pass it without support from the GOP. But even Democratic support remains in question after Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., made clear earlier this week that he isn't a fan of hiking the corporate rate to 28%. The school's latest research, published Wednesday morning, also found that the administration's American Jobs Plan will generate $2.1 trillion in tax revenues and spend $2.7 trillion between 2021 and 2030. By 2050, the proposed tax increases and repairs to American infrastructure will reduce U.S. debt by 6.4% and GDP by 0.8% in 2050 relative to current law. "Initially, federal debt increases by 1.7 percent by 2031, as new spending in the [American Jobs Plan] outpaces new revenues raised," the researchers wrote. "After the AJP's new spending ends in 2029, however, its tax increases persist—as a result, federal debt ends up 6.4 percent lower by 2050, relative to the current law baseline." The relatively modest reduction in economic growth by 2050 is thanks in large part to the fact that infrastructure improvements will allow Americans to be more productive in the years to come, the school said. Transportation infrastructure repair, for example, can help boost productivity in the long term if U.S. workers spend less time stuck in traffic or commuting around a jeopardized bridge. "Public investments include new spending on transit infrastructure, research and development, and domestic manufacturing supply chains," the researchers wrote. "These are considered investments in 'public capital' which enhance the productivity of private capital and labor." On the revenue side, the Wharton School found that the American Jobs Plan would be funded by a combination increase to the corporate tax rate, a minimum tax on corporate book earnings, an increase to the tax rate on foreign profits and the elimination of tax benefits for fossil fuels.
President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he is willing to negotiate on the proposed corporate tax rate hike in his $2 trillion infrastructure plan. "I'm willing to listen to that," Biden said at the White House when asked if he would consider a lower corporate tax rate than 28%, as his plan currently calls for. The president's remark about the corporate tax rate came after he delivered a sweeping defense of the size and scope of his proposed infrastructure overhaul.	President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he is willing to negotiate on the proposed corporate tax rate hike in his $2 trillion infrastructure plan. "I'm willing to listen to that," Biden said at the White House when asked if he would consider a lower corporate tax rate than 28%, as his plan currently calls for. "We've got to pay for this," Biden added, noting that there are "many other ways we can do it." "But I'm willing to negotiate that," he said. The president's remark about the corporate tax rate came after he delivered a sweeping defense of the size and scope of his proposed infrastructure overhaul. Republicans have been quick to criticize the plan for funding too many projects that, in their view, fall outside the definition of infrastructure. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has tried to brand the plan a "Trojan Horse" for liberal policies, and other GOP lawmakers have claimed that only a small fraction of the massive bill goes toward "real infrastructure." But Biden argued Wednesday afternoon that "the idea of infrastructure has always evolved to meet the aspirations of the American people and their needs. And it is evolving again today." The president said he welcomes debate about the specifics of the bill, and said "any Republican who wants to get this done" is invited to the White House. But he noted that his own view is that infrastructure reform should be crafted with the future in mind, rather than focused on repairing existing structures. "We don't just fix for today. We build for tomorrow," Biden said. "It's not a plan that tinkers around the edges. It's a once-in-a-generation investment in America, unlike anything we've done since we built the interstate highway system and won the Space Race decades ago," the president said. "It's a plan that puts millions of Americans to work to fix what's broken in our country: Tens of thousands of miles of roads and highways, thousands of bridges in desperate need of repair. It's also a blueprint of infrastructure needed for tomorrow," he added. Biden's proposal, dubbed the American Jobs Plan, includes roughly $2 trillion in spending over eight years . The White House offered a 15-year path to funding the plan, in part by hiking the corporate tax rate to 28%. Republicans had slashed the levy to 21% from 35% as part of former President Donald Trump's 2017 tax law. The infrastructure plan would also implement other measures, such as boosting the global minimum tax for multinational corporations and closing so-called offshoring loopholes, for funding. "Building the infrastructure of tomorrow requires major investments today," Biden said. "The divisions of the moment shouldn't stop us from doing the right thing for the future." The ambitious, expensive push to update U.S. infrastructure kicked off just weeks after Biden signed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill into law . That package passed through Congress without any GOP support, and it's likely to be even tougher for the White House to convince Republicans to back another huge bill that also includes tax increases. But Biden also faces pressure from Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has already come out against a 28% corporate rate . In a Senate split 50-50 between the two parties, Manchin's vote could make all the difference.
In letters to leaders at Goldman Sachs, Nomura Holdings America and Credit Suisse, Sen. Sherrod Brown indicated he's looking for details on their relationship to Archegos. CNBC received a letter from Brown to Morgan Stanley after publication of this story. The letters are the first response from Congress that hint at a possible investigation and go beyond initial statements merely condemning the market chaos.	Sen. Sherrod Brown, chairman of the powerful Senate Banking Committee, is taking aim at three banking giants' ties to Archegos Capital after the fund's recent losses blitzed the market. In letters to leaders at Goldman Sachs , Nomura Holding America and Credit Suisse , the Ohio Democrat indicates he's looking for details on their relationship to Archegos. The letters, first reviewed by CNBC, are dated Wednesday. CNBC received a letter from Brown to Morgan Stanley after publication of this story. Archegos, a family investment office run by former Tiger Management analyst Bill Hwang , triggered a sell-off in stocks like Discovery and ViacomCBS last month when it was forced to liquidate its positions in those companies. Several banks were caught in the fallout. Credit Suisse and Nomura were two prime brokers that took significant losses. Two executives at Credit Suisse announced they would be stepping down. Goldman and Morgan Stanley , on the other hand, managed to sell most of the stock related to its Archegos' margin calls and avoided any losses. Brown sent letters to Goldman CEO David Solomon , Crystal Lalime , general counsel of Credit Suisse and Yo Akatsuka , CEO of Nomura Holding America. The letter to Morgan Stanley was addressed to their CEO James Gorman . The letters are the first response from Congress that hint at a possible investigation and go beyond initial statements merely condemning the market chaos, such as the one Brown issued last week. At the time, Brown called on regulators to take a "closer look" at Archegos. The committee has jurisdiction over the world's largest banks and regularly engages with the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC has reportedly opened a preliminary investigation into Hwang and his recent trades . Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is also a member of the Senate Banking Committee, recently told CNBC that "Archegos' meltdown had all the makings of a dangerous situation." Brown's letters to the three banking officials try to delve into the links between the financial institutions and Archegos. "The details and ultimate consequence of Archegos's failure remain to be seen, but the massive transactions, and losses, raise several questions regarding Goldman Sachs's relationship with Archegos and the treatment of so-called 'family offices,' Mr. Hwang's history, and the transactions that have been mentioned in news reports," the letter to Solomon says. Brown goes on to ask the executives to "outline the know your customer (KYC) review and client onboarding process for family offices, including any consideration given to whether the family office is subject to regulatory registration or reporting." On Archegos, Brown asks for "the client onboarding process, including any supervisor or risk committee approvals, for Archegos, identifying when it became a client" along with requests for the banks to "identify the broker-dealer, bank, and other entities, directly or indirectly, involved in transactions with Archegos and that participated in the margin call and resulting stock sales." Brown calls on Goldman, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and Nomura to respond to his letters by April 22.
President Biden said getting Congress to revoke the broad immunity that gun-makers have from being sued over shooting incidents is a top priority for his administration. "Most people don't realize: The only industry in America, billion-dollar industry, that can't be sued, exempt from being sued, are gun manufacturers," Biden said during a White House speech on addressing gun violence. Congress in 2005 passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which gave gun manufacturers a significant degree of immunity from being sued for money damages by victims of gun violence and their relatives.	President Joe Biden said Thursday that getting Congress to end the broad immunity that gun-makers have from being sued for shootings is a top priority for his administration. "Most people don't realize: The only industry in America, billion-dollar industry, that can't be sued, exempt from being sued, are gun manufacturers," Biden said during a White House speech where he announced a series of executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence. "Imagine how different it would be had that same exemption been available to tobacco companies, who knew and lied about the danger they were causing" deaths from cancer, Biden said as he called on Congress to revoke the gun industry's protection from civil liability claims. Biden spoke on the day a gunman killed five people in South Carolina , one of four mass shootings in the U.S. in the past three weeks. The others were in Georgia, Colorado and California. Congress in 2005 passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which gave gun manufacturers a significant degree of immunity from being sued for money damages by victims of gun violence and their relatives. "If I get one thing on my list, Lord came down and said, 'Joe, you get one of these,' give me that one," Biden said. "Because I tell you what, there would be a come-to-the-Lord moment these folks would have, real quickly." White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters later that Biden is calling for lawmakers in Congress to reintroduce past bills that sought to repeal the protection act. A Pennsylvania appeals court last September ruled that the act was unconstitutional. The decision was the first by any court to conclude that the law violated the 10th Amendment. The ruling did not affect the law's application nationwide.
Google urged the Biden administration to join a technology and trade council with the European Union as enforcers abroad pursue more robust regulation of the industry. Karan Bhatia, Google's vice president of government affairs and policy, warned in a blog post Friday that the technology trade relationship between the two governments "is fraying." He urged the Biden administration to join an EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council proposed by the European Commission and to expand it.	Google urged the Biden administration to join a technology and trade council with the European Union as enforcers abroad pursue more robust regulation of the industry. Karan Bhatia, Google's vice president of government affairs and policy, warned in a blog post Friday that the technology trade relationship between the two governments "is fraying." Bhatia said the U.S. policy "has been largely reduced to pressing Europe to follow U.S. supply chain initiatives" while Europe pursues broad regulations, like taxes on digital services. Bhatia said such trends hurt both economies and will make it harder for them to address new global challenges or "partner with emerging economies in Asia." Google's appeal to the White House comes as President Joe Biden has begun staffing his team with well-known critics of the tech industry , including his Federal Trade Commission nominee Lina Khan and National Economic Council advisor Tim Wu . The company faces antitrust lawsuits from several states and the Department of Justice, which began under the previous administration. Still, Google's appeal to the Biden administration may indicate that it sees it as a potential ally for fending off the most impactful legislation from the EU and preventing a splintered version of the internet across continents. The European Commission has shown a greater willingness over the past several years to crack down on the U.S.-based tech companies, waging several competition penalties against Google before the U.S. ever brought an antitrust case against it. Still, the U.S. has recently ramped up enforcement and Biden's recent appointments indicate a continuation of that policy. In the blog post, Bhatia urged the Biden administration to join an EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council proposed by the European Commission and to expand it. In order to be most effective, both sides should consult with one another before taking significant actions that could impact the way the other engages in tech trade negotiations, he said. Bhatia added that this would mean the EU should consult the council about whether regulations like its sweeping Digital Markets Act would "reflect the EU-U.S. values-based alliance." That legislation would authorize major penalties for companies including Google for failing to comply with certain standards to prevent self-preferencing of their own products and services in their markets. Violations could be punished with hefty fines or even divestment of parts of the business. The blog was published ahead of Bhatia's appearance at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Friday. At the event, Bhatia expressed concern over the fragmentation of the internet across countries. "What I am worried about to some extent though is sometimes concerns about security or concerns about sovereignty, which are legitimate concerns, can spill over into what are fundamentally protectionist policies and that yields fragmentation of not just the trading system but the internet writ large," he said. "And I do worry that we are seeing this incredible tool that has generated so much benefit to the world, to the global economy and so forth, look at sort of a breakdown of international norms and with it the services and benefits that it's provided. So we need to be watchful for that. It is a concern and a risk." Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube. WATCH: Big Tech may face even more scrutiny for antitrust and monopoly in 2021—Here's why
Rep. Matt Gaetz has hired two top New York defense lawyers, one of whom represents the Trump Organization in a criminal probe, to represent him as he faces a federal sex trafficking investigation. The retention of the Trump firm's lawyer Marc Mukasey is noteworthy not only for Mukasey's record of handling serious criminal cases but also because Gaetz is among former President Donald Trump's most ardent defenders. The moves came as a lawyer for Gaetz's friend Joel Greenberg indicated Thursday that Greenberg plans to plead guilty in a federal case in which he has been charged with sex trafficking of an underage girl, wire fraud, stalking and trying to bribe a federal official.	Rep. Matt Gaetz has hired two top New York defense lawyers — one of whom currently represents the Trump Organization in an ongoing criminal probe — to represent him as the Florida Republican faces a federal sex trafficking investigation. The retention of the Trump firm's lawyer Marc Mukasey is noteworthy not only for Mukasey's track record of handling serious criminal cases but also because Gaetz is among former President Donald Trump 's most ardent defenders. Mukasey, a former federal prosecutor who is the son of former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, also had been a protege of Trump's personal lawyer former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Joining Mukasey in representing Gaetz in the criminal probe is Isabelle Kirshner. Gaetz, who has not been criminally charged, also has hired a public relations firm, the Washington-based Logan Circle Group, to manage what has been damning media fallout after news of the federal probe first broke last week in The New York Times. The moves came as a lawyer for Gaetz's friend Joel Greenberg indicated Thursday that Greenberg plans to plead guilty in a federal case where he has been charged with sex trafficking of an underage girl, wire fraud, stalking and trying to bribe a federal official. That case against Greenberg, a former Florida county tax collector, led to the ongoing investigation of Gaetz, 38, on suspicion of an illicit sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl . Investigators also are eyeing whether Gaetz paid women to travel to the Bahamas for sex, according to NBC News, as well as whether he and Greenberg used the internet to search for women to be paid for sex. The disclosure that Greenberg expects to reach a plea deal in his own case ignited immediate speculation that he would cooperate with federal authorities as they continue to investigate Gaetz, who has denied any wrongdoing. "I'm sure Matt Gaetz isn't feeling very comfortable today," said Greenberg's lawyer Fritz Scheller on Thursday after he appeared in court in the case. "You've seen the number of stories out there and the emphasis is on their relationship. Isn't it obvious to assume that he would be concerned?" Erin Elmore of Logan Circle Group in a statement Friday said of Gaetz: "Matt has always been a fighter." "A fighter for his constituents, a fighter for the country, and a fighter for the Constitution," Elmore said. "He's going to fight back against the unfounded allegations against him. His legal team, led by Marc Mukasey and Isabelle Kirshner, will take the fight to those trying to smear his name with falsehoods." Elmore is a lawyer who appeared in Season 3 as a contestant on Trump's former television show "The Apprentice." The Logan Circle Group is headed by Harlan Hill, another Trump advocate , who was banned last fall from appearing on the conservative Fox News network after he tweeted that Vice President "Kamala Harris comes off as such an insufferable lying b----. Sorry, it's just true." Mukasey declined to comment to CNBC about his work for Gaetz, pointing to Elmore's statement. A spokesman for Kirshner declined to comment for her other than confirming that she and Mukasey had been retained by Gaetz. Trump has not said much in Gaetz's defense in the past week, other than to deny a story that Gaetz sought a blanket criminal pardon from Trump before the end of his term in January and to point out that Gaetz "has totally denied the accusations against him." Mukasey is one of several lawyers representing Trump's company in a criminal investigation by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who is looking into not only the company but also the former president himself and others connected to the firm. Vance's office is believed to be investigating possible tax and bank fraud by the Trump Organization, as well as whether the company properly accounted for hush-money payments made in 2016 to two women who say they had sex with Trump. The ex-president denies the women's claims and has said Vance's probe is a witch hunt. On Thursday, investigators from Vance's office collected financial records from Jennifer Weisselberg, the former daughter-in-law of the Trump Organization's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. Jennifer Weisselberg has said she is cooperating with Vance's probe. The Washington Post reported that a subpoena issued at Vance's request sought documents in her possession that relate to the Trump Organization and an ice rink the company had run in Central Park, which Weisselberg's ex-husband, Barry Weisselberg, managed. Michael Cohen, who served for years as Trump's personal lawyer, has also cooperated with Vance's investigation. At the same time, New York Attorney General Letitia James is conducting a civil investigation of whether the Trump Organization improperly valued various real estate assets for financial benefits in the form of lower tax liabilities, insurance rates and loan terms. Mukasey is representing the Trump Organization in James' investigation. Kirshner, a former Manhattan assistant district attorney, previously represented former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Trump enemy who resigned in 2018 after The New Yorker magazine published an article detailing claims by four women who said he had "subjected them to nonconsensual physical violence." Schneiderman denied their claims. Kirshner also previously represented Dr. Robert Hadden, a Manhattan gynecologist who was charged by federal prosecutors last September with sexually assaulting multiple patients from 1993 to 2012. Evelyn Yang, whose husband, Andrew Yang, now is running for New York mayor and sought the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, told CNN last year that she was sexually assaulted while seven months pregnant by Hadden during a visit to his office.
Chief executives from companies including Google parent Alphabet, AT&T, Intel and General Motors are set to participate in a White House virtual summit on Monday addressing the global semiconductor shortage. The shortage of computer chips has implications for a range of industries, from producers of electric vehicles to medical supplies. President Joe Biden signed an executive order in February ordering a 100-day review of semiconductors and other key products.	Chief executives from companies including Google parent Alphabet , AT&T , Intel and General Motors are set to participate in a White House virtual summit on Monday addressing the global semiconductor shortage. The summit comes as the Biden administration embarks on a review of key U.S. supply chains , including those for semiconductors, high-capacity batteries, medical supplies and rare earth metals. The shortage of computer chips has implications for a range of industries, from producers of electric vehicles to medical supplies. Automobile manufacturers like GM and Ford recently had to cut production estimates or extend downtime to deal with the shortage. The supply chain was initially compromised early in the Covid pandemic since a large portion of the world's chips are manufactured in Asia, where the crisis first hit. U.S. officials and lawmakers have underscored the potential security implications of the country's reliance on other countries for semiconductors. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in February that "semiconductor manufacturing is a dangerous weak spot in our economy and in our national security." As a matter of both economic and national security, the supply chain assessment outlined by Biden's executive order from February seeks to check the "resiliency and capacity of the American manufacturing supply chains and defense industrial base to support national security [and] emergency preparedness." The White House has also said it seeks to review gaps in domestic manufacturing and supply chains that are dominated by or run through "nations that are or are likely to become unfriendly or unstable." Though the White House's review does not mention China explicitly, the directive is likely in large part an effort by the administration to determine how reliant the U.S. economy and military are on a critical group of Chinese exports. The virtual summit will be hosted by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and NEC Director Brian Deese, joined by Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, according to the White House. Participants will discuss Biden's American Jobs Plan and how to strengthen the U.S. supply chain for semiconductors, according to the White House.

President Joe Biden is seeking an additional $3 billion in Department of Education funding for federal Pell grants, which are for families who demonstrate exceptional financial need. The budget proposal would offer students an extra $400 a year in grant funds. It would be the biggest annual increase since 2009, according to the administration. The request would also make Pell grants available to undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.	President Joe Biden asked Congress for a $400 annual increase in maximum Pell grants for college students as part of a budget proposal issued Friday. The president also called to broaden eligibility to undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. Pell grants are available to undergraduate students who display exceptional financial need. Unlike loans, they generally don't have to be repaid. More from Personal Finance: New college grad job outlook looks promising for Class of 2021 Biden tax plan may lead to more Roth retirement accounts More colleges move to make vaccines mandatory for students If adopted by Congress, Biden's budget would yield the largest one-time annual increase to the federal grants since 2009, according to the proposal, signed by Shalanda Young, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget. Students can currently get a maximum $6,495 grant for the 2021-22 award year, which starts July 1, according to the Department of Education. Amounts vary based on criteria like school cost, full- or part-time status, and information reported on one's FAFSA federal student aid form (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). The Biden administration positioned the increase as a first step toward the president's goal of ultimately doubling grant money available to students. The raise would promote greater racial equity and lower financial barriers for low- and middle-income students seeking a college degree, the administration said. "To help shrink racial gaps in higher education — which have worsened amidst the COVID-19 pandemic — the discretionary request takes a significant first step toward doubling the Pell Grant by proposing to increase the maximum grant by $400," according to the proposal. The budget request applies to discretionary federal spending for fiscal-year 2022, which starts Oct. 1. The proposal would also make Pell grants available to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and are Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients. The DACA program, created during the Obama administration, lets such individuals, known as Dreamers, stay in the country for a period of time that's subject to renewal. However, DACA recipients are not eligible for federal financial aid like grants or loans. Biden's budget would allocate an extra $3 billion to the Department of Education for the measures. Overall, the request includes $102.8 billion for the Education Department, a roughly 41% increase over the amount enacted in 2021.
The House Ethics Committee launched an investigation into Rep. Matt Gaetz, the embattled Florida Republican who is facing a federal sex-trafficking investigation. "The Committee, pursuant to Committee Rule 18(a), has begun an investigation and will gather additional information regarding the allegations," the panel said in a statement. The Democrat-led ethics panel also said it has begun a probe into Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., citing public allegations of possible sexual misconduct by the congressman.	The House Ethics Committee said Friday it launched an investigation into Rep. Matt Gaetz, the embattled Florida Republican who was already facing a federal criminal sex-trafficking probe. In a statement, the ethics committee said it is aware of public allegations that Gaetz "may have engaged in sexual misconduct and/or illicit drug use." The panel also noted that Gaetz is alleged to have "shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift, in violation of House Rules, laws, or other standards of conduct." Gaetz, 38, has vigorously denied wrongdoing since the Department of Justice's investigation first came to light last week. He has not been charged with a crime. "Once again, the office will reiterate, these allegations are blatantly false and have not been validated by a single human being willing to put their name behind them," Gaetz's office told CNBC in response to the new ethics probe. The Democrat-led ethics panel also revealed Friday that it has begun a probe into Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., citing allegations of possible sexual misconduct. Last month, Reed apologized to a woman who accused him of rubbing her back and unhooking her bra at a Minneapolis bar in 2017. Reed said he would not seek reelection in 2022. Reed's office did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment but said in a statement to Politico: "We have already publicly addressed this situation and consistent with that are cooperating with the House Ethics Committee to bring this matter to conclusion." The Ethics Committee's press releases, attributed to Chairman Ted Deutch, D-Fla., and ranking member Jackie Walorski, R-Ind., both noted that an investigation "does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred, or reflect any judgment on behalf of the Committee." Federal investigators are looking into whether Gaetz had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and paid for her travels with him, The New York Times first reported last week . That probe reportedly grew out of an investigation into Gaetz's associate Joel Greenberg, a former county tax collector in Florida who is facing criminal charges including sex trafficking of a minor, stalking, wire fraud and identity theft. Greenberg had previously pleaded not guilty to the charges, but his lawyer and the prosecutors in his case told a judge Thursday that Greenberg is expected to strike a plea deal. NBC reported Wednesday that investigators are looking at whether women were paid to travel to the Bahamas with Gaetz for sex and whether Gaetz and Greenberg used the internet to look up women they could pay for sex. "I'm sure Matt Gaetz is not feeling very comfortable today," Greenberg's attorney Fritz Scheller told reporters Thursday afternoon. One Republican congressman, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, has already called on Gaetz to resign . Gaetz declared this week he is "absolutely not resigning" from Congress. A staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, Gaetz has retained Marc Mukasey, a defense lawyer representing the Trump Organization, to represent him . Gaetz has also hired a public relations firm, Logan Circle Group, amid the torrent of damning news coverage.
A progressive group pushing Congress to raise the corporate tax rate is launching an ad campaign targeting FedEx and Nike, two large American companies with light federal tax bills. Tax March, which held dozens of demonstrations in 2017 calling on former President Donald Trump to release his tax returns, plans to release ads targeting FedEx on Tuesday. Tax March also plans to target Nike with a newspaper ad next week in the shoe giant's home state of Oregon.	A progressive group pushing Congress to raise the corporate tax rate is launching an ad campaign targeting FedEx and Nike, two large American companies with light federal tax bills, the group said Monday. Tax March, which held dozens of demonstrations in 2017 calling on former President Donald Trump to release his tax returns, plans to release ads targeting FedEx on Tuesday. The TV ads will air in Washington, D.C., and in Memphis, Tennessee, where FedEx is headquartered. A report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says FedEx "zeroed out its federal income tax on $1.2 billion of U.S. pretax income in 2020 and received a rebate of $230 million." The report says the lack of payments in taxes by some corporations is likely linked to historic tax breaks as well as Trump's 2017 tax reform plan and certain elements of the coronavirus relief bill known as the CARES Act. Tax March also plans to target Nike with a newspaper ad next week in the shoe giant's home state of Oregon, according to Dana Bye, the campaign director for the group. She said the newspaper ad will have a message similar to that of the TV spot focusing on FedEx. The institute's report said Nike "didn't pay a dime of federal income tax on almost $2.9 billion of U.S. pretax income last year, instead enjoying a $109 million tax rebate." "FedEx pays all U.S. federal, state, and local taxes, totaling over $20 billion between 2016 and 2020. During that time Congress adopted new tax laws to help companies like FedEx make additional investments in its people, providing pay increases and funding pensions, and in local economies, adding new jobs and improving infrastructure. These changes were laws, not loopholes," company spokeswoman Isabel Rollison said in a statement after this story was published. After issuing her initial statement, Rollison later clarified to CNBC saying "FedEx pays all U.S. federal, state, and local taxes, totaling over $9 billion between 2016 and 2020." "FedEx has collected and remitted over $20 billion in taxes in the U.S. (federal, state and local individual income, payroll, customs duties and state & local sales tax) during the last five fiscal years 2016-2020,"she added. A representatives for Nike didn't respond to CNBC's request for comment. President Joe Biden has said he wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% to help pay for his $2 trillion infrastructure reform package. He has since said that he's willing to negotiate on the potential corporate tax hike as moderate Democrats such as Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., have pushed back on raising the rate to 28%. Bye said the campaign as a whole will cost almost $500,000. It will also include digital ads on Facebook and other platforms. The TV ad, first reviewed by CNBC, takes aim at FedEx as one of several companies that paid little to no federal corporate income taxes recently. "Tell Congress: It's time to put the people first," a voiceover on the FedEx ad says. "Make corporations like FedEx pay their fair share." FedEx recently told CNBC that it is against raising corporate taxes as way to pay for Biden's infrastructure plan. Advocacy groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable have also opposed the idea of raising the corporate tax rate as a way to pay for infrastructure. "I think the biggest statement we are trying to make through this campaign is that we can't let corporate tax dodgers like FedEx drive the debate on taxes," Bye said. Tax March is a project of the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a dark money 501(c)(4) organization that contributed just over $60 million to Democratic-aligned groups during the 2020 election, including millions to super PACs backing Biden, according to data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The campaign by Tax March is one of the first to take on corporations since Biden became president. It comes as corporations are under pressure to respond to new voting laws such as those recently passed in Georgia .
Apple has agreed to send a top executive to testify before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust after leading senators pressed the company to make one available to discuss competition concerns about its app store. Subcommittee chair Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and ranking member Mike Lee, R-Utah, wrote a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday about Apple's "refusal to provide a witness to testify in a timely manner." Timothy Powderly, senior director of government affairs for the Americas, responded in a letter Sunday that Apple was "surprised" by the senators' letter, saying Apple had previously said it was willing to participate but sought different dates.	Apple has agreed to send a top executive to testify before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust after leading senators pressed the company to make one available to discuss competition concerns about its app store. In a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday , subcommittee chair Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and ranking member Mike Lee, R-Utah, wrote about Apple's "refusal to provide a witness to testify in a timely manner." They said they "strongly urge Apple to reconsider its position." Apple responded on Sunday in a letter obtained by CNBC and first reported by Bloomberg , agreeing to send Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer to testify on April 21. Timothy Powderly, senior director of government affairs for the Americas, wrote that Apple was "surprised" by the letter from Klobuchar and Lee, saying it had previously expressed a willingness to participate but "simply sought alternative dates in light of upcoming matters that have been scheduled for some time and that touch on similar issues." Klobuchar and Lee wrote on Friday that Apple had previously cited ongoing litigation as a reason for refusing to provide a witness in April. Apple faces a lawsuit from Fortnite maker Epic Games , which has accused the company of violating antitrust laws through its stewardship of its app store. Epic and other developers have long complained of Apple's 15% to 30% fees on purchases customers make through apps on its iOS devices. The senators said that plenty of other executives in the tech sector and beyond have testified under similar conditions, adding that Apple was aware of the litigation when originally working with the subcommittee to provide a witness. They also noted Apple's choice to send witnesses to testify before state legislatures voting on bills that would regulate app stores in the way their panel plans to explore . "Apple's sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee on app store competition issues in April, when the company is clearly willing to discuss them in other public forums, is unacceptable," they wrote in the letter Friday. Powderly told the senators Apple understands their interest in holding the hearing in April and would make Andeer available. Andeer has previously testified before House members and in state legislatures over similar issues. Powderly emphasized the app store's role in helping developers of all sizes to make apps that serve the customer experience. "Customers benefit from our commitment to quality, security, and privacy, and we look forward to the opportunity to share our story," he wrote. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

The NCAA, which regulates college athletics in the U.S., backed transgender athletes Monday, saying it won't hold championship events in locations that aren't "free of discrimination." As Republicans in more than two dozen states target transgender athletes, the NCAA Board of Governors said it "firmly and unequivocally supports the opportunity for transgender student-athletes to compete in college sports." The board said it would monitor situations regarding trans athletes' participation without specifically mentioning states that have banned it or are considering bans.	The NCAA, which regulates college athletics in the U.S., backed transgender athletes Monday, saying it won't hold championship events in locations that aren't "free of discrimination." As Republicans in more than two dozen states target transgender athletes, the NCAA Board of Governors said it "firmly and unequivocally supports the opportunity for transgender student-athletes to compete in college sports." It said its "more inclusive" policy for transgender athletes, which requires testosterone suppression treatment for transgender women to compete in women's sports, means "inclusion and fairness can coexist for all student-athletes, including transgender athletes, at all levels of sport." The board said it would monitor situations regarding trans athletes' participation without specifically mentioning states that have banned it or are considering bans. It did say the "environment" could affect the locations of championship games. "When determining where championships are held, NCAA policy directs that only locations where hosts can commit to providing an environment that is safe, healthy and free of discrimination should be selected," the statement said. "We will continue to closely monitor these situations to determine whether NCAA championships can be conducted in ways that are welcoming and respectful of all participants." Asked whether the statement meant the NCAA wouldn't hold championship games in states that passed laws limiting trans athletes' participation, a spokesperson said, "The Board of Governors continues to monitor the situation and has not made a decision regarding championships." Advocates, many of whom have been calling on sports organizations and businesses to take a stand, said the statement was a welcome development. "Dangerous proposals around the country are putting transgender young people at risk," Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, deputy executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said in a statement. "The harm is real and is felt very personally by transgender kids just trying to live their lives as who they really are. The NCAA is making it clear that their Board of Governors supports transgender athletes, and the board should hold those states passing these harmful laws accountable." Almost 30 states are considering legislation that would ban transgender students from competing on school sports teams that align with their gender identities, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The measures are specifically meant to bar trans girls from participating. Four states — Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas and Idaho — have enacted bans; a federal judge stopped Idaho's law from taking effect in August. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem signed two executive orders limiting trans athletes' participation after she vetoed an earlier bill. Supporters of the bills say transgender girls have an unfair advantage in sports, but trans advocates say lawmakers are creating a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. The Associated Press found that, in almost all states considering bans, the bill's sponsors weren't aware of any cases in which trans girls' participation caused problems. Advocates have been awaiting a statement from the NCAA, which pulled seven championship games out of North Carolina in 2016 after Pat McCrory, then the governor, signed HB 2, also known as the "bathroom bill," requiring transgender people to use the bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificates. Last week, Tom Walton, the son of Walmart founder Sam Walton, also spoke out in response to bills targeting LGBTQ people in Arkansas, including its trans athletes' law, and a law banning transition care, such as puberty blockers, for minors. "We support Gov. Asa Hutchinson's recent veto of discriminatory policy and implore government, business and community leaders to consider the impact of existing and future policy that limits basic freedoms and does not promote inclusiveness in our communities and economy," Walton said in the statement. The Legislature overrode Hutchinson's veto.
IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said the U.S. fails to collect as much as $1 trillion in taxes owed each year, partially due to the explosion of cryptocurrencies. The crypto world "is replicating itself constantly," Rettig said, who cited NFTs as an example. Many NFT buyers are not aware that they have to pay a capital gains tax when they use appreciated crypto to make a purchase.	Tax evasion using cryptocurrencies is "replicating" with nonfungible tokens and other new crypto-related products, according to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig. In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Rettig said Tuesday the U.S. fails to collect as much as $1 trillion in taxes owed each year in part due to the explosion in cryptocurrencies, which are difficult for the agency to track and tax. Rettig said the crypto economy — now valued at over $2 trillion globally — continues to expand, specifically mentioning NFTs, as an example. "So now we have these nonfungible tokens, which are essentially collectibles in the crypto world," Rettig said. "These are not visible items by design. The crypto world is not visible." "In the criminal context, the IRS criminal investigations, cybercrime unit has been spectacular operating in the dark web , engaging with cryptocurrency-related transactions," Rettig added. Answering a question from Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio — who said he is working on a bill to require more reporting and disclosure around crypto transactions — Rettig noted that "absolutely, reporting with respect to cryptocurrencies would be important." Cryptocurrencies are taxed by the IRS as capital assets , not currencies. Thus, holders of the cryptocurrency are required to pay capital gains taxes if they sell their crypto for a profit or use it for a purchase. Tax experts say many crypto holders are either unaware of the requirement or avoiding the tax. Platforms such as Coinbase — which fought an IRS request for customer data in 2016 — now report some customer information to the IRS. But tax experts say clearer government regulation is needed to require more taxpayer disclosure. As a sign of how important crypto tax evasion has become to the IRS, the agency added a question to the top of the Form 1040 — the main income and tax reporting form — asking: "At any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange or otherwise acquire any financial interest in virtual currency?" NFTs have also exploded in value and popularity in recent months, raising a whole new set of tax questions. NFT sales topped $2 billion in the first quarter in the platforms tracked by NonFungible.com. Although NFTs are purchased with crypto — usually ether — many U.S. NFT buyers are not aware they have to pay a capital gains tax when they use appreciated crypto to make a purchase.
Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said he is retiring from Congress at the end of his term. Brady, who was House Ways and Means Committee chairman, took a leading role in pushing former President Trump's sweeping tax-cut bill through Congress in 2017. Brady faced a term limit on his role as the Republican leader of the committee — and said that fact weighed on his decision to retire.	Rep. Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who took a leading role in pushing former President Donald Trump 's sweeping tax-cut bill through Congress in 2017, said Wednesday he is retiring from Congress. "I'm retiring as your congressman," Brady announced in a speech during an economic conference hosted by the Woodlands Area Chamber of Commerce. "This term, my 13th, will be my last." Brady, 66, served as the chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, the top tax-writing body in the chamber, for two terms. He became the ranking Republican on the panel in 2019, after Democrats took majority control of the House. Brady faced a term limit on his role as the Republican leader of the committee — and said that fact weighed on his decision to retire. "Because House Republicans limit committee leadership to six years, I won't be able to chair the Ways and Means Committee in the next session when Republicans win back the majority," Brady said. "Did that factor into the decision? Yeah, some." But Brady said he still sees those limits as a "good thing" because they "ensure lawmakers who work hard and who work eﬀectively someday have the opportunity to lead, to bring fresh new ideas to every committee we have." Brady, anticipating questions from those curious about his motive for retiring, also said he was "absolutely not" leaving Congress because he has "lost faith in a partisan Congress and the political system." "After 25 years in the nation's Capitol I haven't yet seen a problem we can't solve or move past. Not one." He added: "Given the times, I'm sure some will say, 'It's Trump's fault.' Nonsense." Brady's highest-profile moment in Congress came in 2017, when the committee he led took responsibility for crafting the tax-cutting legislation that Trump had promised on the campaign trail and pushed for during his first year in office . The nearly 200-page, $1.5 trillion tax bill slashed taxes for corporations, trimmed rates for individuals and tweaked rules for tax deductions. Trump signed the legislation on Dec. 22, 2017 . Republicans said the tax overhaul would boost hiring and business investment and put more money in Americans' pockets, while Democrats said the changes disproportionately helped corporations and the richest earners. Critics also took aim at the huge burden the bill was projected to add to federal budget deficits. Trump himself said before signing the bill into law that the corporate cuts were "probably the biggest factor" in the plan. More than three years later, the impact of the law remains a heated source of debate . Supporters, especially those in the Trump White House, credited the cuts with creating a strong labor force that was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Detractors say the bill ballooned the deficit to provide a fleeting stimulus. The bill marked Trump's signature legislative achievement during his one term in office. Brady in a statement Wednesday touted the cuts, saying they "lifted millions of Americans out of poverty, and gave hope to so many the old tax code had left behind." "America recaptured the title as the most competitive economy in the world, bringing manufacturing jobs and investment back home to America from overseas," Brady's statement said. Brady, now in his 25th year in Congress, said in the statement, "I'll leave Congress the way I entered it, with the absolute belief that we are a remarkable nation – the greatest in history." "The American Dream is still alive and well for anyone willing to work for it until it's theirs. That is why I remain optimistic about our country, because I have faith in our people," he said. "I've seen up close how remarkable you are, and while I am leaving Congress I am excited about our future."
Chamber of Progress, a new tech industry group funded by giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google is announcing its support for a corporate tax increase like the one President Joe Biden proposed to fund his $2 trillion infrastructure plan. The move sets Chamber of Progress, a new center-left group, apart from other business organizations that have opposed Biden's tax hike, like the Business Roundtable and U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The group's endorsement doesn't reflect the individual views of each company that funds it, but it sends a signal that the tech industry is open to higher tax rates and supports greater infrastructure investment.	Chamber of Progress, a new tech industry group funded by giants like Amazon , Facebook and Google , is announcing its support for a corporate tax increase like the one President Joe Biden proposed to fund his $2 trillion infrastructure plan . The move sets Chamber of Progress , a new center-left group, apart from other business organizations that have opposed Biden's tax hike , like the Business Roundtable and U.S. Chamber of Commerce. While the group's endorsement does not reflect the individual views of each company that funds it, it does send a signal that the tech industry is open to higher tax rates and supports greater infrastructure investment. Chamber of Progress launched late last month and is an industry coalition focused on a range of economic, social and consumer issues, including creating a social safety net and tackling income inequality. Biden proposed raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% to help fund his American Jobs Plan , which includes infrastructure proposals that span the entire economy. The plan includes money to expand broadband availability, which is key to the success of internet businesses, and other priorities the tech industry has emphasized, like clean energy. "The plan speaks to a lot of goals that I think many people in the tech industry have wanted to see for a long time," Adam Kovacevich, founder and CEO of Chamber of Progress, said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. Kovacevich said his group's openness to a higher tax rate isn't a decision based on bottom line calculations. "Certainly all business benefits when there's better infrastructure," he said. "But I really don't think people in the tech industry view it that way. I don't think they're thinking, 'this is great for the bottom line.' Most people in tech think these kind of investments are good for American society and for America's technological leadership in the world, too." Kovacevich said it's possible for the tech industry to take this position because, in his 15 years of experience working for tech companies including Google and Lime, he's noticed that investment decisions don't tend to hinge on the corporate tax rate, but rather on what expansion opportunities are available to pursue. "From my experience in the tech industry, this is a deal that most tech companies can live with," he said of the tax hike. Automattic, Doordash , Getaround, Grubhub , Instacart, Lime, Twitter , Uber , Waymo, Wing and Zillow are also partners that support Chamber of Progress. The group says partners don't sit on its board of directors or vote on its policies. Chamber of Progress didn't identify a specific rate at which it believes corporate taxes should be set, and Biden has indicated openness to negotiating the specifics of his infrastructure plan. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced his support for a tax increase , though he did not endorse the 28% rate outright. Biden previously singled out Amazon for its historically low federal income tax payments, which the company has attributed to tax credits including for research and development. Amazon paid $162 million in federal income taxes in 2019 after two years of paying $0. It reported total revenue last year of $386 billion. Chamber of Progress' decision to support a domestic tax hike comes as the tech industry faces the threat of higher taxation from abroad. In a blog post previewed by CNBC, Kovacevich references efforts in Europe to impose a digital services tax that would impact large U.S. technology companies, calling such proposals "discriminatory." He lauded the Biden administration for pushing back on the moves, writing that the U.S. has a "national interest" in a fair global tax system. "U.S. companies also need to be able to compete fairly against foreign competitors, and that's why Congress should focus on how to fairly tax U.S. companies' foreign revenue," Kovacevich wrote. "Our tax system should also continue encouraging companies to invest in research and development. And Congress should take a close look at how the current cap on state and local tax deductions might threaten the ability of tech companies to attract talent." Kovacevich wrote that he respects businesses that worry the tax increase will have a negative impact, but said serious action needs to take place to upgrade U.S. infrastructure. "President Biden's proposal to raise corporate tax rates to make major investments in infrastructure is a tradeoff that many in the tech industry can support," he wrote. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

House Republicans are gearing up to take aim at the legal shield that protects tech platforms from liability over content moderation, with staff outlining key concepts for legislation in a memo obtained by CNBC on Thursday. The E&C Republican staff wrote that the concepts aim to exclusively target "Big Tech companies with an annual revenue of $1 billion," likely targeting companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook.	House Republicans are gearing up to take aim at the legal shield that protects tech platforms from liability for the content users post. On Thursday, Republican staff for the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a memo suggesting several concepts for reforming Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , a 1996 law that protects tech platforms from liability for users' posts and for their own moderation practices. Those concepts include: Underscoring all of the concepts are three main principles: Protecting free speech, balancing interests of small businesses to protect competition, and promoting American leadership in tech. The memo said proposed legislation would exclusively target "Big Tech companies with an annual revenue of $1 billion," suggesting it will focus on giants like Amazon , Apple , Google and Facebook . The E&C Republican staff sent the memo to the staff of individual Republican members of the committee, as well as other unspecified stakeholders. Republicans generally have criticized Section 230 protections for allowing tech platforms to make allegedly biased decisions about what posts to take down, while Democrats seek to place greater responsibility on platforms to expand their content moderation to make their services safer for users. The memo also dives into more specific suggestions, including the following: Appealing decisions. The memo suggests tech platforms should have a stronger path for users to appeal decisions they feel are unfair. One concept says platforms should be required to maintain a user-friendly appeals process to challenge decisions and tell users why they were made. Carving some companies out entirely. The memo suggests carving Big Tech companies out of Section 230 protections so only smaller businesses and new entrants will maintain the protections, and repealing the shield for companies that use targeted behavioral advertising (the latter of which is similar to a bill Democrats have proposed ). Reauthorization every five years. The staff proposed that Section 230 should be reauthorized every five years for the Big Tech companies, incentivizing them to be careful and allowing for iteration as the industry evolves. Transparency. Another set of principles focuses specifically on transparency around the Big Tech companies' content moderation practices, like requiring them to submit detailed descriptions of their policies to the Federal Trade Commission. Protecting children. The memo also outlines principles to protect children online, a theme that emerged during the committee's last hearing with several tech CEOs in March. Some of the concepts center around holding the companies accountable for content and ads they show to minors, while others require them to track the way their products impact children's mental health. Working with law enforcement. A final set of concepts outlines the ways Big Tech should be required to work with law enforcement. Many already do work with law enforcement and report illicit material, but conflicts have arisen when enforcers have asked for access to encrypted information. Apple, when in this situation, said it could not create a so-called backdoor for law enforcement that wouldn't jeopardiz e the security of all of its users. The memo does not make mention of encryption in particular. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube. WATCH: Section 230 explained
Members of Congress Thursday heard public testimony from the U.S. Capitol Police inspector general the Jan. 6 insurrection. “It's time for Congress to act...They need to get this done, they can't wait for Jesus to come fix this,” said Honoré. “We’ve had two different reports now, both the IG report and Task Force 1-6, saying we need more officers, and that will not start until the supplemental is funded.”	Retired Lt. General Russel Honoré urged Congress to act and pass supplemental funding to finance critical changes to improve the U.S. Capitol Police's emergency response in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection. "This is their police force, this is not something that happens in Afghanistan or Iraq. These are the policemen, two of them have died protecting them. It's time for Congress to act," said Honoré. "They need to get this done, they can't wait for Jesus to come fix this." U.S. Capitol Police Inspector General Michael A. Bolton told lawmakers Thursday that an order barring officers from using their most powerful riot control weapons, like sting balls and 40-mm launchers, compromised the Capitol on Jan. 6. Bolton added that officers were told not to use those weapons because they could've been life threatening, and said that the takeaway is that the officers should have been properly trained to use them. Honoré led a task force to review the U.S. Capitol security in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection, and urged Congress to revamp its security forces by adding 854 more officers and a rapid response unit. Honoré told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith" that the U.S. Capitol is only secure now the National Guard is there to back up the Capitol Police. He also said that, structurally, the U.S. Capitol is not secure as the doors and windows have not been fixed properly, and the engineered fencing has not yet been completed. "The mission of Congress is to fund the police," Honoré said.  "We've had two different reports now, both the IG report and Task Force 1-6, saying we need more officers, and that will not start until the supplemental is funded."
Facebook announced Monday it's expanding a tool that allows users to transfer their data to other services. Facebook will now enable users to transfer a copy of their written posts and notes to Blogger, Google Docs and WordPress. Facebook has advocated for data portability laws and is using Monday's launch to illustrate how firmer guidelines around the process could enable a greater, and more secure, flow of data between services.	Facebook is renewing its calls for Congress to create guidelines about how online services should make users' data available to transfer to other platforms as it expands its own feature to do just that. Facebook announced Monday it's expanding a tool that allows users to transfer their data to other services. Facebook will now enable users to transfer a copy of their posts and notes to Blogger, Google Docs and WordPress. The company already has a way for users to transfer their photos and videos to other services as well. Lawmakers have advocated for so-called data portability functions as a way to level the playing field for newer entrants into the tech industry. Facebook has attracted antitrust scrutiny and is currently facing legal challenges from the Federal Trade Commission and a broad coalition of states for allegedly maintaining monopoly power illegally. Some lawmakers believe that if users could more easily take their data off of Facebook's services, it could incentivize them to leave. This would then open a path for new innovators to grow in the social media space. Facebook itself has advocated for data portability laws, and it is using Monday's launch to illustrate how firmer guidelines around the process could enable a greater, and more secure, flow of data between services. For example, when users transfer their posts and notes through the new feature, those transfers will not include comments from Facebook friends or posts that friends left on a users' page. That's because of the legal ambiguity that exists around who owns that data, especially in the absence of a federal digital privacy law . Facebook already got into trouble for how it granted a third-party developer access to friends' user data without their explicit permission during the Cambridge Analytica scandal . In a white paper published in 2019, Facebook raised questions about whether a platform's "social graph" — or their network of friends a user maintains on the platform — should be portable to other services. While the idea of portability aims for users to take ownership over their data and enable greater competition, it can run into privacy concerns when it's unclear who owns the data or has opted into the transfer. There's also uncertainty around which services should be responsible if data is compromised in the midst of a transfer. Facebook believes this is another place where Congress could clear up confusion. Congress could also set standards for the types of data that services should make available for transfer. They could also set guardrails to prevent certain types of data from being required to be transferred. Some data Facebook collects is done passively or includes inferences the service makes about users, including to protect the integrity of the service. For example, Facebook public policy manager Bijan Madhani said the company will make inferences based on account activity to determine if they are run by bots. He suggested it may benefit users to keep that data out of portability requests in order to maintain the integrity of that feature. Madhani said Facebook plans to continue working on the tool and add destinations for users to transfer their data. He said consumers could look to the data types already available for download to get a sense for what could come next for the transfer tool. Though Facebook previously teamed up with other industry players to create an open source platform that can be used to transfer data between services, Madhani said this is an area that requires government leadership to back up industry standards. "The lack of potential partnership with the government there can leave folks feeling, 'well, OK, whatever we're doing here, when push comes to shove, may not have the actual force of law when actual litigation is on the table,'" he said. "Self regulation is nice but self-regulation without a government regulation backstop is less nice." Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said on Monday that lawyers for property owners who violate the national ban on evictions could face federal prosecution and other consequences. Since the eviction moratorium has been in effect, housing advocates and renters have said a lack of enforcement has led to landlords ignoring the law and pushing out tenants anyway. They hope the new rule puts an end to that.	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced an interim rule on Monday that will allow tenants to sue debt collectors who violate the national ban on evictions. Attorneys for landlords and other debt collectors who wrongly evict tenants could also face federal and state prosecution, the bureau said. In addition, these debt collectors must now provide tenants notice of their rights under the eviction ban in writing and on the same date an eviction notice is served. "No one should be evicted from their home without understanding their rights, and we will hold accountable those debt collectors who move forward with illegal evictions," said Dave Uejio, the CFPB's acting director, in a statement. The announcement is a sign that the Biden administration plans to more aggressively enforce the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's national ban on evictions first issued by the Trump administration in September. More from Personal Finance: Lawmakers step up to improve access to college aid College can cost as much as $70,000 a year Under Biden, free college could become a reality With coronavirus cases and unemployment rates still high, President Joe Biden has since extended the moratorium through the end of June. Research has shown that evictions lead to significantly more coronavirus cases and deaths in an area. Housing advocates point out that the law has failed to protect many tenants because there haven't been enough consequences for violating it. There's no national database of evictions. But since the CDC ban went into effect, Jim Baker, executive director of the Private Equity Stakeholder Project , has counted more than 57,000 new eviction cases filed by corporate landlords in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, Tennessee and Texas alone. During the same period, The Eviction Lab at Princeton University has identified more than 218,000 evictions in the five states and 19 cities that it tracks. "We're still seeing mass evictions, even with the CDC order," Daniel Rose, an organizer with Housing Justice Now in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, told CNBC in December. Evicting tenants is a last resort, Bob Pinnegar , president of the National Apartment Association, told CNBC earlier this year. However, the last year has driven landlords to the brink, he said. "Over 50% of the nation's rental housing providers are mom-and-pop owners, who rely on their few units as their only source of income," he said. "Reserves are running out, and in many cases are exhausted." Still, the consumer bureau made clear on Monday that any property owners' lawyers or other debt collectors who evict tenants illegally or without informing them of the CDC ban could face prosecution by federal agencies and state attorneys general, as well as private lawsuits by individuals negatively impacted. "The rule directly addresses many of the problems that undermined the moratorium, including lack of tenant knowledge about rights, abusive practices and minimal to no enforcement," said Emily Benfer , an eviction expert and a visiting professor of law at Wake Forest University. The bureau also shared information on where renters and landlords can find organizations to apply for the billions of dollars in rental aid passed in the latest stimulus packages.
Top House Democrats are investigating whether Emergent Biosolutions, which recently botched 15 million doses of Covid vaccine, won the federal contract to make the shots based on its cozy relationship with a top former Trump administration official. Emergent received $628 million from the Department of Health and Human Services in June to establish the primary U.S. manufacturing facility for J&J's and AstraZeneca's Covid vaccines. The committees are specifically looking at the role Dr. Robert Kadlec, a former consultant to Emergent and HHS official under Trump, played in helping the company win the contract. The lawmakers also said they are looking at Emergent's role as the nation's sole provider of anthrax vaccine in the Strategic National Stockpile.	Top House Democrats have launched an investigation into whether Emergent Biosolutions , which recently botched 15 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine, won the federal contract to make the shots based on its cozy relationship with a top former Trump administration official. Reps. Carolyn B. Maloney, of New York, chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, and James E. Clyburn, of South Carolina, chairman of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, sent a joint letter to Emergent Solutions' CEO, Robert G. Kramer, and executive chairman, Fuad El-Hibri, to request that they testify before the coronavirus subcommittee. "Specifically, we are investigating reports that Emergent received multi-million-dollar contracts to manufacture coronavirus vaccines despite a long, documented history of inadequately trained staff and quality control issues," the lawmakers wrote. The committees are specifically looking at the role Dr. Robert Kadlec, a former consultant to Emergent and Trump's assistant secretary for preparedness and response, played in helping the company win the contract. They asked the company to turn over a slew of documents, including all of its federal contracts since 2015, all communication with Kadlec as well as information on audits and inspections of its facilities, drug pricing and executive compensation, among other things. "Emergent received $628 million in June 2020 to establish the primary U.S. facility for manufacturing vaccines developed by Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca," the lawmakers wrote in a letter sent Monday to Kramer and El-Hibri. Kadlec "appears to have pushed for this award despite indications that Emergent did not have the ability to reliably fulfill the contract." According to the letter, an FDA inspection of the Baltimore plant in April 2020 revealed that Emergent did not have the necessary personnel to produce a coronavirus vaccine. Another inspection, in June, found that Emergent's plan for producing desperately needed coronavirus vaccines was inadequate due to poorly trained staff and quality control problems. Despite Emergent falling short on federal inspections, the Trump administration paid $628 million to the company in June to manufacture coronavirus vaccines. Reports later emerged that indicated quality control issues at Emergent's Baltimore plant. "During the manufacturing process, your company contaminated millions of doses of Johnson & Johnson's one-shot coronavirus vaccine with ingredients from the AstraZeneca vaccine," the lawmakers wrote. Emergent was forced to destroy up to 15 million tainted doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and another 62 million doses remained in limbo until it could be determined that they were not affected by the mix-up, they said, citing reporting by The New York Times. Emergent's Baltimore plant wasn't approved by the Food and Drug Administration, so none of the doses produced at that site were ever distributed or made their way into Americans' arms. "We are concerned by the costs to taxpayers and the potential impact on our nation's vaccination efforts caused by Emergent's failed attempts to manufacture these vaccines," the lawmakers wrote. The lawmakers also said they are looking at Emergent's role as the nation's sole provider of anthrax vaccine in the Strategic National Stockpile. "Emergent has raised the government purchasing price of the anthrax vaccine by 800% since acquiring the drug in 1998. As a result, through most of the last decade, nearly half of the SNS's budget has been spent purchasing Emergent's anthrax vaccine," the representatives wrote. According to the letter, after Kadlec was confirmed in the Trump administration, Emergent received millions of dollars in federal contracts from his agency, including contracts for the stockpile "that were awarded without competitive bidding." Emergent encouraged oversight of the stockpile to be transferred from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response, under Kadlec's control, according to the letter. Until 2015, Kadlec provided consulting services to Emergent through his company, RPK Consulting. Kadlec was confirmed to lead the office, which is within the Department of Health and Human Services, in 2017. Kramer and El-Hibri were asked to testify before the subcommittee on May 19 at 10:30 a.m. ET.
A Senate Commerce Committee hearing Tuesday revealed several areas of common ground among the group of four sitting members of the Federal Trade Commissioners, who are evenly split along party lines. The group generally agreed that Congress should grant more resources to the agency and reinforce its ability to provide consumers with monetary relief should the Supreme Court roll back that authority with an anticipated ruling. They also largely agreed that the FTC should act to protect consumers' digital privacy should Congress fail to move forward a national law shielding those rights.	A Senate Commerce Committee hearing Tuesday revealed several areas of common ground among the four sitting members of the Federal Trade Commission, who are evenly split along party lines. The agency is awaiting the confirmation of a fifth commissioner to fill out its slate -- the confirmation hearing for President Joe Biden's nominee Lina Khan will take place Wednesday -- but it's clear there are several areas in which the FTC does not need a tiebreaking vote. Commissioners generally agreed that: Lawmakers have spent years grappling with the question of how to protect consumers' digital privacy rights , but so far, there's still no federal law on the books. Meanwhile, some states have moved forward with their own measures, creating a complicated landscape for businesses. The commissioners generally agreed that the best solution is for Congress to enact a digital privacy law quickly, but if it doesn't, the FTC could attempt to fill in some of the gaps. Republican Commissioner Christine Wilson said the FTC has authority under Section 18 of the FTC Act, known as the Magnuson-Moss rulemaking, to provide guidelines around consumer digital privacy. "Granted, a Mag-Moss rulemaking is not the optimal solution, but in the absence of congressional action and in the face continuing harm including growing infringement of our civil liberties, I support Acting Chairwoman Slaughter in considering this path," Wilson said. While a cumbersome process, Wilson said, "inaction is not an option." Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra, who is Biden's nominee to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said there's no harm in the FTC moving forward with rulemaking around data security, even if Congress passes a law in the midst of the process. The commissioners urged lawmakers to reaffirm the FTC's authority to provide monetary relief to consumers when they are harmed by unfair business practices, should the Supreme Court limit their authority to do so. The court is currently considering arguments in a case that could result in limiting the FTC's Section 13(b) authority to grant monetary relief to consumers in such cases. Acting Chairwoman Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a Democrat, said that the uncertainty created by the case has already hindered the FTC's ability to enforce the law. "Even while the Supreme Court case is pending, the uncertainty around 13(b) is affecting our work and affecting our cases," she said. "It's making it harder for us to get that redress to consumers. It's outright barred in some circuits. And other defendants are just saying let's wait and see, we don't want to negotiate, we don't want to get into these conversations, making it harder for us to stop illegal conduct and making it harder for us to make your constituents whole when they have been harmed." Republican Commissioner Noah Phillips said he sought a more limited view of monetary relief for consumers, but generally agreed there should be some ability to grant restitution to consumers harmed by unfair business practices. If the court rules unfavorably toward the FTC's powers, he said, a congressional fix should focus on "helping consumers, not on inappropriately punishing businesses." Another theme of the hearing was about the need for greater resources at the FTC to pursue strong enforcement. During the coronavirus pandemic , Slaughter said, the commission did see a brief dip in merger filings, but they've since returned to record levels. She said March saw the second-highest number of merger filings in a month at more than 300, following November's record over more than 400 filings. Even with a growing workload, the FTC has not been able to hire on more help. Slaughter said employment at the agency has remained flat while merger filings are at about double the level as they were 10 years ago. "The absence of resources means that our enforcement decisions are harder," she said. "If we think that we have a real case, a real law violation in front of us, but a settlement on the table that is maybe OK but doesn't get the job done, we have to make difficult decisions about whether it's worth spending a lot of taxpayer dollars to go sue the companies who are going to come in with many, many law firms worth of attorneys and expensive economic experts, versus taking that settlement."

Those who sign are pledging not to accept donations from companies that violate the signers' convictions about "the free market and the free exchange of ideas." The move is at least partially symbolic, given that several of the firms have already paused donations from their political action committees after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.	The top Republican on the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is leading six of his peers in swearing off campaign donations from Amazon , Apple , Facebook , Google and Twitter . Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., the subcommittee's ranking member, announced Wednesday the " Pledge for America ," urging his peers to follow his earlier commitment to refuse Big Tech money. Those who sign are pledging not to accept donations from companies that violate the signers' convictions about "the free market and the free exchange of ideas." "The threat posed by these monopolies is a real and present danger to conservatives, libertarians and anyone who does not agree with these corporations' ultra-liberal points-of-view," the pledge says. Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, Greg Steube, R-Fla., Dan Bishop, R-N.C., Ralph Norman, R-S.C., Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and Burgess Owens, R-Utah, all signed the pledge. The move is at least partially symbolic, given that several of the firms have already paused donations from their political action committees , as companies from other industries also opted to do, after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Amazon and Google both paused contributions from their PACs to members who voted against certification of the election results affirming President Joe Biden's victory. That would include several of the signatories: Biggs, Bishop, Norman, Owens and Steube. Facebook has paused all donations from its PAC. Apple does not have a PAC, and Twitter closed its PAC in November after it lay dormant for years. The pledge bans donations not only from the companies and their PACs but also from executives who work for them. It's the latest signal that conservatives are serious about cracking down on what they see as unfair treatment by the tech platforms, including allegedly censoring their viewpoints and monopolizing internet markets. Buck has been a close ally of antitrust subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I. Though the two have differed slightly in the extent of the remedies they believe are necessary to reinvigorate competition into digital markets, they have remained closely aligned on the root of the harms by the platforms through the subcommittee's investigation of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Both have expressed a commitment to working on a bipartisan basis to introduce new laws to reform antitrust enforcement. The companies named in the pledge declined to comment or did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

App makers who rely on mobile distribution from Apple and Google complained of the platforms' gatekeeper power, which has allowed them to maintain a strong grip over their businesses. The hearing brought together representatives from Apple and Google as well as several of their most outspoken critics: Tinder owner Match Group, Tile and Spotify. Match Group's chief legal officer accused Google of calling to threaten the company the day before.	Some app makers who rely on mobile distribution from Apple and Google are scared of how much power the tech giants have over their businesses, according to congressional testimony delivered Wednesday. "We're all afraid," Match Group Chief Legal Officer Jared Sine told Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., the chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, at a hearing. The hearing brought together representatives from Apple and Google and several of their most outspoken critics, including Match Group , which owns dating site Tinder; Tile, which makes devices that help users find lost objects and faces new competition from Apple's AirTag technology , and streaming music service Spotify . The hearing comes as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are working on updates to the antitrust laws that could better account for the power a few tech giants hold over many digital markets. That includes the ability of platforms such as Apple and Google to manage the main distribution platform for apps while increasingly hawking their own competing products. Throughout the hearing, the app makers expressed fear over how easily either company could undercut their businesses by making small changes to their app store rules. They also complained of high fees for in-app purchases and unclear enforcement of standards. Multiple executives accused Apple and Google of threatening their businesses. Sine said Google called Match Group on Tuesday night after his testimony became public to ask why his testimony differed from the company's comments in their latest earnings call. On the earnings call, Match executives had said they believed they were having productive conversations about Google's 30% in-app payment fee through its Google Play store. But in testimony, Match complained that Google had made "false pretenses of an open platform" and complained about its "monopoly power." Wilson White, Google's senior director of public policy and government relations, said it sounded like employees working in Google's business development team reached out to ask an "honest question." White said he didn't view it as a threat "and we would never threaten our partners" because Google needs app developers to use its app store in order for it to be successful. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the call was "potentially actionable." Klobuchar said she planned to look into the matter further. Spotify Chief Legal Officer Horacio Gutierrez said he could think of "at least four clear examples of threats and retaliation" from Apple after Spotify decided to speak out about alleged anticompetitive behavior and Apple's fees for developers on digital products purchased through its platform. That included threats of removing Spotify's app, refusing to promote it, or waiting for months for minor app updates to be approved, he said. "They've basically thrown the book at us in order to make it hard for us to continue to sustain our decision to speak up," he said. Many app makers have complained about the fees gatekeepers charge for in-app purchases for digital services. Gutierrez complained of what he called Apple's "gag order" over how Spotify can communicate with its own users about how to upgrade to its paid version. For instance, Spotify allows customers to upgrade only outside of its iOS app in order to avoid Apple's 15% to 30% commission fee on digital services purchased through its platform. But because Spotify doesn't sell the paid service through its iOS app, Apple also doesn't let the app maker talk about upgrades with customers through the app — instead, users have to upgrade through a web browser on a PC or another method. At the same time, Apple operates a competing service, Apple Music, which has no such restrictions. Gutierrez said this gives Apple's version an unfair advantage. Representatives from Apple and Google both told lawmakers that their fees for developers are meant to cover the costs that go into distributing apps through their platforms and securing them appropriately. Apple Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer compared the services offered on the App Store today to the cumbersome and expensive process app makers had to pursue to distribute their apps before the App Store existed. White cast the group as a set of "small but vocal" representatives of "primarily large companies." He said he worried that in trying to satisfy their complaints, "we damage the very foundation that has allowed the Android open source ecosystem to work so well for a much larger set of small and medium-sized businesses." In addition to complaints about fees, developers worried that Apple's own rival products incentivized it to make unfavorable decisions toward them. For example, Tile General Counsel Kirsten Daru said the company had asked Apple for permission to use ultra-wideband technology on iPhones to make its item-tracking technology more precise than it can be using only Bluetooth. She said Apple had refused the request, then reserved the technology for its own competitive AirTags , which it announced Tuesday. While Apple is rolling out a way for third-party developers to build on the more precise location data, Daru said that in order to access that, "we have to give Apple unprecedented control over our business and direct customers to the Find My app to find their lost items." Apple's Andeer argued AirTags is a separate product from Tile, which currently has the majority of the market share for the space, and that opening tools to more third-party developers will encourage competition. App makers also complained that Apple's enforcement of its app store rules can appear arbitrary and delay the launch of key features. Apple may tell developers which rule they've violated but not exactly how or what to do to fix it, Sine said. He said Tinder had tried to submit a version of its app with a feature aimed at protecting its LGBTQ+ users by notifying them when they were in a country where they could be at risk of exposing their sexuality or gender identity. Sine said that it took two months and a conversation between top executives of Match Group's owner, IAC , and Apple to sort out the issue. An exchange between subcommittee ranking member Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Andeer revealed how complex Apple's App Store rules can be. Lee asked Andeer to differentiate between why a paid service through Tinder might incur a commission while one for Uber would not. Andeer explained an Uber customer is paying for a non-digital service — a car to show up to their house — while they don't expect the same return from Tinder, saying that would be a different service, in what appeared to be an insinuation of sex work. The app makers emphasized their reliance on the app stores because of their unprecedented access to consumers. But, they argued, it's not the symbiotic relationship that Apple and Google like to paint. "We are not successful because of what Apple has done, we have been successful despite Apple's interference," Gutierrez said. "And we would have been much more successful but for their anticompetitive behavior." WATCH: Here's why some experts are calling for a breakup of Big Tech after the House antitrust report
The Supreme Court issued a ruling Thursday that will significantly limit the Federal Trade Commission's ability to extract monetary relief for consumers when companies are found to use deceptive practices. The decision will significantly hamper the FTC's ability to return money to consumers duped by deceptive business practices, as the four sitting commissioners testified to Congress on Tuesday. Facebook, for example, argued in its motion to dismiss the FTC's ongoing antitrust lawsuit that it lacks statutory authority under the section of the law targeted in Thursday's ruling.	The Supreme Court issued a ruling Thursday that will significantly limit the Federal Trade Commission's ability to extract monetary relief for consumers when companies are found to use deceptive practices. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Stephen Breyer, the court said that Section 13(b) of the FTC Act does not authorize the agency to seek monetary relief for violations of the law, as it has commonly been used. The court noted that 13(b) doesn't explicitly authorize the agency to obtain such a remedy, but instead allows the FTC to seek "a permanent injunction" pending administrative proceedings. "It is highly unlikely that Congress, without mentioning the matter, would grant the Commission authority to circumvent its traditional §5 administrative proceedings," Breyer wrote. Given that Congress later enacted a law that authorizes the agency to seek monetary relief, the court said it did not believe Congress would have done so if 13(b) already granted that authority. The decision will significantly hamper the FTC's ability to return money to consumers duped by deceptive business practices, as the four sitting commissioners testified to Congress on Tuesday . The two Democrats and two Republicans all advocated for a legislative fix should the Supreme Court rule against its authority to grant monetary relief under Section 13(b), though Republican Commissioner Noah Phillips suggested a more narrow approach focused on restitution rather than additional repayment for ill-gotten gains. The House Energy and Commerce Committee had already slated a hearing for next week to discuss legislative fixes to reaffirm the FTC's power to provide redress to consumers. The ruling could have far-reaching impacts in cases where the FTC has invoked Section 13(b). Facebook , for example, argued in its motion to dismiss the FTC's ongoing antitrust lawsuit that it lacks statutory authority under 13(b). While the issue isn't directly about monetary relief, Facebook argued the FTC should not be able to claim authority under that law to remedy past conduct, since it only allows the FTC to stop ongoing or imminent legal violations. A spokesperson for the FTC declined to comment on how the ruling could impact that case. But the agency's two Democratic commissioners slammed the ruling in statements on Thursday. "In AMG Capital, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of scam artists and dishonest corporations, leaving average Americans to pay for illegal behavior," Acting Chairwoman Rebecca Kelly Slaughter said in a statement Thursday. "With this ruling, the Court has deprived the FTC of the strongest tool we had to help consumers when they need it most. We urge Congress to act swiftly to restore and strengthen the powers of the agency so we can make wronged consumers whole." Slaughter said the agency has used the law to grant billions of dollars in relief for consumers over the past four decades, and it has been particularly useful in taking action against scams related to the Covid pandemic . Fellow Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra suggested the agency deploy a different authority that he said could be used to sanction bad actors. The case at hand involved a payday loan scheme, for which the court ruled in favor of the FTC, ordering the defendant to pay $1.3 billion in monetary relief. The defendant argued that the FTC lacked the authority to seek such a remedy, ultimately leading to Thursday's decision. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google-owned YouTube testified before Congress Tuesday about the ways their algorithms influence users and sometimes serve harmful misinformation. The hearing before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on privacy and technology highlighted a key feature of the social media platforms that has amplified some of the most serious harms lawmakers have been seeking to address through a wide swath of bills. While Section 230 reforms were brought up a handful of times at Tuesday's hearing, the discussion also called attention to what could perhaps be a more narrow way of reining in some of the most pervasive harms of internet platforms by focusing on transparency around their algorithms.	Executives from Facebook , Twitter and Google -owned YouTube testified before Congress on Tuesday about the ways their algorithms influence users and sometimes serve harmful misinformation. The hearing before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on privacy and technology highlighted a key feature of the social media platforms that has amplified some of the most serious harms lawmakers have been seeking to address through a wide swath of bills. Algorithms are essentially the formula social media platforms use to decide what information to surface to people using an app or website. While both Facebook and Twitter have introduced more choice for users around whether they want to view a curated timeline of content on their feeds or not, algorithms can be a useful way to surface the most engaging content for any given user, based on their interests and past activity. While that can work to provide a better user experience, it can also drive users to more polarizing content that reinforces their beliefs, rather than showing them content that challenges their viewpoints. Lawmakers have expressed concerns that algorithms can be used to drive users toward extremism or surface inaccurate information, especially about the coronavirus and vaccines. One of the most frequent targets of lawmaker criticism when it comes to platform regulation has been Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , the shield that protects the platforms from being held liable for their users' posts. While Section 230 reforms were brought up a handful of times at Tuesday's hearing, the discussion also called attention to what could perhaps be a more narrow way of reining in some of the most pervasive harms of internet platforms by focusing on transparency around their algorithms. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., the ranking member on the subcommittee, noted at the end of the hearing that he is still skeptical of such proposals, even though members on both sides of the aisle have promoted them. He raised concerns about the First Amendment implications that reforming the shield could have. "I think in particular some of the conversations about Section 230 have been well off-point to the actual topic at hand today," he said. "And I think much of the zeal to regulate is driven by short-term partisan agendas." Focusing on algorithms could potentially create a more immediately viable path toward regulation. Lawmakers at the hearing seemed to generally be in favor of seeing greater transparency from the platforms about how their algorithms surface content to users. Policy executives from the three companies generally rebutted the idea that their platforms are incentivized to create as much engagement as possible regardless of potential drawbacks. For example, Monika Bickert, vice president of content policy at Facebook, said that when the platform decided in 2018 to surface more posts from friends rather than publishers, it anticipated a drop in engagement, which ultimately occurred. But, she said, Facebook determined the move was still in its long-term interest of keeping users invested in the platform. Senators on the subcommittee remained skeptical that the platforms were not mainly incentivized by ramping up user engagement. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., for example said the platforms themselves are designed to create addiction. Two experts on the witness panel testified that incentives driving amplification of misinformation do in fact exist. Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, testified that he believes the early business model about driving engagement at Facebook still exists and that sitting the executives down to talk about what they're doing to fix the problem is "almost like having the heads of Exxon , BP and Shell , asking about what are you doing to responsibly stop climate change?" "Their business model is to create a society that is addicted, outraged, polarized, performative and disinformed," Harris said. "While they can try to skim the major harm off the top and do what they can — and we want to celebrate that, we really do — it's just fundamentally, they're trapped in something that they can't change." Joan Donovan, research director of Harvard's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, said that "misinformation at scale is a feature, not a bug" for the online platforms. She said that the way social media platforms repeat and reinforce messages to users can "lead someone down the rabbit hole" of an internet subculture. Both experts emphasized that decisions over social media amplification will have profound impacts on democracy itself. Throughout the hearing, senators noted the role social media platforms played in allowing people to organize around events like the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. To close the hearing, subcommittee Chairman Chris Coons, D-Del., said he looks forward to working with Sasse on bipartisan solutions, which could take the form of either voluntary reforms or regulation. "None of us wants to live in a society that as a price of remaining open and free is hopelessly politically divided," Coons said. "But I also am conscious of the fact that we don't want to needlessly constrain some of the most innovative, fastest-growing businesses in the West. Striking that balance is going to require more conversation." Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube. WATCH: The big, messy business of content moderation on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube
The two top senators on the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust sent a letter to Google on Tuesday asking about an alleged call to Tinder-maker Match Group the day before its top lawyer was set to testify about treatment on the Google Play app store. In the letter, subcommittee Chair Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and ranking member Mike Lee, R-Utah, asked for details of the alleged call, including the names of those on the call and what they said. "We are deeply troubled by Match Group's claims that Google may have attempted to influence another witness's testimony," they wrote.	The two top senators on the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust sent a letter to Google Tuesday asking about an alleged call to Tinder-maker Match Group the day before its top lawyer was set to testify about treatment on the Google Play app store. Match's chief legal officer, Jared Sine, told senators during last week's hearing that employees at Google called Match after Sine's opening testimony became public. Sine said they asked why his testimony differed from Match's comments on its last earnings call, where executives said they believed they were having productive conversations about Google's 30% fee for in-app payments through its app store. In the testimony, Sine complained Google had made "false pretenses of an open platform." Asked about the call at the hearing, Google's senior director of public policy and government relations, Wilson White, said it seemed like Google's business development team reached out to ask an "honest question." He added that he didn't view the question as a threat and that Google relies on app developers using its app store to be successful. In the letter addressed to White, subcommittee Chair Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and ranking member Mike Lee, R-Utah, asked for details of the alleged call, including the names of those on the call and what they said. "We are deeply troubled by Match Group's claims that Google may have attempted to influence another witness's testimony," they wrote. "Any efforts to retaliate against those who speak up about public policy issues or possible legal violations are unacceptable, especially by dominant companies that have the power to destroy the business of a whistle-blower." As they plan further hearings on competition matters, the senators wrote, "Witness intimidation in any form will not be tolerated." "Match is a valued partner and we regularly communicate with them about the business we do together," a Google spokesperson told CNBC in response to a request for comment on the senators' letter. "We did not and would not try to influence their testimony, intimidate them or otherwise retaliate." Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

President Joe Biden wants to guarantee workers 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. They could get up to $4,000 a month while they're off, with at least two-thirds of their average weekly wages replaced.	It would be one of the largest expansions to the U.S. social safety net in decades — a new federal paid leave policy for all workers. That's what President Joe Biden is expected to propose on Wednesday night when he rolls out his $1.8 trillion spending and tax credits plan to remake the country's economy after a devastating year. The national paid family and medical leave program would cost around $225 billion over a decade, and the White House says it would be mostly paid for by upping taxes on the wealthy. Within 10 years, Biden's plan would guarantee workers 12 weeks of paid leave, which they could use "to bond with a new child, care for a seriously ill loved one, deal with a loved one's military deployment, find safety from sexual assault, stalking, or domestic violence, heal from their own serious illness or take time to deal with the death of a loved one," according to an outline released by the White House.

The lowest-wage workers would get 80% of their prior earnings. Biden's plan would also give workers three days of bereavement leave per year, starting in year one. Grief has been a major theme of Biden's presidency, with him speaking often about losing his son Beau to brain cancer at 46. The president is also calling on Congress to pass a bill that would require employers to give workers seven paid sick days a year. Currently, companies with 50 or more employees are required to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off, thanks to The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 . But the U.S. is one of the only countries that doesn't guarantee workers paid time off when they're having a new child or dealing with an illness. In Japan and Norway, new parents get more than a year's worth of paid leave . Why is the U.S. different than other countries? "We have historically had low taxes and a skimpy safety net," Brookings Institution senior fellow Isabel Sawhill said. For the same reason — opposition by businesses — the U.S. doesn't have universal health care, City University of New York sociologist professor and labor expert Ruth Milkman said. "They are allergic to any government intervention in the labor market," Milkman said. The vast majority of American voters — around 80% — support the idea of a national paid leave program. But while Americans want access to paid family and medical leave, "a government program isn't the solution," according to The Heritage Foundation research fellow Rachel Greszler . "Most would much rather receive flexible and accommodating policies through their employers than to have to deal with government bureaucrats and the constraints of a one-size-fits-all government program," Greszler said. In the absence of a federal paid leave policy, some states — including California, New Jersey and Rhode Island — have instituted their own programs to compensate workers who take time off. But with most workers at the mercy of their employer's policy, fewer than one in five have access to paid family or parental leave. Meanwhile, fewer than half are offered paid medical leave. The access is even rarer among people of color and low-income workers. "Too many people have been forced to make an impossible choice between the income they need and the families they love because they have no paid leave," said Ruth Martin , senior vice president at nonprofit advocacy group MomsRising. "It's become an even more devastating problem during the pandemic, which has sickened millions, pushed hospitalizations to unprecedented levels and forced even more people to take time off to care for relatives with Covid-19," Martin said. By one estimate , the typical working age adult loses more than $9,500 after taking 12 weeks off without pay. A national paid leave program would likely be financed by payroll taxes, similarly to how the unemployment system is funded, said Sawhill of the Brookings Institution. As it designs its policy, the federal government should take lessons from the states that offer paid leave, Widener University professor Linda Houser said. "One of the many intriguing elements about the state paid leave laws is how they are paid for," Houser said. "Most of them are funded primarily through employee premiums. "In some cases, both employees and employers contribute," she added. "As with other social insurance programs in the United States and elsewhere, the idea is that everyone pays in." Another feature of the state programs that the federal government should study is how they've found a way to include the growing ranks of freelancers, gig-workers and self-employed people, Milkman said. "It's quite inexpensive, so self-employed and gig workers opt-in by just paying the tax, just as some do with Social Security," Milkman said. "In these programs, it's an insurance model. "If you pay the tax, you can make a claim if a covered event, like a new baby, occurs." While certain paid leave policies have the support of Republicans , they oppose Biden's plan to raise taxes to fund the program. That could make passage of such legislation difficult, though Democrats could also use the budget reconciliation process to institute paid leave. That avenue allows them to pass legislation with a simple majority, which is all they have. Other bills typically must garner 60 votes to advance, thanks to Senate procedural rules. The next budget reconciliation process will likely be in the fall. "Paid leave certainly has budget implications so it can go through the reconciliation process," Martin said.

Europe has taken the lead on tech regulation for several years, but the U.S. finally seems to be closer to catching up. The European Commission announced Friday a preliminary finding that Apple had abused its dominant market position in the distribution of music streaming apps. Apple isn't currently facing antitrust charges from government officials in the U.S., but it still faces risks on several domestic fronts.	For a long time, the European Commission seemed to stand apart from the U.S. in cracking down on tech giants with antitrust fines against Google and privacy rules like the General Data Protection Regulation. But when EU competition policy chief Margrethe Vestager announced Friday a preliminary finding that Apple has abused its dominant power in the distribution of streaming music apps, the U.S. finally seemed poised to move in a similar direction. "The Commission's argument on Spotify's behalf is the opposite of fair competition," Apple said in a statement following Vestager's announcement, referring to the music streaming company that raised the competition complaint. Apple said Spotify wants "all the benefits of the App Store but don't think they should have to pay anything for that," by choosing to object to its 15-30% commission on in-app payments for streaming apps. Apple isn't currently facing any antitrust charges from government officials in the U.S. and such a lawsuit may never materialize, though the Justice Department was reportedly granted oversight of the company's competitive practices in 2019 . But even if the government declines to press charges, recent actions in Congress, state legislatures and in private lawsuits demonstrate a significant shift in the American public's sentiment toward Apple and the tech industry at large. When the commission slapped its first record competition fine against Google in 2017, it wasn't yet clear that the U.S. might be ready to move on from its once-cozy relationship with its booming tech industry. But in 2018 — on the heels of the revelations of how Facebook user data was used by analytics company Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 election, and increasing questions about how tech platforms can impact American democracy — that seemed to change. Now, as Europe continues to move forward with its probe into Apple, the U.S. no longer seems to be so far behind. Here's where Apple stands to face risk of antitrust action or regulation in the U.S.: The DOJ has already moved forward with a massive lawsuit against Google, so it could take some time if it decides to ramp up a probe into Apple. Though the DOJ's Antitrust Division took on oversight authority of Apple in a 2019 agreement with the FTC, according to a Wall Street Journal report , the Google investigation has seemed to take priority. Still, then-Attorney General Bill Barr announced later that year that the DOJ would conduct a broad antitrust review of Big Tech companies . Any action from the DOJ or state enforcers would take the form of a settlement or lawsuit, which would put Apple's fate in the hands of the courts. Apple's most immediate challenge in the U.S. has come from private companies bringing antitrust charges against its business in court. The most notable of these lawsuits is from Fortnite-maker Epic Games , which is set to begin its trial on Monday. Epic filed its lawsuit with a PR blitz after challenging Apple's in-app payment fee by advertising in its app an alternative, cheaper way to buy character outfits from Epic directly, violating Apple's rules. That prompted Apple to remove Fortnite from its App Store. Epic filed the suit shortly after and Apple filed counterclaims against Epic for allegedly breaching its contract. "Although Epic portrays itself as a modern corporate Robin Hood, in reality it is a multi-billion dollar enterprise that simply wants to pay nothing for the tremendous value it derives from the App Store," Apple said in a filing with the District Court for the Northern District of California in September. Just last week, several app-makers testified before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust about the alleged anti-competitive harms they've faced from restrictions on both Apple and Google's app stores. Representatives from Apple and Google told lawmakers they simply charge for the technology and the work they put into running the app stores, which have significantly lowered distribution costs for app developers over the years. But witnesses from Tinder-owner Match Group , item-tracking device-maker Tile and Spotify painted a different picture. "We're all afraid," Match Group chief legal officer Jared Sine testified of the platforms' broad power over their businesses. The witnesses discussed the seemingly arbitrary nature by which Apple allegedly enforces its App Store rules. Spotify's legal chief claimed Apple has threatened retaliation on numerous occasions and Tile's top lawyer said Apple denied access to a key feature that would improve their object-tracking product , before utilizing it for Apple's own rival gadget, called AirTag . Tile said that while Apple now makes the feature available for third-party developers to incorporate, accessing it would mean handing over a significant amount of data and control to Apple. Apple's representative said its product is different from Tile's and opening the feature in question will encourage further competition in the space. Senators at the hearing seemed receptive to the app developers' complaints, which build on earlier claims made before House lawmakers. The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust found in a more than year-long probe that Amazon , Apple, Facebook and Google all hold monopoly power , and lawmakers are currently crafting bills to enable stronger antitrust enforcement of digital markets. Several state legislatures have been considering bills that would require platforms like Apple and Google to allow app-makers to use their own payment processing systems . While the bills have so far had varying degrees of success in the early stages of lawmaking, passage in one state could raise a host of questions about how it should be enforced given the ambiguous nature of digital borders. The bills have been supported by the Coalition for App Fairness, a group of companies that have complained about app store fees, including Epic Games, Match Group and Spotify. Apple has often argued that it maintains features like payments within its own ecosystem in order to protect consumers and secure their data, though app developers and lawmakers have expressed skepticism about that reasoning.

Women, people of color and older Americans are among the groups paying the biggest price for the country's $1.7 trillion outstanding student loan balance. As a result, they would be the biggest winners if President Joe Biden decides to cancel some or all of their loans.	Outstanding student loan debt in the U.S. has climbed to $1.7 trillion, a balance that is not evenly distributed among college graduates. Certain groups are far more burdened than others. President Joe Biden is now considering whether or not to reduce or eliminate those burdens by forgiving student debt. Here's who would benefit the most should the president move ahead. Women would be among the biggest winners of student loan forgiveness. That's because around two-thirds of the country's outstanding balance is carried by women. White women student loan borrowers owe an average of $31,300, compared with $29,900 for White male borrowers. Meanwhile, Black women borrowers owe an average of $37,600, versus $35,700 for Black male borrowers. Black and Latino Americans have also been disproportionately burdened by student debt, and therefore stand to be greatly helped by student loan forgiveness. Nearly 85% of Black college graduates carry student debt, compared with 69% of their White counterparts, according to the Center for Responsible Lending . More from Personal Finance: The Covid recovery still has a K shape The problems with virtual evictions How to boost your credit score And around 38% of Black students who entered college in 2004 had defaulted on their student loans within 12 years — a rate three times higher than that of their White peers. As a result, an aide to Sen. Elizabeth Warren , Democrat from Massachusetts, said canceling student debt would make the biggest strides toward closing the racial wealth gap since the Civil Rights movement. A growing number of Americans are bringing student loans into their golden years. And the payments pose a problem for many of them. About 33% of student loan borrowers over the age of 65 are in default, and half of those older than 75 have fallen behind, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. The government can garnish a portion of a borrower's Social Security check if they're in default. "To the extent that they rely on Social Security to pay for basic needs, it is unethical for the federal government to give with one hand and take back with the other," said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Advocates say that forgiving student debt is a crucial part of any meaningful response to the coronavirus pandemic , pointing out that borrowers were already struggling prior to the crisis. Indeed, even before more than a year of record job losses and when the country was in the midst of its longest economic expansion in history, more than 1 in 4 student loan borrowers were in delinquency or default . Around 90% of federal student loan borrowers have accepted the government's offer to put their monthly payments on pause during the pandemic. In a Pew survey, 6 in 10 borrowers said it would be difficult for them to resume their payments in the near future. It's also many of the borrowers most burdened by student debt, including older Americans and women, who've suffered much of the financial fallout of the public health crisis. "Debt cancellation would have a tremendous impact on those most impacted by the coronavirus pandemic," said Alexis Goldstein, a senior policy analyst at Americans for Financial Reform.
Attorneys general from 44 states and territories urged Facebook to abandon its plans to create an Instagram service for kids under the age of 13, citing detrimental health effects of social media on children and Facebook's reportedly checkered past of protecting children on its platform. Monday's letter follows questioning from federal lawmakers who have also expressed concern over social media's impact on children. Facebook committed to not show ads "in any Instagram experience we develop for people under the age of 13," a spokesperson said in a statement.	Attorneys general from 44 states and territories urged Facebook to abandon its plans to create an Instagram service for kids under the age of 13, citing detrimental health effects of social media on kids and Facebook's reportedly checkered past of protecting children on its platform. Monday's letter follows questioning from federal lawmakers who have also expressed concern over social media's impact on children. The topic was a major theme that emerged from lawmakers at a House hearing in March with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Republican staff for that committee later highlighted online protection for kids as the main principle lawmakers should consider in their legislation . BuzzFeed News reported in March that Facebook had been exploring creating an Instagram service for children, based on internal documents it obtained. Protecting children from harm online appears to be one of the rare motivators both Democrats and Republicans can agree on, which puts additional pressure on any company creating an online service for kids. In Monday's letter to Zuckerberg, the bipartisan group of AGs cited news reports and research findings that social media and Instagram, in particular, had a negative effect on kids' mental well-being, including lower self-esteem and suicidal ideation. The attorneys general also said young kids "are not equipped to handle the range of challenges that come with having an Instagram account." Those challenges include online privacy, the permanence of internet posts, and navigating what's appropriate to view and share. They noted that Facebook and Instagram had reported 20 million child sexual abuse images in 2020. Officials also based their skepticism on Facebook's history with products aimed at children, saying it "has a record of failing to protect the safety and privacy of children on its platform, despite claims that its products have strict privacy controls." Citing news reports from 2019, the AGs said that Facebook's Messenger Kids app for children between 6 and 12 years old "contained a significant design flaw that allowed children to circumvent restrictions on online interactions and join group chats with strangers that were not previously approved by the children's parents." They also referenced a recently reported "mistake" in Instagram's algorithm that served diet-related content to users with eating disorders. "It appears that Facebook is not responding to a need, but instead creating one, as this platform appeals primarily to children who otherwise do not or would not have an Instagram account," the AGs wrote. "In short, an Instagram platform for young children is harmful for myriad reasons. The attorneys general urge Facebook to abandon its plans to launch this new platform." In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said the company has "just started exploring a version of Instagram for kids," and committed to not show ads "in any Instagram experience we develop for people under the age of 13." "We agree that any experience we develop must prioritize their safety and privacy, and we will consult with experts in child development, child safety and mental health, and privacy advocates to inform it. We also look forward to working with legislators and regulators, including the nation's attorneys general," the spokesperson said. After publication, Facebook sent an updated statement acknowledging that since children are already using the internet, "We want to improve this situation by delivering experiences that give parents visibility and control over what their kids are doing. We are developing these experiences in consultation with experts in child development, child safety and mental health, and privacy advocates." Facebook isn't the only social media platform that's created services for children. Google -owned YouTube has a kids service, for example, though with any internet service, there are usually ways for children to lie about their age to access the main site. In 2019, YouTube reached a $170 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission and New York attorney general over claims it illegally earned money from collecting the personal information of kids without parental consent, allegedly violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Following the settlement, YouTube said in a blog post it will limit data collection on videos aimed at children, regardless of the age of the user actually watching. It also said it will stop serving personalized ads on child-focused content and disable comments and notifications on them. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

The April jobs report is fueling concern among Republicans and business groups over a $300 weekly supplement to unemployment benefits. They say it's causing a labor shortage by encouraging workers to stay home. However, it's likely not the primary culprit, economists say. Child care, online learning, the pace of vaccinations and early retirements are among other factors.	Tensions are flaring over a $300 supplement to weekly unemployment benefits. A weaker-than-expected April jobs report has led to outcry in some circles that the payments are fueling a labor shortage. The extra aid offers an incentive for laid-off workers to stay home, critics contend, making it hard for businesses to hire. Others think factors like child care and the coronavirus play a primary role in hiring difficulties — not the $300 payments. It's also likely a short-term blip that reflects growing pains in a rapidly expanding economy, they claim. But the truth is likely somewhere is the middle, according to economists. Swift change and unique pandemic dynamics make it impossible to pinpoint to extent to which the $300 boost may be holding back jobseekers, they said. "It's complicated," according to Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. "The biggest mistake one can make is to try to judge the current situation through the lens of past recessions or ideology," she said. "This time is truly different." However, the issue has indeed broken out along political fault lines. Republicans and business groups like the Chamber of Commerce tend to favor abolishing the extra benefits and Democrats tend to favor keeping them. Last week, three Republican-led states (Arkansas, Montana and South Carolina) announced they will cut off the enhanced aid months ahead of schedule . More are expected to follow. More from Personal Finance: There's one week left to contribute to 2020 IRAs Americans fear highest inflation in nearly a decade The pandemic drove these Americans into early retirement The move would end all pandemic-era benefits for self-employed and gig workers and the long-term unemployed, in addition to the $300 a week, at the end of June. The American Rescue Plan offered those benefits through Labor Day. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy added 266,000 jobs in April — weaker than the 1 million expected. "It's getting much harder to hire than in the recent past, by the sheer acceleration of job creation," according to Ioana Marinescu, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania. "We have no commensurate acceleration in people looking for jobs." "It's easy to jump to the conclusion: 'Oh, it's the benefits,'" added Marinescu, who's studied job applications during the pandemic. "Based on past evidence, they may play a role, but they may not be the only thing. "It's a nuanced picture." The controversy is a sort of deja vu from last summer, when Republican lawmakers were against extending a $600 weekly CARES Act supplement that ended in July. That stipend replaced 100% of lost wages for the average laid-off worker. But it paid many people — largely the lowest earners — more than their prior paychecks. Research indicated there wasn't a large job-finding disincentive from the extra $600 a week. The same may be true with the $300 supplement (which replaces 74% of pre-layoff wages , on average) due to return-to-work hurdles, economists said. They include lack of access to child care, continued online or hybrid in-person schooling, and a dearth of after-school programs critical to enabling low-income parents (mostly mothers) to work, Swonk said. Vaccines also weren't widely available until recently, and workers need two to six weeks for full efficacy of the regimen — meaning many can't safely return to work until June, she added. Many baby boomers opted to retire (for fear of contagion or otherwise) and it's unclear how many may return once fully vaccinated, she said. States generally also require people to actively look for work as a condition of receiving unemployment benefits. States suspended the rule early in the pandemic, but many have reinstated it — meaning recipients already need to look for work to continue receiving aid. Workers also can't refuse a suitable job offer and continue to collect unemployment benefits, except in a few Covid-related circumstances, President Joe Biden said in a press briefing Monday. "We'll insist the law is followed with respect to benefits. But we're not going to turn our backs on our fellow Americans," he said. More time and labor market data are needed to make an accurate assessment of the $300, according to Peter Ganong, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of Chicago, who's studied the relationship between unemployment benefits and work disincentives during the pandemic. "The labor market is undergoing a massive readjustment right now," Ganong said on Twitter. "Let's wait for data rather than making policy based on anecdotes." It's also challenging to make national policy prescriptions for something that varies region by region. In Montana, for example, the labor market appears to be close to pre-Covid status, unlike the rest of the U.S., Ganong said . (Montana is one of the states opting to end access to enhanced benefits.) The $300 benefits also help stimulate the economy, Marinescu said. Taking them away at a national level may lead to less household spending — potentially reducing demand for business' goods and undercutting the need to hire more workers. "It's not a black-and-white picture," Marinescu said. "Everyone is experiencing some period of adjustment." "At some point, [the $300] is going to result in a shortfall in employment," she added. But it's hard to know when that is."
Unemployed Americans thought they'd receive benefits until September. Now that aid is in jeopardy in a growing number of states, with Republicans saying it's causing a labor shortage. Others say cutting the benefits prematurely will only make it harder for people to get back on their feet, and that meaningful solutions include higher wages and more affordable child-care options.	While Justin Mackey worked to rebuild his locksmith business, the 38-year-old was relying on getting a $420-a-week unemployment check for another four months. That money was a fraction of what he brought home before the coronavirus pandemic shut down his business in Arkansas, but at least it kept his mortgage and other bills paid. And it allowed him to buy clothes and school supplies for his three young children: Camdyn, 14, Connor, 7, and Charlie, 3. "It's better than losing everything," Mackey said. But last week, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said the state would be ending the federal unemployment programs early, including the $300 weekly boost. Those benefits will now expire at the end of June, more than two months earlier than Mackey had expected.

You may trigger another tax The Fed keeps rates near zero — here's how you can benefit "Continuing these programs until the planned expiration date of Sept. 4, 2021, is not necessary and actually interferes with the ability of employers to fill over 40,000 job vacancies in Arkansas," Hutchinson wrote in a letter . He joins Republican governors in Montana , South Carolina and Mississippi , who have also announced an early end to the aid, saying that it's stopping people from taking jobs. Other states could follow. As a result, many jobless people in these states will soon receive only their state benefit. The average weekly check is $248 in Arkansas; in Mississippi, it's $195 . Rebecca Dixon , executive director of the National Employment Law Project, said leaving people with smaller benefits is shortsighted and dangerous. "We're going to see family hardship," Dixon said. "We're looking at a tsunami of debt, evictions and food insecurity on the horizon, and it's mostly women and people of color who will bear the brunt of that." What's more, because the federal programs expanded the pool of workers who are eligible for unemployment benefits, many self-employed, gig workers and freelancers will be entirely cut off from aid come July. Mackey is one such worker. His unemployment benefits have allowed him to keep his locksmith business, Jonesboro Lock & Key, running. He's owned it for more than a decade. But if that aid ends early, he might have to grab a job and abandon the shop. He said the wages on offer in his area were often unsustainable. "I couldn't afford to work in a fast-food place," Mackey said. "I was making that money in high school." (The minimum wage in Arkansas is $11.) Before the public health crisis, he earned around $2,000 a week. He and his family lived comfortably. And Mackey's business is just starting to improve, he said, with more people calling of late. "One of the reasons this pandemic unemployment is important for now is because it's helping people with small businesses like myself try and build back," he said. The movement to end the federal unemployment programs took off after April job's report showed that the U.S. economy added 266,000 jobs, compared with the 1 million expected. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is among the voices calling on states to end the $300 federal boost, saying that "paying people not to work is dampening what should be a stronger jobs market." The lobbying group also estimates that 1 in 4 jobless individuals are earning more with unemployment than they were when working. Yet cutting the aid will only make it harder for people to get back on their feet, said Megan Dishong , an attorney at the Montana Legal Services Association. Instead of looking for jobs, people will be worried about getting evicted and forced to spend their time applying for additional government assistance such as food stamps and rental aid, she said. "People are in such a bind," she said. "Ending the $300 benefit is only going to tie the knot tighter." If the goal is to get people back to work, she said, the focus needs to be on increasing wages and access to child care. (Among President Joe Biden 's proposals is a plan to make child care affordable or free for many families .) "Until you have a safe, affordable place to send your kid, you just can't go to work," Dishong said. Meanwhile, some of the barriers to returning to work are unique to the pandemic, she said. Some of her clients, for example, are dealing with the long-term symptoms of Covid. "They want to go back to work, but they're still suffering," she said. As the number of states announcing an early end to unemployment benefits grows, Julianne O'Brien fears Florida will be next. She was laid off at the start of the pandemic from her job as an estimator for a manufacturing company and was recently diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. Without the federal aid, she would be left with just $275 a week. She lives around 40 minutes north of Palm Beach with her two children. "People are saying we're lazy and collecting unemployment," O'Brien, 46, said. "I'm just trying to survive." Taking a job is not an option for her right now. "My doctors say I should mostly stay home because my immune system is low," she said. "Covid is still out there." Ashley Broshious said the $300 federal unemployment boost has been a lifeline for her during the pandemic, helping her to start a restaurant consulting and career coaching business. In the past, she's worked as a wine director and a general manager at different restaurants and earned more than $65,000. Those same positions are now offering $40,000, or less, an income that wouldn't allow her to pay all her bills. She's been receiving jobless benefits since April 2020 when she was laid off from a restaurant in South Carolina, one of the states to announce an early end to the aid. (She recently stopped receiving her unemployment checks, but is working with a nonprofit lawyer to get them resumed.) "There's people like me who need that money to start something new, and if we lose it, all those plans end," Broshious, 33, said. It's not just foiled plans that she fears. "If these benefits get cut and I don't win this case, I'll lose my home," she said. "I'm going to have to pack up my car and move in with my mom in her tiny house in Toledo, Ohio."

The nomination of tech critic Lina Khan to the Federal Trade Commission will move to a full Senate vote after a committee voted Wednesday to report the nomination favorably. Four members of the Senate Commerce Committee voted against the measure, all Republicans: Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Mike Lee of Utah, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Dan Sullivan of Alaska. The committee's top Republican, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, voiced optimism about Khan's nomination ahead of Wednesday's vote.	The nomination of tech critic Lina Khan to the Federal Trade Commission will move to a full Senate vote after a committee voted Wednesday to report the nomination favorably. Four members of the Senate Commerce Committee voted against the measure, all Republicans: Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Mike Lee of Utah, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Dan Sullivan of Alaska. Blackburn and Lee in particular had previously expressed skepticism about Khan's nomination, pointing to what they said was a lack of experience. At 32, Khan would be the youngest commissioner to serve, if confirmed. But the committee's top Republican, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, voiced optimism about Khan's nomination ahead of Wednesday's vote. "I believe she is focused on addressing one of the most pressing issues of the day: reining in the big social media platforms," he said. "However, I do remain concerned that a broadly over-regulatory approach as an FTC commissioner could have a negative effect on the economy and undermine free market principles." Khan made her name in antitrust circles after publishing "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox" in the Yale Law Journal while she was a student in 2017. The article examined the ways that the commonly used consumer welfare standard, often defined by looking at whether prices go up or down, could miss important anticompetitive behavior in digital markets like the one in which Amazon operates. Khan later helped investigate and compiled a major antitrust report examining digital markets and specifically Amazon , Apple , Facebook and Google for the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. The report by Democratic staff found each company had maintained monopoly power and suggested sweeping proposals for reinvigorating competition in the market, including through major legal revisions and potential break-ups of companies. Khan's vocal criticism of the Big Tech companies has seemed to gain her allies on the right who could help her secure the role of FTC commissioner. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, a staunch conservative and one of the party's most adamant tech critics, had told Khan at her nomination hearing that he looks forward to working with her. If Khan is confirmed, President Joe Biden will still need to nominate another commissioner or chair to the FTC to fill out the agency's five seats. He has nominated current Democratic commissioner Rohit Chopra to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and has not yet named a permanent chair after naming Democrat Rebecca Kelly Slaughter acting chair.

With news that inflation is speeding up faster than it has in more than a decade, investors are on edge. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 681.50 points, or 2%, on Wednesday, and the S&P 500 fell 2.1%. Here's why the headlines shouldn't make you do anything rash.	With news that inflation is speeding up faster than it has in more than a decade , investors are on edge. That's because when the cost of living goes up, investment returns also need to go higher for people to maintain the same buying power. But they don't always do that. As a result, investors are left with less. "The risk is that if inflation heats up that that could gobble up everything you're earning," Christine Benz, director of personal finance at Morningstar, recently said . Stocks are already reflecting investors' concerns , as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 681.50 points, or 2%, on Wednesday, and the S&P 500 fell 2.1%. More from Personal Finance: Californians could see new stimulus checks, renter assistance Memorial Day travel to soar 60% even as gas nears $3 a gallon Hundreds of colleges say Covid vaccines will be mandatory for fall 2021 While inflation can be a real risk for investors, it's too soon to panic, said certified financial planner Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York. "Anyone who believes they can see into the future is kidding themselves," Boneparth said. Signs of what's to come are mixed, he said. For example, prices rose quickly in April , but the jobs report for the month was majorly underwhelming . The latter suggests the economy may not be heating up as much as some believe. "It's early to make changes," he said. Despite the recent drops, the market has been good to investors over the last year. From January 2020 to the beginning of this month, the S&P 500 has had an annual return of more than 20%, according to Morningstar Direct. A $10,000 investment would have grown to more than $13,000. And although inflation can eat away at market returns, the damage isn't as bad you may think. Between 1900 and 2017, the average annual return on stocks has been around 11%, according to calculations by Steve Hanke , a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. After adjusting for inflation, that average annual return is still 8%. Generally, financial advisors caution against making big changes to your investment strategy based off headlines or any one event. "For longer-term investors, we suggest staying the course if they can," said Rob Williams, vice president of financial planning at Charles Schwab. Doing so pays off. Over the last 20 or so years, the S&P 500 produced an average annual return of around 6%. But if you missed the best 20 days in the market over that time span because you became convinced you should sell, and then reinvested later, your return would shrivel to 0.1%. Bouts of market volatility, as uncomfortable as they can be, should be expected, said Allan Roth , founder of financial advisory firm Wealth Logic in Colorado Springs, Colorado. "Pain is a sign you're investing well," Roth said.
A ninth batch of federal stimulus checks has been sent, bringing the total number of payments to about 165 million, worth $388 billion. This round included nearly 1 million payments totaling more than $1.8 billion. Most of the checks were triggered by newly processed federal tax returns.	A new batch of $1,400 stimulus checks has been issued to Americans, bringing the total number of payments sent to about 165 million, or $388 billion. This marks the ninth set of payments since the $1,400 stimulus checks were authorized by Congress in March. The checks are for up to $1,400 per adult, based on certain income thresholds and other requirements, as well as $1,400 per dependent. More from Personal Finance: Is a $300 unemployment boost holding back jobs? Yes and no Getting these Social Security questions wrong could cost you There's one week left to contribute to 2020 IRAs The new batch included more than 960,000 payments representing more than $1.8 billion. About 500,000 of those payments were made via direct deposit, while the rest were via paper check. The payments included about 460,000 "plus-up" payments worth more than $800 million to people who were due additional money once the IRS processed their 2020 tax returns. It also included more than 500,000 checks, representing more than $1 billion, to people who the IRS did not previously have on record, and who recently filed tax returns. If you have not received your $1,400 stimulus check — or the previous two $1,200 or $600 checks — you can still claim the money by filing a federal tax return. This year, the filing deadline has been extended to Monday, May 17. However, those who choose to pursue an extension until Oct. 15 will still be able to claim the money, the IRS has confirmed . (But keep in mind you will not be able to put off paying anything you owe without potential fees or interest.) If you have not filed a tax return in the past two years, doing so now can help the IRS process your stimulus check, so long as you are eligible for it. Your 2020 tax return will also show whether your income dropped since you last filed in 2019, or if you have added a dependent, which could make you eligible for additional funds. The IRS continues to issue checks each week, including "plus-up" payments to those people whose previous checks fell short. A section for the recovery rebate credit – line 30 of Forms 1040 or 1040-SR and a worksheet – has also been added to this year's return to help people claim any missing money from the first $1,200 or second $600 federal stimulus checks. People who do not normally file tax returns, including the homeless and rural poor, are encouraged to do so this year in order to get their stimulus checks. Filing a tax return will also help the IRS assess whether you may be eligible for additional funds through the earned income or child tax credits. Filers who are below certain income thresholds may be eligible for free tax preparation services provided through the IRS. 
Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Steve Daines wrote the FTC to ask the agency to address a rise in travel and tourism scams. "It is critical to ensure that Americans understand how to recognize travel scams and their recourse options should they fall victim to these scams," the senators said in a letter. The FTC says consumers have lost over $400 million to fraudsters since the pandemic began.	Two U.S. senators called on the Federal Trade Commission in a letter Thursday to do more to protect American consumers from travel scams. Responding to reports of increased fraud in travel and tourism — such as scammers posing as travel advisors or creating fake airline websites to sell counterfeit tickets — Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Steve Daines, R-Mont., asked FTC acting Chair Rebecca Slaughter to disclose any actions it has taken to address the issue and explain how it plans to prevent such crimes.

How travelers could benefit from hotel industry struggles What to expect as live music events take to the stage again "While the FTC posts advisories pertaining to travel scams, we believe that more must be done to protect consumers," the senators wrote. "Travel reservations made on fraudulent websites can be costly and stressful for travelers, and it is critical to ensure that Americans understand how to recognize travel scams and their recourse options should they fall victim to these scams." Klobuchar and Daines note in their letter that as vaccination rates pick up and restrictions are lifted nationwide, some 67% of Americans say they're planning to travel this summer. In addition, they cite a recent FTC report that found consumers overall have lost more than $400 million to fraudsters since the pandemic began more than a year ago. Klobuchar, a co-chair of the Senate Travel and Tourism Caucus, has been active in advocating for U.S. travelers. In March, she and the three other caucus members wrote Commerce Department Secretary Gina Raimondo asking what steps the department was taking to help the travel and tourism industry recover from the pandemic and to promote the "Brand USA" public-private marketing partnership. In February, Klobuchar and Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., introduced the Protecting Tourism in the United States Act "to improve tourism across the country by studying the effects of the pandemic on the travel and tourism industry and identifying key policy recommendations," according to her office.
For rideshare companies like Lyft and Uber, the slow emergence from the pandemic brings hope that their services will hum back to life as customers resume travel. But there are still challenges ahead for gig-economy companies operating in the rideshare and food delivery spaces. One was signaled by Uber’s recent decision in the U.K. to reclassify its drivers as employees after the supreme court there handed down an unfavorable ruling.	Things seem to be looking up for rideshare companies Lyft and Uber as people prepare to resume travel, but new worries may be around the corner. That's because while these companies may enjoy pent-up demand for travel and a political win in California that reaffirmed their gig work model, firms that rely on a fleet of independent contractors face global challenges to the way they operate. For starters, there's Uber's recent decision in the U.K. to reclassify its drivers as  entitled to some benefits, though not full employee status, after the supreme court there handed down an unfavorable ruling. As workers in Britain, these drivers are entitled to minimum wages, holiday pay and retirement benefits. "I think everyone was watching the U.K.," said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. "There's a lot of fear that now this is going to spread to France, to Germany, to Scandinavia. And ultimately that can really crimp a lot of that gig economy if other countries follow it." Generally, by classifying workers as independent contractors, the firms avoid the expense of maintaining employees. This year, Uber has 5 million drivers around the world, according to the ridesharing giant. Meanwhile, Lyft said in 2019 that it had 2 million drivers on its platform. While fighting to maintain the independent contractor model in California, both firms said they would have to retreat or scale back jobs if they were forced to claim drivers as employees.
The interest rates on federal student loans will rise by nearly 1% starting in July, according to estimations by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Here's what else borrowers need to know.	The interest rate on new federal student loans is going up. The government sets annual interest rates on the debt once a year, and the percentage is based on the 10-year Treasury note . Despite the uptick, rates remain low by historical standards, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Although the U.S. Department of Education hasn't formally announced the new rates for the 2021-2022 academic year, Kantrowitz has calculated what the new figures will likely be. By Kantrowitz' estimations, the interest rate on federal student loans will climb by 0.98%. "It is the fourth-lowest interest rate in the last decade," he said. More from Personal Finance: Is $300 unemployment boost holding back jobs? Yes and no Americans fear highest inflation in nearly a decade Before you buy dogecoin, consider these 3 things And due to the pandemic, the interest rate on most federal student loans has been set to zero through September. Here's what you need to know about the change. Since the interest rate on federal student loans will climb by 0.98%, the rate on new undergraduate Stafford loans will rise to 3.734%, up from 2.75% for 2020-2021. This will increase monthly loan payments on a 10-year repayment term to $99.99 from $95.41 for every $10,000 in debt borrowed that academic year, according to Kantrowitz. For graduate students, Kantrowitz projects that Stafford loans will come with a 5.284% interest rate, compared with 4.3% now. This would  push up monthly loan payments on a 10-year repayment  term to $107.46 from $102.68 per $10,000 in debt borrowed, he noted. Lastly, he expects PLUS loans for graduate students and parents will have a 6.284% interest rate, an increase from 5.3%. As a result, monthly loan payments on a 10-year repayment term will increase to $112.45 from $107.54 for each $10,000 in debt borrowed, Kantrowitz said. All federal education loans issued after July 1, 2021, will be subject to the new rates. You can't try to evade the rate increase by borrowing ahead of that deadline. Loans for the 2021-2022 academic year must be taken out after July 1. Don't worry about loans you've taken out for previous academic years: Federal student loan rates are fixed, and the rates on those existing ones won't change. The rate changes apply only to federal student loans. Private loans come with their own — often higher — interest rates. Borrowers can use Kantrowitz's calculator on his website to plug in their loan details and learn what they'll end up owing. He recommends that students not borrow more than they expect to earn in their first year out of college. The average starting salary is $50,000, though there's a wide range between professions. President Joe Biden has said he's in support of forgiving $10,000 in student loans per borrower, and there are currently reports from the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department pending on whether the president has the legal authority to cancel the debt without Congress. The odds of some forgiveness happening have never been greater. Still, "until legislation is signed into law, you can't count on anything," Kantrowitz said. "Students should not borrow more than they need, in the expectation that the debt will be forgiven," he added.
“This is probably the most significant ransomware attack on one of our critical infrastructures ever, a very significant attack,” Congressman John Katko said. The cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline crippled gas delivery systems in Southeastern states. Katko added that there’s still a long way to go to better secure U.S. critical infrastructure.	John Katko (R-N.Y.), ranking member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, told CNBC that the ransomware cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline appears to be part of an escalating series of cyberattacks against the U.S. "This is probably the most significant ransomware attack on one of our critical infrastructures ever, a very significant attack," Katko said. "We've got to understand that even though it wasn't an attack on the operation of a pipeline, it was an attack on the business entity connected to the pipeline." The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack crippled gas delivery systems in Southeastern states. Nearly 70% of gas stations in North Carolina are still empty, and around half are dry in Virginia, Georgia, and South Carolina, according to GasBuddy.com. Colonial restarted operations Wednesday afternoon but said the delivery schedule won't return to normal for several days. Colonial Pipeline paid a $5 million ransom to hackers. Katko told CNBC's " The News with Shepard Smith "  that he doesn't "think it's a great move" for companies to pay the ransom, but if they do, it is critical to follow the money trail. "They almost uniformly, with these ransomware attacks, get paid in cryptocurrencies, and we have to find a better way to find a money trail back to where people are getting the cryptocurrency from because that would help a lot," explained Katko. President Joe Biden  signed an executive order Wednesday mandating significant changes to government cybersecurity standards, aimed at strengthening the nation's cyber defenses in critical sectors of the economy. The congressman added that there's still a long way to go to better secure critical U.S. infrastructure. "We've got electrical grids in this country. We have water systems. We have pipelines. We have a lot of critical infrastructure that is really open to some of these ransomware attacks," Katko said.
Despite a policy banning anti-vaccine messaging on its platform, as of Friday afternoon, Facebook continued to host frames with such claims that users can overlay on top of their profile pictures. After CNBC reached out for comment about one such frame claiming, "MY IMMUNE SYSTEM WORKS BETTER THAN THE" followed by a graphic of a syringe, a Facebook spokesperson confirmed the image had violated its policies and was removed. However, CNBC was quickly able to find well over a dozen other examples of profile picture frames that touted similar messages or at least toed the line of Facebook's policy.	Despite a policy banning anti-vaccine messaging on its platform, as of Friday afternoon, Facebook continued to host profile picture borders that allow users to promote their anti-vax opinions. After CNBC reached out for comment about one such frame claiming, "MY IMMUNE SYSTEM WORKS BETTER THAN THE" followed by a graphic of a syringe, a Facebook spokesperson confirmed the image had violated its policies and was removed. However, CNBC was quickly able to find at least a dozen other examples of profile picture frames that touted similar messages or at least toed the line of Facebook's policy. The spokesperson said Facebook is working to remove variations of the message from its frame options, which appear on top of users' profile pictures. Hours after CNBC's initial outreach, many of the frames are still available for users to add to their profiles. CNBC was able to identify several similar frames to the one removed by simply searching the word "immune" in Facebook's profile picture frame feature. Many included blatantly anti-vaccine messages like "I TRUST MY IMMUNE SYSTEM! #NOTASHOT" and "F*** your Covid vaccine." U.S. government medical authorities have found that people who take the Covid-19 vaccines approved for use in the U.S. have significantly greater protection from the disease compared with people who have not received the vaccines. Authorities have said that the benefits of those Covid vaccines made by Pfizer , Moderna and Johnson & Johnson , far outweigh the risks. Other frames identified by CNBC clearly advocated against vaccines but did not explicitly use the word vaccine or shots. One example of a frame that didn't explicitly mention the vaccine said, "I HAVE AN IMMUNE SYSTEM! #MedicalFreedom" accompanied by, "My body My choice." Another included the messages, "I TRUST MY IMMUNE SYSTEM" with "COVID-19 SURVIVOR" and "MY DNA MY CHOICE," which appears to be a reference to the false claim by anti-vaccine advocates that the shots can alter a person's DNA ( they cannot ). Some include emojis of syringes but no written language about the vaccines. For example, one frame identified by CNBC contained crossed-out images of syringes and the words, "I have an immune system." Facebook did not immediately respond to a question about whether the use of emojis could enable a frame to evade being identified by its system as violating its policies. It also did not immediately provide details about how long the frames had been active and how many users added them or viewed them. The spokesperson noted, however, that pro-vaccine frames have gained a lot of traction on Facebook. "In countries where vaccines are available to most of the population, like the US and the UK, we ramped up our efforts to show people when their friends and neighbors share their support for vaccines through profile frames and stickers," Facebook wrote in a blog post earlier this week. "More than 5 million people globally have used these profile frames. And more than 50% of people in the US on Facebook have already seen someone use the COVID-19 vaccine profile frames, which we developed in collaboration with the US Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention." Throughout the pandemic , Facebook and other social media companies have adopted policies cracking down on misinformation about both the virus and the vaccine. Facebook has a lengthy guide to the type of anti-vaccine content it bans from its site, which includes a prohibition on "Claims that something other than a COVID-19 vaccine can vaccinate you against COVID-19" and "promoting alternative treatments or natural immunity, celebrating those who refuse vaccination, and encouraging vaccine refusals without citing medical rationales or guidance." The number of user-generated frames that still exist with similar messages to the one removed demonstrates how content moderation is often a game of whack-a-mole. The spokesperson did not answer questions about which of the messages would violate its policies but said Facebook is "looking into it." Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

Extra unemployment benefits will end earlier than expected in 20 states, leaving many worried about paying their bills, getting evicted and other consequences. More than 3 million people could be impacted.	Heidi Hansen was making $72,000 a year as a purchasing and warehouse manager in Emmetsburg, Iowa, until she was laid off last month. Her weekly state unemployment benefit of under $500 in Iowa wouldn't be enough to cover her monthly bills, including her $830 mortgage, car insurance and utilities. With the $300 federal boost , though, she could get by and focus on finding a new job, hopefully one that could carry her to retirement. But now that Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has announced that the state will end the federal unemployment programs in less than a month, Hansen is panicked. "I thought I had three to four months," Hansen, 54, said. "And now it's just like, 'You have 30 days, find a job.'" States across the country have announced an early end to their federal unemployment benefits, surprising millions of Americans who thought they could rely on the checks until Sept. 6, when they were set to expire under the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed in March . Some states are stopping the benefits as early as June 12. The cuts could impact more than 3 million people . Republicans have blamed the more generous jobless benefits for slowing down the country's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and labor shortages across a number of sectors. Proponents say the aid gives people the time necessary to find jobs that match their skill level and more bargaining power with employers. A number of large companies, including McDonald's and Chipotle Mexican Grill, have recently announced wage increases to attract more workers. More from Personal Finance: The pandemic drove these Americans into early retirement Small businesses struggle to find workers New college grad job outlook improves for Class of 2021 Hansen worries that the early end to her benefits will force her to take a low-paying job that doesn't match her decades of experience. "I will do what I have to do to eat," she said. "But I worked really hard to build a career. "To go from a manager to a grocery clerk, how's that supposed to look on a resume?" She said it was insulting and frustrating to hear unemployed people be described as lazy and complacent. "I miss working," she said. "I'm reaching out to everyone, saying 'I need a job.' I just keep getting the same story: 'No one is hiring right now.' "There's a lot of people out there who want to work," she said. "They just can't find a job with a decent wage. It takes time, and I don't have that time now." In a country with no paid leave from work, universal health care or child care, and a minimum wage that hasn't increased in more than a decade, unemployment benefits have only become more important for struggling Americans, experts say. "It's going to hurt a lot of people a great deal," said Kate Bronfenbrenner , director of labor education research at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, about the early end of unemployment benefits in 20 states . "We're going to see children go hungry and we're going to see people be evicted." Before the pandemic, Chad Webb worked in plumbing and construction, but now the single father can't take these jobs because he has to be home with his son, Maxx, 4, who's autistic. During the public health crisis, he hasn't been able to find a day-care center in Carlisle, Iowa, that he can afford and that will accept his son, who has difficulty keeping his mask on and social distancing. Webb has plans to get training that would allow him to qualify for a work-from-home job, but that would take time. His unemployment benefits will be cut off in less than a month, after Reynolds' announcement. Without the relief, he won't be able to keep up with his $1,000 rent, and worries that he and his two children, Payton, 12, and Maxx, will be evicted. "I don't know where we'll go," Webb, 43, said, adding that most shelters only take women and children. "You can't just leave people to fend for themselves with 30 days' notice." Sarah Rush was also relying on months of more unemployment benefits, until Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee announced the end of the federal aid effective July 3. During the pandemic, she was laid off from her job as an occupational therapist assistant in a nursing home and she hasn't been able to find a comparable job since. Her husband's back was injured in a military accident in the Iraq War and it's difficult for him to work. As a therapist, Rush earned more than $30 an hour, and she was able to take care of her family. But now the only open positions she sees listed are in fast-food restaurants or factories. "I always made good money, so it's going to be hard making nothing," Rush, 36, said. Before the public health crisis, she commuted from her house in Kentucky to her job in Tennessee, where she's licensed as a therapist. Rush hoped that over the next few months she could try to get licensed in her state, and that by the time she did, hopefully more jobs would open up in the area as the pandemic fades. "I had this plan in my head," she said. "And now I feel very stressed out, like sick. "I don't know what I'm going to do."
Brouillette: If we can move crude more easily, shipping becomes less of a concern. On Monday, an oil tanker off Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coast near the port city of Jeddah was hit by an explosion from an 'external source.' The outgoing U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette visited Abu Dhabi to meet with counterparts from the UAE, Bahrain and Israel to discuss regional energy security.	ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — Outgoing U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette is looking for alternative methods to transport Middle East oil and gas to ensure regional energy security. "Part of the conversation we're having with the Abraham Accords is to look for alternatives to shipping, so that's why these pipelines are so important," Brouillette told CNBC's Hadley Gamble on Wednesday. The energy secretary visited Abu Dhabi this week to meet with ministers from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Israel. Their discussions follow September's signing of the Abraham Accords, which normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab states. With just over four weeks remaining in the role, Brouillette is making a final lap through the region as the Trump era of strong-arm oil diplomacy comes to an end in the U.S. Brouillette will be replaced by Jennifer Granholm, the former governor of Michigan who, unlike her predecessor, is widely seen as a climate hawk. As Brouillette leaves his post, Gulf leaders are questioning how Joe Biden will engage with the region on issues like Iran. Middle East allies still don't know how the United States, a primary external foreign policy actor in the region, will guarantee security and stability of supply to key markets in Asia and beyond. The Middle East holds over half the world's proven oil reserves, but exporting it through the narrow Strait of Hormuz can often prove difficult. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have long sought to find alternative routes to bypass the Strait, including through pipelines. The Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline has a capacity of 1.5 million barrels per day and carries the bulk of its production to the UAE port of Fujairah on the Indian Ocean. Saudi Arabia already exports some of its oil using a 745 mile-long pipeline that runs from its key production facilities in the east to the Red Sea port city of Yanbu in the west. A major expansion of its capacity is already underway. Robin Mills, CEO of Qamar Energy told CNBC there is "no perfect solution" for exports. "Tankers can be vulnerable at certain times, so can pipelines. The point is about having options and having a diversity of routes, about having backup. And that's really what Saudi Arabia and the UAE and tried to do with those pipelines," he said. "Pipelines can be vulnerable, but you can also protect them," Brouillette told CNBC on Wednesday. "If we can move natural gas more easily throughout the region, shipping becomes less of a concern. If we can move crude more easily, shipping becomes less of a concern." Following the establishment of ties with Israel, the UAE is also reportedly looking to collaborate on the transportation of crude and products between the Persian Gulf and Western markets. The Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline, built by Israel and Iran in the 1960s, has a capacity of 600,000 barrels a day and runs from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. "If we can move natural gas to the coast of Egypt or the coast of Israel, then we're moving it through the Mediterranean rather than going through some of the other chokepoints that we're all accustomed to," Brouillette said. On Monday, an oil tanker off Saudi Arabia's port city of Jeddah was hit by an explosion from what Saudi authorities described as an "external source," renewing concerns over the security of tankers in the Red Sea, a passage for global shipping and energy supplies. Oil prices barely jumped on the news, Brouillette pointed out. "I do think that, what we will see over time is what we saw this time with this attack in Saudi Arabia, we didn't see a shock to the marketplace," he said. "That is similar to the Abqaiq attack in the sense that we didn't see a crazy correction in the marketplace. We're starting to see stability, and that's what we want for everyone in the region," he added. The Abqaiq processing facility, the heart of Saudi Arabia's oil production, was hit by drone and missile strikes in September of 2019 along with the kingdom's Khurais oilfield, knocking out half of Saudi oil output overnight. But despite the record oil price surge that followed, gains had evaporated within less than two weeks. "As we think about energy security, it begins to settle down as peace takes hold," Brouillette said. "And as this economic activity increases, I think we'll start to see some decline in these types of attacks."
President Trump said he will veto the sweeping defense bill that authorizes a topline of $740 billion in spending and outlines Pentagon policy. The GOP-led Senate overwhelmingly passed the measure on Friday and sent it to Trump for his signature. The Defense Authorization Act usually passes with strong bipartisan support and veto-proof majorities.	WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Thursday he will reject the sweeping defense bill that authorizes a topline of $740 billion in spending and outlines Pentagon policy. "I will Veto the Defense Bill, which will make China very unhappy. They love it," Trump tweeted. "Must have Section 230 termination, protect our National Monuments and allow for removal of military from far away, and very unappreciative, lands. Thank you!" The Republican-led Senate overwhelmingly passed the National Defense Authorization Act on Friday. The more than 70 members in support of the must-pass bill is more than the two-thirds majority that would be needed to defeat Trump's promised veto. Congress must now vote again to override Trump. The offices of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment on the president's tweet. The bill, which typically passes with strong bipartisan support and veto-proof majorities, authorizes a topline of $740 billion in spending and outlines Pentagon policy. It has been passed for nearly six consecutive decades. NBC News reported that Trump is expected to affirmatively veto the NDAA, rather than employing a maneuver known as a "pocket veto," in which he would simply refuse to sign the bill for 10 days. It's unclear exactly when the president plans to veto the bill. Trump has offered a variety of reasons for opposing the defense bill. Earlier this month, he threatened a veto if lawmakers did not include a measure to eliminate Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , which protects tech giants like Facebook and Twitter from being held legally liable for what is posted on their platforms. Trump has repeatedly accused Twitter , his social media platform of choice, of unfairly censoring him. Trump renewed the threat last week . The president also said the measure posed a serious threat to U.S. national security as well as election integrity but did not give any further explanatory details. The president's issue with Section 230 came to light this summer after Twitter added warning labels to several of his tweets that alleged mail-in voting is fraudulent. Trump has still not conceded the election to President-elect Joe Biden . Trump has also insisted that the defense-spending bill include language preventing the renaming of military bases commemorating Confederate-era figures. The Republican-led Senate Armed Services Committee over the summer approved a provision from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., requiring the Pentagon to rename military assets named after symbols of the Confederacy, the group of states that seceded from the U.S. and fought the Union in the Civil War. "I will Veto the Defense Authorization Bill if the Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren (of all people!) Amendment, which will lead to the renaming (plus other bad things!) of Fort Bragg, Fort Robert E. Lee, and many other Military Bases from which we won Two World Wars, is in the Bill!" Trump tweeted in July. Most recently, Trump has asserted that the bill favors China. This year's legislation includes a 3% pay raise for U.S. troops and a plan to rename military installations bearing names of Confederate leaders. The NDAA, in its current form, does not include any measure related to Section 230.
GM's defensed unit sees $25 billion market in creating new products for the military based off its existing vehicles, parts and technologies. Future opportunities include electric powertrains and vehicles as well as autonomous systems and vehicles — focuses of its GM parent company. GM sold a previous defense unit with the same name to General Dynamics for $1.1 billion in 2003.	DETROIT – General Motors is targeting significant growth for its resurrected military defense unit, which quietly relaunched three years ago and recently started fulfilling its first major U.S. military contract. GM sees a $25 billion market in creating new products for the military based off its existing vehicles, parts and technologies, according to Jeff Ryder, GM Defense vice president of growth and strategy. "That's an addressable market that we feel we have a right to win and pursue. And that's what we're doing," he told CNBC. "As we mature, as we grow, as we build out our operating model, as we have more wins, we will have the opportunity, I think, to continue to vector into other directions or adjacent markets. So that number is not going to get smaller." The company once built tanks for the military during WWII, but it has no plans to stretch that far from its core manufacturing, he said. Ryder, an aerospace and defense industry veteran, said the military needs electric powertrains and vehicles as well as autonomous systems — focuses of its parent company. GM is investing $27 billion in such technologies through 2025. The Detroit automaker sold a previous defense unit with the same name to General Dynamics for $1.1 billion in 2003. Since relaunching GM Defense in 2017, the company has been ramping up the subsidiary and identifying appropriate military contracts to bid on. Due to its current size, GM Defense has not gained much, if any, interest from Wall Street regarding valuation, but executives believe the opportunities for the unit are vast. When GM Defense was reestablished in 2017, it was expected to be a showcase for the automaker's fuel-cell technologies . But much like the consumer market, the demand wasn't yet there due to cost and lack of infrastructure. Ryder said fuel cells remain part of the company's product offering, but GM Defense is now focusing on more near-term business opportunities, including battery-electric vehicles. "The reality is the Army was not and is not yet ready to buy thousands of fuel-cell- powered vehicles," he said, adding "electric vehicles are a very, very real conversation right now." Fuel-cell vehicles operate much like EVs but are powered by electricity generated from hydrogen and oxygen. Such vehicles emit only water while driving and are considered complementary and better for longer trips than battery-electric vehicles. The vehicles can operate on renewable hydrogen made from sources like wind and biomass. GM previously partnered with the U.S. defense industry for evaluation of fuel-cell products, including a Colorado-based pickup called the ZH2 and an unmanned undersea vehicle. The company also has showcased a military vehicle platform called the Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure as a proof of its fuel-cell technologies. Some advantages EVs and fuel cells offer over gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles is its near-instantaneous torque to move quickly as well as lack of noise and thermal detection, according to Ryder. Until the U.S. military is ready to largely adopt such technologies, GM Defense is focusing its near-term operations on vehicles with internal combustion engines as well as more traditional powertrains and technologies. GM Defense was awarded a $214.3 million contract earlier this year by the Army to produce and maintain new Infantry Squad Vehicles, which are used to transport soldiers on battlefields. The company partnered on the contract with Ricardo Defense, which will lead product support for the vehicles. The infantry vehicles are based off GM's Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 midsize truck and leverage 90% commercial off-the-shelf parts, which helps with development and production costs. But unlike the pickup for consumers, the ISVs are light and durable enough to be sling loaded and carried from a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter. "The reach back into GM is huge," Mark Dickens, GM Defense chief engineer, said during a recent media event. "That's the key enabler." GM Defense's interim president, Tim Herrick, who also serves as GM vice president of global product programs, said the ISVs are "just the beginning" for the division. Ryder said other variants, including those with electric powertrains, are possible. GM Defense has started renovating an existing building to support the production of the ISVs in North Carolina. The facility will help manufacture 649 ISVs and will support the production of up to 2,065 vehicles with additional authorization over eight years. The first vehicles delivered to the Army were built at GM's Milford Proving Grounds in Michigan.
Ahead of the holiday season, the Pentagon sent nearly 51,000 pounds of roasted turkey and 7,000 gallons of eggnog to American troops stationed on U.S. military installations around the world. In all, the departments' Defense Logistics Agency delivered nearly 300,000 pounds of traditional holiday food, such as ham and sweet potatoes, to service members throughout the Middle East, Europe and Africa, as well as other locations.	WASHINGTON – Ahead of the holiday season, the Pentagon sent nearly 51,000 pounds of roasted turkey and 7,000 gallons of eggnog to American troops stationed on U.S. military installations around the world. This year, the holiday meals will be switched to grab-and-go style takeout instead of large group gatherings in dining facilities in order to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus , the Pentagon said in a statement. "This year, despite the additional complexities that Covid-19 put in front of us, the DLA Troop Support Subsistence team went above and beyond to make sure our service men and women around the world will have a wonderful Christmas dinner," said Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support Commander Army Brig. Gen. Gavin Lawrence. "Giving our men and women in uniform a taste of home during the holidays, especially in this extraordinarily difficult year, is extremely important," he added. In all, the Pentagon's Defense Logistics Agency delivered nearly 300,000 pounds of traditional holiday food, such as ham and sweet potatoes, to service members throughout the Middle East, Europe and Africa, as well as other locations. This year's menu includes: •           9,000 whole turkeys •           51,000 pounds of roasted turkeys •           74,000 pounds of beef •           21,000 pounds of ham •           67,000 pounds of shrimp •           16,000 pounds of sweet potatoes •           19,000 pounds of pies and cakes •           7,000 gallons of eggnog
President Trump on Wednesday vetoed a sweeping defense bill that authorizes a topline of $740 billion in spending and outlines Pentagon policy. The National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, typically passes with strong bipartisan support and veto-proof majorities. Congress must now vote again to override Trump.	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Wednesday vetoed the sweeping defense bill that authorizes a topline of $740 billion in spending and outlines Pentagon policy. "Unfortunately, the Act fails to include critical national security measures, includes provisions that fail to respect our veterans and our military's history, and contradicts efforts by my administration to put America first in our national security and foreign policy actions," Trump wrote in a lengthy statement to Congress. "It is a 'gift' to China and Russia," the president added, without citing specific details. Earlier this month, the National Defense Authorization Act passed both houses of Congress by veto-proof margins, meaning that any veto by Trump would likely be overridden. Congress must now vote again to override Trump. The House is slated to return from a holiday break on Monday, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said his chamber would vote on overriding the veto Tuesday . This year's 4,517-page defense bill, which typically passes with strong bipartisan support and veto-proof majorities, funds America's national security portfolio. It has been signed into law for nearly six consecutive decades. The bill's passage, at the minimum, secures soldier pay raises and keeps crucial defense modernization programs running. "Donald Trump just vetoed a pay raise for our troops so he can defend dead Confederate traitors," Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer wrote on Twitter, highlighting one of Trump's issues with the must-pass defense bill. "Democrats will vote to override it," Schumer added. "Disturbingly, Trump is using his final hours in office to sow chaos, including by denying our servicemembers a long-overdue pay raise and hazard duty pay; our families paid family leave, child care, housing and health protections; and our veterans the benefits that they need and deserve," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote in a statement. "Next week, December 28, the House will take up the veto override with bipartisan support," she wrote. Other senior Democratic lawmakers criticized Trump, as well. "The Kremlin is actively attacking our cyber networks. Instead of standing up for our national security, the President is downplaying Russia's involvement — which contradicts U.S. intelligence — and now he just vetoed legislation that contains actionable items that we can use to hold Putin accountable for this kind of belligerent behavior," Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, wrote in a statement. "This isn't about politics, this is about the security of the United States and the safety of our men and women in uniform," Shaheen added. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., wrote in a statement that he was speechless after Trump's decision to withhold signature on the NDAA. "Literally right after what could be the most massive cyberattack in our nation's history, the President is eliminating the new tools and authorities we need for our nation's cyber defense," wrote Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "I call on Republican colleagues not only to speak out, but stand up and look forward to a strong, bipartisan override vote," he added. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., wrote on Twitter that he would not vote to override the president's veto. Graham did not vote for the bill the first time. Graham, who chairs the Senate judiciary committee, introduced legislation on Dec. 15 that would end, by Jan. 1, 2023, the protections of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act . Section 230 protects tech giants such as Facebook and Twitter from being held legally liable for what is posted on their platforms. Trump threatened earlier this month to veto the mammoth defense bill if lawmakers did not include a measure to eliminate Section 230. He has repeatedly accused Twitter , his social media platform of choice, of unfairly censoring him. Trump renewed the threat Thursday . In his message to Congress, Trump wrote that the NDAA failed "to make any meaningful changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act." He called on Congress to repeal the measure. The president has previously said the measure posed a serious threat to U.S. national security as well as election integrity but did not give any further explanatory details. Trump has also asserted that the bill favors China. The president's issue with Section 230 came to light this summer after Twitter added warning labels to several of his tweets that alleged mail-in voting is fraudulent. Trump has still not conceded the election to President-elect Joe Biden . The NDAA, in its current form, does not include any measure related to Section 230. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have pushed back on Trump's 11th-hour demand, saying that the repeal of Section 230 is irrelevant to the passage of the Pentagon's top bill. "[Section] 230 has nothing to do with the military," Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman James Inhofe, R-Okla., told reporters Dec. 2 . "I agree with his sentiments, we ought to do away with 230 — but you can't do it in this bill," added Inhofe, a Trump ally. The same day, Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., said, "I don't think the defense bill is the place to litigate" the Section 230 fight, according to The Hill . Trump has also insisted that the defense-spending bill include language preventing the renaming of military bases commemorating Confederate-era figures. The Republican-led Senate Armed Services Committee over the summer approved a provision from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., requiring the Pentagon to rename military assets named after symbols of the Confederacy, the group of states that seceded from the U.S. and fought the Union in the Civil War. Trump, in a multipart Twitter post in June , rejected that idea, contending that the Confederate names of the bases have become part of the nation's great "heritage." "It has been suggested that we should rename as many as 10 of our Legendary Military Bases, such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Benning in Georgia, etc. These Monumental and very Powerful Bases have become part of a Great American Heritage, and a history of Winning, Victory, and Freedom," Trump wrote on Twitter. "The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds, and won two World Wars. Therefore, my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations," the president wrote. — CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report.
The Trump administration blamed Iran for a series of rocket attacks that targeted the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and warned against further aggression. More than 20 rockets were launched Sunday at the heavily fortified Green Zone compound, where the U.S. Embassy and other official buildings are located. "Some friendly health advice to Iran: If one American is killed, I will hold Iran responsible. Think it over," Trump tweeted.	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump blamed Iran on Wednesday for a series of rocket attacks that targeted the U.S. Embassy in Iraq and warned against further aggression. "Our embassy in Baghdad got hit Sunday by several rockets. Three rockets failed to launch. Guess where they were from: IRAN," Trump wrote on Twitter. "Some friendly health advice to Iran: If one American is killed, I will hold Iran responsible. Think it over," Trump wrote, adding that there was "chatter of additional attacks against Americans in Iraq." The president provided no additional details linking Iran to the attack. More than 20 rockets were launched Sunday at the heavily fortified Green Zone compound in Baghdad, where the U.S. Embassy and other official buildings are located. No American casualties were reported. A spokesman for U.S. Central Command, which oversees the wars in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, wrote that Sunday's rocket attack "was almost certainly conducted by an Iranian-backed Rogue Militia Group." "It is important for the people of Iraq to understand that past attacks by the Iranian-backed Rogue Militia Groups have killed more Iraqi civilians and members of the Iraqi Security Forces than they have killed Americans," Navy Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said in a statement. "The United States will hold Iran accountable for the deaths of any Americans that result from the work of these Iranian-backed Rogue Militia Groups," Urban added. The Iraqi military said the attack, which caused minor damage to some of the buildings, was carried out by an "outlaw group." The latest revelation comes as Trump withheld his signature on the must-pass colossal National Defense Authorization Act . The NDAA, which typically passes with strong bipartisan support and veto-proof majorities, funds America's national security portfolio. It has been signed into law for nearly six consecutive decades. The bill's passage, at the minimum, secures soldier pay raises and keeps crucial defense modernization programs running.
In some countries, like Pakistan, militants and radical religious groups spread claims that the polio vaccine is a Western ploy to sterilize Muslim children or turn them away from religion. More than 100 health workers, vaccinators and security officials involved in polio vaccination have been killed since 2012. The violence is an extreme example of the difficulties many poor and developing countries across Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America face as they tackle the monumental task of vaccinating their populations against COVID-19.	Arifullah Khan had just administered another polio vaccine when the gunfire blasted from the nearby hills. "It happened so suddenly. There was so much gunfire it felt like an explosion," he said, recalling details of the attack five years ago in Pakistan's Bajaur tribal region near the Afghan border. A bullet shattered his thigh and he fell to the ground. His childhood friend and partner in the vaccination campaign, Ruhollah, lay bleeding on the ground in front of him. "I couldn't move," Khan said. "I watched him lying right in front of me as he took his last breath." In Pakistan, delivering vaccines can be deadly. Militants and radical religious groups spread claims that the polio vaccine is a Western ploy to sterilize Muslim children or turn them away from religion. More than 100 health workers, vaccinators and security officials involved in polio vaccination have been killed since 2012. The violence is an extreme example of the difficulties many poor and developing countries across Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America face as they tackle the monumental task of vaccinating their populations against COVID-19. It's not just the problem of affording vaccines or being at the back of the line behind wealthy countries in receiving them. Poor infrastructure often means roads are treacherous and electricity is sporadic for the refrigerators vital to preserving vaccines. Wars and insurgencies endanger vaccinators. Corruption can siphon away funds, and vaccination campaign planners must sometimes navigate through multiple armed factions. "The most challenging areas ... are conflict settings, where outbreaks of violence hinder vaccinations, and areas where misinformation is circulating, which discourages community participation," said UNICEF's deputy chief of global immunization, Benjamin Schreiber. Many nations are relying on COVAX, an international system aimed at ensuring equitable access to vaccines, though it is already short on funding. UNICEF, which runs immunization programs worldwide, is gearing up to help procure and administer COVID-19 vaccines, Schreiber told The Associated Press. It has stockpiled half a billion syringes and aims to provide 70,000 refrigerators, mostly solar powered, he said. The agency aims to transport 850 tons of COVID-19 vaccines a month next year, double its usual annual monthly rate for other vaccines, UNICEF's executive director Henrietta Fore said in a statement. The situation can vary widely from country to country. Mexico is expected to start immunizations soon. The military will handle distribution, and the government has promised free vaccines for Mexico's nearly 130 million inhabitants by the end of 2021. Meanwhile, Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest country, has yet to announce any vaccination plans. Health experts worry that widespread rumors could set back vaccinations — including claims that hospitals will give fatal injections to inflate COVID-19 death figures and receive more foreign aid. The African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is leading a continent-wide effort to vaccinate Africa's 1.3 billion people in 54 countries. The agency is coordinating efforts to obtain doses and seeking World Bank help in funding — estimating it will take $10 billion to acquire, distribute and administer the vaccines. The aim is to vaccinate 60% of Africa's population within two years — some 700 million people — more than the continent has done in the past, said John Nkengasong, director of the African CDC. "The time for action is now," said Nkengasong. "The West cannot defeat COVID-19 alone. It must be defeated by all over the world, and that includes Africa." Congo underscores the obstacles the campaign faces. The country has overcome Ebola outbreaks with vaccination campaigns. But it struggled in eastern Congo, where Allied Democratic Forces rebels stage frequent attacks and other armed groups vie for control of mineral riches. Rough terrain and insecurity meant vaccinators had trouble getting to all areas. Some came under attack. Rumors flew about the Ebola vaccines, including the idea they were meant to kill people, said Dr. Maurice Kakule, an Ebola survivor who worked in vaccination campaigns. Education programs overcame much of the resistance, but similar suspicions are spreading about the COVID-19 vaccine, he said. In Beni, the area's main city, Danny Momoti, a trader, said he would take the vaccine because of his work. "I need this COVID-19 vaccination card to be accepted in Dubai and elsewhere where I go to buy the goods for Beni," he said. Civil wars present perhaps the greatest obstacles. In Yemen, the health system has collapsed under six years of war between Houthi rebels who control the north and government-allied factions in the south. Yemen saw its first outbreak of polio in 15 years this summer, centered in the northern province of Saada. Vaccinators haven't been able to work there the past two years, in part because of security fears, UNICEF said. Agencies rushed to give new inoculations in parts of the north and south in November and December. Cholera and diphtheria have been rampant, and once again, Yemen faces a new surge in hunger. U.N. officials have warned of potential famine in 2021 . No plans for COVID-19 vaccinations have been announced yet, whether by the Houthis, southern authorities or WHO and UNICEF. Only half of Yemen's health facilities remain functional. Roads, power networks and other infrastructure have been devastated. The Houthis have hampered some programs, trying to wrest concessions from U.N. agencies, including blocking a shipment of cholera vaccines amid a 2017 outbreak. "Even the mildest and normally preventable diseases can prove fatal due to a lack of health care access in a conflict setting," said Wasim Bahja, the Yemen country director for International Medical Corps. In Pakistan, public distrust was fueled when the CIA in 2011 used a scam vaccination program to identify the hideout of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, leading to the special forces raid that killed him. Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria are the only countries in the world where polio is still endemic. There have been 82 new polio cases this year alone, largely because vaccinations were suspended due to the pandemic, said Dr. Rana Safdar, who coordinates the polio vaccination campaigns. The Bajaur region, where Khan was shot, remains one of the more dangerous areas, Safdar said. Khan tried to explain the deep mistrust in his region. Deeply conservative tribal elders "believe the vaccine is the reason the young people who were given it as children are disrespectful and show little concern for Islamic traditions and values." "Everyone is scared" of COVID-19, he said. "But they are suspicious of Western things." Khan said he signed up to administer polio vaccines because he was paid the equivalent of $56 for just a few days' work. "I needed to feed my family." He will likely sign up to deliver COVID-19 vaccines as well. "But first I would check if there is any danger there," he said.
The House voted Monday to override President Donald Trump's veto of an annual defense spending bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said his chamber would vote on overriding the veto Tuesday. The $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act funds America's national security portfolio.	WASHINGTON — The House voted Monday to override President Donald Trump's veto of an annual defense spending bill , placing the final steps of defying the Republican president in the hands of the GOP-led Senate. The measure to override Trump's veto of the defense bill passed 322 to 87 on Monday evening. The Senate will vote next on whether to override the veto. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said his chamber would vote on overriding the veto Tuesday . The bill, known as the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, passed the House on Dec. 8. with the support of more than three-fourths of the chamber. A large majority of the GOP-controlled Senate also approved the bill , giving both chambers a higher share of yea votes than the two-thirds required to defeat a presidential veto. The sweeping defense bill, that authorizes a topline of $740 billion in spending and outlines Pentagon policy, typically passes with strong bipartisan support and veto-proof majorities as it funds America's national security portfolio. It has been signed into law every year for nearly six consecutive decades. The bill's passage, at the minimum, secures soldier pay raises and keeps crucial defense modernization programs running. Trump offered a variety of reasons for opposing this year's 4,517-page NDAA, taking issue with the bill both for what it contains and what it lacks. The president has demanded that the bill include language stripping social media companies of protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which guards them from being held liable for what users say on their platforms. Trump, who has used Twitter prolifically throughout his presidency, has long accused media outlets of bias. In his veto message to Congress, Trump wrote that the NDAA failed "to make any meaningful changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act." He called on Congress to repeal the measure. The president has previously said the measure posed a serious threat to U.S. national security as well as election integrity but did not give any further explanatory details. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., wrote on Twitter last week that he would not vote to override the president's veto. Graham did not vote for the bill the first time. Graham, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, introduced legislation on Dec. 15 that would end, by Jan. 1, 2023, the protections of Section 230 .
President-elect Joe Biden said Monday his transition team has run into "roadblocks" and "obstruction" from Trump administration officials at key agencies. Biden singled out the Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget, saying his team has "encountered roadblocks from the political leadership" at those agencies. "It's nothing short, in my view, of irresponsibility," Biden said.	President-elect Joe Biden said Monday his transition team has run into "roadblocks" and "obstruction" from Trump administration leaders at key agencies, hindering the incoming administration's efforts to prepare for the presidency. But one of those agency chiefs, acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, pushed back on Biden's critique, marking the latest row between President Donald Trump's Pentagon and the president-elect. "The truth is, many of the agencies that are critical to our security have incurred enormous damage," Biden said during remarks in Delaware following a briefing from his national security and foreign policy agency review teams. "Many of them have been hollowed out, in personnel, capacity, and in morale. Policy processes have atrophied or have been sidelined," he said. Biden, who is set to take office in less than a month, singled out the Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget in his speech. "From some agencies, our team has received exemplary cooperation," Biden said. "From others, most notably the Department of Defense, we've encountered obstruction from the political leadership of that department." He later added: "We've encountered roadblocks from the political leadership in the Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget. Right now, we just aren't getting all the information that we need from the outgoing administration in key national security areas." "It's nothing short, in my view, of irresponsibility," Biden said. In a statement later Monday, acting Defense chief Miller defended his agency's coordination with Biden's team. "The Department of Defense has conducted 164 interviews with over 400 officials, and provided over 5,000 pages of documents – far more than initially requested by Biden's transition team," Miller's statement said. Included in that statement is a bulleted list of "transition facts," which notes that all interviews with the transition team are, for the first time, being conducted virtually in light of the coronavirus pandemic . The agency's efforts "already surpass those of recent administrations with over three weeks to go," Miller said, "and we continue to schedule additional meetings for the remainder of the transition and answer any and all requests for information in our purview." Defense Department officials, the statement added, "have been working with the utmost professionalism to support transition activities in a compressed time schedule and they will continue to do so in a transparent and collegial manner that upholds the finest traditions of the Department. The American people expect nothing less and that is what I remain committed to." The Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. Biden applauded his agency review teams for doing an "outstanding job" despite the pandemic and the delays in receiving federal funding from Trump's General Services Administration . Those obstacles came as the president has refused to concede to Biden and as his campaign legal team and others continue their efforts to overturn the election. A pressing concern, Biden said, is ensuring "that nothing is lost in the handoff between administrations." "We need full visibility into the budget planning underway at the Defense Department and other agencies in order to avoid any window of confusion or catch-up that our adversaries may try to exploit." While the president-elect's remarks were among his most critical of the Trump administration from the Wilmington lectern, they were not the first instance of Biden's struggles with Trump's Defense Department. The tensions between the Pentagon and Biden's team spilled into public view earlier this month, over a dispute about Miller's decision to cancel meetings with the transition team for the rest of the year . Miller said in a statement that there was a "mutually agreed upon holiday pause," but a Biden spokesman shot back that no such agreement was made. "Let me be clear: There was no mutually agreed-upon holiday break," transition spokesman Yohannes Abraham had told reporters. It was weeks after the election that Defense officials confirmed the transition process within the Pentagon had begun . "The first meeting today was by video conference, It was a good, productive meeting where we sort of laid down some of the ground rules," Tom Muir, director of the Washington Headquarters Services, said during a Nov. 24 Pentagon briefing. "They are looking forward to participating in discussions here in the Pentagon," added Muir, who facilitates the transition process. Muir said at the time that the Biden team will have dedicated office space in the Pentagon and appropriate access to intelligence.
President Donald Trump has launched a full-bore attack on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Section 230 shields tech companies from being held liable for what users post on their platforms. Trump wants it repealed. The president has tied the issue to the passage of a crucial annual defense spending bill and, more recently, to the prospect of approving an increase in coronavirus relief checks to $2,000 from $600.	President Donald Trump is pressuring his Republican allies over a law that has protected social media companies for decades. In his final weeks in office, Trump has launched a full-bore attack on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , the 1996 law that shields tech companies from being held liable for what users post on their platforms. Trump wants Section 230 gone. He has tied the issue to the passage of a crucial annual defense spending bill and, more recently, to the prospect of approving an increase in coronavirus relief checks to $2,000 from $600 . "Unless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP. $600 IS NOT ENOUGH!" Trump tweeted Tuesday. "Also, get rid of Section 230 - Don't let Big Tech steal our Country, and don't let the Democrats steal the Presidential Election. Get tough!" he wrote. Politicians on both sides of the aisle — including President-elect Joe Biden — have voiced complaints about Section 230, and some have taken steps toward reforming the provision. But there's little appetite on Capitol Hill for repealing it outright, much less for slipping such a repeal into the $740 billion defense bill or the latest pandemic relief legislation. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., appears to have taken heed of Trump's demands. On Tuesday afternoon, McConnell introduced a bill that would directly couple an increase in stimulus checks with a repeal of Section 230. That bill would also form a bipartisan commission to study the "integrity and administration" of the 2020 election, which Trump has falsely insisted he won over Biden. McConnell's bill is highly unlikely to reach the 60-vote threshold required to pass in the Senate. But its failure could be a win for Republican lawmakers, many of whom had opposed a boost in stimulus checks and were caught off-guard by Trump's late-stage demand. Here's what to know about Section 230 and where it stands: Section 230 was written by former Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif., and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., following a 1995 court ruling against the online service Prodigy. That company had been sued for defamation after an anonymous user on its platform accused an investment firm of fraud. The court ruled that because Prodigy moderated some of the posts on the platform, it should be treated like a publisher. Cox and Wyden, disagreeing with that decision, introduced Section 230 as a way of protecting tech companies from becoming legally liable for their users' content if they opted to moderate it. The law allows for companies to engage in "good Samaritan" moderation of some material without being treated like a publisher or speaker under the law. More than two decades later, the prospect of repealing Section 230 would likely be a dealbreaker for many lawmakers. Throughout countless discussions about reforming the liability shield , members have largely agreed that some of its protections are important for the continued function of an open and relatively safe internet. For example, the law not only protects tech platforms from being held accountable for their users' posts, but it also allows them to remove "objectionable" messages. While the term is open for the platforms' interpretations, that portion of the law allows companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google's YouTube to swiftly remove messages of terrorism, violence or self-harm without fearing that a lapse of judgment will land them in legal trouble. And while conservatives aim for fewer restrictions to be imposed on their posts, repealing Section 230 could result in even more limitations. Without its liability protection, platforms could be incentivized to screen more content before it can be uploaded. Some Democrats have also soured on the law. Biden voiced distaste for Section 230, telling the New York Times editorial board in January that the protection "immediately should be revoked" for tech platforms including Facebook. But that remedy seems to fall beyond many Democrats' wishes, which often include imposing more responsibility for platforms to moderate posts as allowed by Section 230. The National Defense Authorization Act, which typically passes with overwhelming bipartisan support and veto-proof majorities, is a sweeping defense bill that authorizes a topline of $740 billion in spending and outlines Pentagon policy. This year's legislation includes a 3% pay raise for U.S. troops, a plan to rename military installations bearing names of Confederate leaders, and a slew of other provisions. In mid-December, the NDAA passed the House and the GOP-led Senate with veto-proof majorities in both chambers. Trump nevertheless vetoed the bill last week, in large part because it lacked language repealing Section 230. The move forced many GOP lawmakers into the uncomfortable position of possibly overriding a veto from a Republican president who commands strong support within his party. The Democrat-majority House on Monday voted to override Trump's veto , and McConnell is poised to push forward with a similar vote in his chamber. Trump, who refuses to concede his loss to Biden in an election where down-ballot Republicans outperformed expectations, is still heaping pressure on his political allies to fulfill his demand to gut Section 230. "Weak and tired Republican 'leadership' will allow the bad Defense Bill to pass," Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. "Say goodbye to VITAL Section 230 termination," he wrote before listing other grievances with the NDAA. "A disgraceful act of cowardice and total submission by weak people to Big Tech. Negotiate a better Bill, or get better leaders, NOW! Senate should not approve NDAA until fixed!!!" The president had signed the coronavirus relief and government spending bill into law Sunday . That bill includes $600 direct payments for Americans — but days before signing it, Trump called for those payments to be bumped up to $2,000 . McConnell on the Senate floor Tuesday outlined three priorities Trump had asked Congress to address when he signed that Covid bill: larger direct payments, questions about Section 230 and unfounded concerns about widespread election fraud. "This week, the Senate will begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus," McConnell said. McConnell followed through on those remarks later in the day, by adding a bill to the Senate calendar that would combine a direct-payment boost, a repeal of Section 230 and the establishment of an election commission. The GOP leader had blocked a bid from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, to unanimously pass an increase in stimulus checks to $2,000. Schumer promptly slammed McConnell's bill as a "cynical gambit" to give cover to Republicans while depriving struggling Americans of much-needed funds. "Senator McConnell knows how to make $2,000 survival checks reality and he knows how to kill them," Schumer said in a statement. "If Sen. McConnell tries loading up the bipartisan House-passed CASH Act with unrelated, partisan provisions that will do absolutely nothing to help struggling families across the country, it will not pass the House and cannot become law – any move like this by Sen. McConnell would a blatant attempt to deprive Americans of a $2,000 survival check. "Will Senate Republicans go along with Sen. McConnell's cynical gambit or will they push him to give a vote on the standalone House-passed CASH Act?" Schumer's statement said. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle had already pushed back on Trump's 11th-hour demand to include the repeal of Section 230 in the NDAA, saying it was irrelevant to its passage. "First of all, 230 has nothing to do with the military," Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters earlier this month. "We ought to do away with 230, but you can't do it in this bill. That's not a part of the bill," Inhofe added. "You're mad at Twitter. We all know it. You're willing to veto the defense bill over something that has everything to do with your ego, and nothing to do with defense," Rep. Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington and chair of the House Armed Services Committee, said on the heels of Trump's veto threat. Meanwhile, some GOP senators, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., said they would be supportive of Trump vetoing the NDAA in order to repeal or reform Section 230. Last week, Graham, wrote on Twitter that he would not vote to override the president's veto. Graham did not vote for the bill the first time. Additionally, Graham who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, introduced legislation earlier this month that would end, by Jan. 1, 2023, the protections of Section 230 unless Congress takes action sooner. The bill seeks to incentivize lawmakers to take action on much-discussed reforms, which have so far failed to reach a consensus. Graham has introduced other bills that would modify, though not fully revoke, the protections of Section 230.
Under outgoing President Donald Trump, many of the potential flashpoints between the NATO allies were smoothed over thanks to a friendly relationship between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Looking ahead to a Joe Biden administration, there's a chance that some of those tensions could blow up — but there is also chance for reconciliation.	Tensions between the U.S. and Turkey have been mounting for a while. But under outgoing President Donald Trump, many of the potential flashpoints between the NATO allies were smoothed over thanks to a friendly relationship between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Looking ahead to a Joe Biden administration, there's a chance that some of those tensions could blow up — but there is also chance for reconciliation. Whatever happens, the next four years for Turkey and its relationship with Washington are likely to look very different from the last four. "The only thing holding the relationship together for the last several years has been Trump's personal relationship with Erdogan," Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, told CNBC. "With Trump removed, Erdogan should be very, very worried." That's because there is no shortage of conflict points between Ankara and Washington; points that reveal contrasting attitudes toward geopolitics, alliances and governance. Among those are human rights in Turkey, which Democrats in particular have spoken out against; Turkey's purchase of Russia's S-400 missile system which angered its NATO allies and nearly triggered U.S. sanctions; and its military action against America's Kurdish allies in northern Syria and support for Islamic extremist groups, which Ankara argues are not terrorists and are necessary to protect its interests in the region. There are also Erdogan's aggressive moves against Greece and Cyprus over gas resources in the Eastern Mediterranean; Turkey's alleged role in helping Iran skirt U.S. sanctions; and the shared Incirlik air base, where Turkey hosts a huge number of American troops, aircraft and some 50 of its nuclear warheads — and which Erdogan has threatened to cut off if hit with U.S. sanctions. So, that's a lot. What has Biden said on some of these issues? Based on his previous statements, it looks like there will be a tougher line from Washington. In an interview last January, Biden called Erdogan an "autocrat," criticized his actions toward the Kurds and said that the Turkish leader "has to pay a price." He also suggested the U.S. should support Turkish opposition leaders "to be able to take on and defeat Erdogan. Not by a coup, but by the electoral process." Biden has pledged to recognize the Armenian genocide, a hugely contentious issue for Turkey and one which U.S. presidents have avoided acknowledging for a century. Amid the turmoil of World War I, as many as 1.5 million Armenian civilians were expelled or killed by what was then the Ottoman Empire. No government of Turkey has ever acknowledged it as a genocide. Turkey and Armenia do not have diplomatic relations. Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike have supported sanctions over both Turkey's military assaults on the Kurds, viewed by Ankara as terrorists, and its buying and testing of the Russian S-400 missile defense system. Sanctions would be a devastating blow to Turkey's already suffering economy. For its part, Turkey has threatened retaliation for any sanctions, including hamstringing the Americans over the highly strategic Incirlik air base. Erdogan has previously slammed Biden for being an "interventionist." Still, Erdogan spokesman Ibrahim Kalin on Wednesday said Turkey believes it can have a "good and positive agenda" with a Biden administration, and called any punishment for its S-400 purchase "counterproductive." Both the U.S. and Europe have become "increasingly frustrated" with Erdogan's emboldened foreign interventions and "erratic" behavior toward allies and adversaries alike, said Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at the at the Economist Intelligence Unit. "This is a dangerous path," she said. "The incoming Biden administration is likely to take a much tougher stance on Turkey than Donald Trump has done." But that comes with its own set of risks to the U.S. — namely, that punishing an ally like Turkey only pushes it further into the arms of Russia. "The U.S. would be shooting itself in the foot... if placed under stringent U.S. sanctions, Turkey would double down on its attempts to deepen its relations with Russia and Iran," Demarais said. With the second-largest military in NATO and strategic access to American operations in the Middle East, Turkey is a partner many believe the U.S. can't afford to lose to an adversary. Not everyone sees a dire future as a foregone conclusion for Washington and Ankara. Turkey is "mega strategic" for the U.S. and Europe, stressed Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management. Because of this, he expects that "Biden will work overtime to try and improve relations with Turkey and bring the country back into the Western fold." "I think it is important to remember that the two biggest risks to the U.S. are China and Russia," Ash said. "'Winning' Turkey back from Russia would be a huge win for Biden, and I think they will focus on that." It's also worth noting that the relationship during Trump's tenure wasn't always rosy. In August of 2018, Trump threatened sanctions on Turkey over its detention of an American pastor — a threat that sent the Turkish lira to its then-lowest level ever against the dollar and intensified its deepening economic crisis. Now, with its currency at record lows, high inflation and unemployment exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, any clashes with the U.S. that risk sanctions are even more perilous for the Turkish economy. Investors and regional analysts will be watching the Biden-Erdogan dynamic over the coming months to see whether, in the words of Turkish academic Ahmed Alioglu, "Turkey should get ready for a rocky four years ahead."
The nation's 10 living secretaries of Defense, in a Washington Post op-ed, warned Sunday that the U.S. military should have no role in determining the outcome of a U.S. election. The former Defense secretaries, who have collectively overseen America's military forces for nearly 50 years, argued that "the time for questioning the results" of the U.S. presidential election has passed. "Civilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable, including potentially facing criminal penalties, for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic," they added.	WASHINGTON – As President Donald Trump scrambles to fuel claims of a stolen election in the final days of his administration, the nation's 10 living secretaries of Defense warned Sunday that the U.S. military should have no role in determining the outcome of a U.S. election. "Each of us swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. We did not swear it to an individual or a party," penned Defense secretaries Mark Esper, James Mattis, Ash Carter, Chuck Hagel, Leon Panetta, Dick Cheney, William Cohen, Robert Gates, William Perry and Donald Rumsfeld in an op-ed published Sunday in The Washington Post . "Efforts to involve the U.S. armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory," wrote the former Defense secretaries. "Civilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable, including potentially facing criminal penalties, for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic," they added. The former Defense secretaries, who have collectively overseen America's military forces for nearly 50 years, argued that "the time for questioning the results" of the U.S. presidential election has passed. "Our elections have occurred. Recounts and audits have been conducted. Appropriate challenges have been addressed by the courts. Governors have certified the results. And the electoral college has voted. The time for questioning the results has passed; the time for the formal counting of the electoral college votes, as prescribed in the Constitution and statute, has arrived," wrote the former Defense secretaries, including two that served under Trump. The secretaries called on Trump's acting Defense secretary Christopher Miller as well as political appointees and civil servants to "refrain from any political actions that undermine the results of the election or hinder the success of the new team." "We call upon them, in the strongest terms, to do as so many generations of Americans have done before them. This final action is in keeping with the highest traditions and professionalism of the U.S. armed forces, and the history of democratic transition in our great country," they wrote. Trump, despite a slew of failed legal challenges, has not conceded the election to Democrat Joe Biden, who will be inaugurated Jan. 20. Instead, Trump has touted false claims of a rigged election and has pushed members  of his own party to engage in plots to reverse Biden's victory, lashing out when they express opposition to his schemes. Over the weekend, Trump's ambitions came to light in an extraordinary leaked phone call with Georgia's Republican secretary of state. During the call with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the president said he wanted "to find 11,780 votes " that would overturn Biden's win in Georgia, according to audio obtained by NBC News. Raffensperger resisted pressure from Trump to change Georgia's election results even as the president made veiled threats about potential criminal prosecution if he was refused. At least 12 Republican senators have called for Congress to delay certification of Biden's victory during a joint session Wednesday. Vice President Mike Pence, who will preside over the session, has welcomed the ploy by the senators, which has no chance of succeeding because Democrats control the House and several Republicans oppose the move. Republican Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, among others, have expressed strong opposition to attempts to reverse Biden's victory. Pro-Trump protests are scheduled to take place Wednesday in the nation's capital as Congress convenes to certify Biden as the new president and Kamala Harris as vice president. Trump said he will attend the protests.
The scenes of crowds storming into the U.S. Capitol shocked foreign powers around the world. Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson described the unfolding protest in Washington as "disgraceful." Other world leaders expressed regret and dismay.	WASHINGTON – Foreign leaders and diplomats issued unusually stark statements condemning the pro-Trump riots that broke out in Washington and forced the U.S. Congress to recess from the joint session that was scheduled to formally announce President-elect Joe Biden's victory in November's election . President Donald Trump, during a rally earlier outside the White House, had encouraged thousands of his supporters to march to the Capitol and protest the proceedings there. Trump returned to the White House after his speech and later told supporters in a tweeted video " you have to go home now ." "This was a fraudulent election ... but you have to go home," Trump said, telling protesters "We love you. You are very special," before signing off. In a series of tweets Wednesday evening, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the storming of the U.S. Capitol "unacceptable." "Lawlessness and rioting -- here or around the world -- is always unacceptable," the nation's top diplomat wrote. "Let us swiftly bring justice to the criminals who engaged in this rioting," Pompeo wrote, adding "America is better than what we saw today." The scenes of crowds storming into the U.S. Capitol shocked foreign powers around the world. Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson described the unfolding protest in Washington as "disgraceful." "The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power," Johnson wrote in a tweet. "The world is watching! We hope for restoration of calm," wrote Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. He added that the images pouring out of Washington were "shocking" and that the events were "a deliberate assault on democracy." Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also expressed concern about the violent scenes and said he was following the situation "minute by minute." "I think the American democratic institutions are strong, and hopefully everything will return to normal shortly," Trudeau told the News 1130 Vancouver radio station. In a recorded statement, French President Emmanuel Macron said "what happened today in Washington, D.C., is not America, definitely." "We believe in the strength of American democracy," he added. "The violent acts against American institutions are a grave attack against democracy," wrote Jean-Yves Le Drian, France's Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs. "The American people's will and vote must be respected," he added. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for the "orderly and peaceful transfer of power." "The democratic process cannot be allowed to be subverted through unlawful protests," he wrote. Volkan Bozkir, the President of the United Nations General Assembly, wrote that he was hopeful "democratic processes will prevail." "I'm saddened & concerned by today's developments at the Capitol in #WashingtonDC . The US is one of the world's major democracies," he added. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez wrote that he was following the updates from Washington and that he was hopeful a Biden administration would be able to unite Americans. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven in a tweet described the events as "an assault on democracy." "President Trump and several members of Congress bear substantial responsibility for developments. The democratic election process must be respected," he added. Similarly, Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg wrote that Trump was responsible for stopping the violence in Washington. "Scary pictures, and amazing that this is the United States," Solberg added. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called the violence "shocking" and urged Americans to respect the outcome of the November election, a call echoed by European Parliament President David Sassoli. Sassoli, who oversees the lawmaking party of the European Union, wrote that the scenes from the U.S. Capitol were "deeply concerning." "Democratic votes must be respected. We are certain the U.S. will ensure that the rules of democracy are protected," added Sassoli. Joseph Borrell Fontelles, the European Union's High Representative of the Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, wrote in a pair of tweets that "American democracy tonight appears under siege." "This is an unseen assault on U.S. democracy, its institutions and the rule of law. This is not America," he added. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, also wrote on Twitter, "I believe in the strength of US institutions and democracy. Peaceful transition of power is at the core. Joe Biden won the election." "I look forward to working with him as the next President of the USA," she added. "The US Congress is a temple of democracy," wrote President of the European Council Charles Michel in a tweet. "To witness tonight's scenes in #WashingtonDC is a shock," he added. World leaders, like the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, called on Trump to recognize the incoming Biden administration in order to help quell protests. Turkey's Foreign Ministry issued a statement warning Turkish citizens in the United States to be wary of further violence. "We believe that the U.S. will overcome this internal political crisis in a mature matter. We advise Turkish citizens in the U.S. to avoid crowded areas and places where protests are taking place," the statement said.
Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis placed the blame squarely on President Donald Trump for the riot that ensued at the U.S. Capitol. Mattis, who served as Trump's first defense secretary, said the president has used the nation's highest role in government to "destroy trust in our election and to poison our respect for fellow citizens."	WASHINGTON – Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis on Wednesday evening placed the blame squarely on President Donald Trump for the riot that ensued on the U.S. Capitol . "Today's violent assault on our Capitol, an effort to subjugate American democracy by mob rule, was fomented by Mr. Trump," Mattis wrote in a statement. Mattis, who served as Trump's first Defense secretary, said the president has used the nation's highest role in government to "destroy trust in our election and to poison our respect for fellow citizens." "Our Constitution and our Republic will overcome this stain and We the People will come together again in our never-ending effort to form a more perfect Union, while Mr. Trump will deservedly be left a man without a country," Mattis wrote. Read more: National Guard heads to the Capitol to tamp down pro-Trump insurrection The stinging statement from the revered Marine with a military career spanning four decades is the second time Mattis has broken his silence since leaving the Trump administration. Last June, Mattis ripped into Trump after protestors were forcibly cleared from Lafayette Square in order for the president to participate in a photo-op with some members of his cabinet. The ensuing civil unrest, some of which turned violent, prompted Trump to call for governors to use harsher tactics and greater force when confronting protesters. The protests, which rocked D.C. for more than a week, were sparked by the police killing of George Floyd. Floyd died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. "Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people—does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us," Mattis wrote in a scathing statement published by The Atlantic. "We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership," he wrote, adding that he "watched this week's unfolding events, angry and appalled," the four-star Marine wrote. On Sunday, the nation's 10 living secretaries of Defense penned an ominous warning that the U.S. military should have no role in determining the outcome of a U.S. election.

Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said: "The violence to our Nation's Capitol Building is an intolerable attack on a fundamental institution of our democracy." Earlier Wednesday, the Department of Justice sent hundreds of federal law enforcement officers and agents from the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the U.S. Marshals Service to help quell protests. Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia called the riots "a low point in the history of American democracy." Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Chad Wolf also condemned the violence, saying "no one has the right to attack ANY federal institution regardless of motivation." He added that those who engaged in the rioting should be held accountable. Secretary Ben Carson of Housing and Urban Development said: "End this violence now. Violence is never an appropriate response regardless of legitimate concerns. Please remember: if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand," Carson wrote. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar wrote that he was "disgusted" by the riot. "Physical violence and the desecration of this hallowed symbol of our democracy must end," Azar added. "Most importantly, I want all of you to stay safe. Please take care of yourselves and loved ones," Azar wrote in a subsequent tweet. In a tweet Wednesday evening, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin wrote "Violence is always unacceptable. We must respect our constitution and democratic process." Similarly, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross wrote on Twitter that "violence is never the proper solution." Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said "we must set a better example" for America's children and students.
The FBI tweeted that "we are accepting tips and digital media depicting rioting or violence." The mayhem at the U.S. Capitol resulted in the deaths of four people and led to 52 arrests.	WASHINGTON — The FBI is requesting the public help identify people who took part in the pro-Trump riots at the U.S. Capitol. "We are accepting tips and digital media depicting rioting or violence in and around the U.S. Capitol on January 6," an FBI tweet said. "If you have witnessed unlawful violent actions, we urge you to submit any information, photos, or videos that could be relevant at fbi.gov/USCapitol ," the agency said in a subsequent statement. The mayhem at the U.S. Capitol resulted in the deaths of four people and led to 52 arrests . More than 50 U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. police officers sustained injuries during the attack on the Capitol, wrote Steven Sund, the Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police, in a statement Thursday. The riots that broke out in Washington forced Congress to recess from the joint session that was scheduled to formally announce President-elect Joe Biden's victory in November's election . After the Capitol had been secured, Biden's victory over President Donald Trump was confirmed by Congress in the early hours of Thursday. Trump, during a Wednesday rally outside the White House , encouraged thousands of supporters to march to the Capitol to protest what historically have been ceremonial proceedings. Trump returned to the White House after his speech. During the subsequent rioting, Trump told supporters in a tweeted video " you have to go home now ," but he didn't condemn the violence and continued to falsely claim he won the election. Twitter later removed that tweet and locked the president's account. In a statement Thursday, Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary, Chad Wolf, called on Trump to "strongly condemn the violence," calling the events "tragic and sickening." "This is unacceptable. These violent actions are unconscionable, and I implore the President and all elected officials to strongly condemn the violence that took place yesterday," Wolf said. "Any appearance of inciting violence by an elected official goes against who we are as Americans. Every American is guaranteed the right to peacefully protest, but once those protests become violent, we should enforce our laws and bring those responsible to justice—regardless of political motivations." In a tweet Wednesday, Wolf wrote that those who engaged in the rioting should be held accountable.

Former Attorney General William Barr called President Donald Trump's actions a "betrayal of his office and supporters." Barr, who ran the Department of Justice, was one of Trump's most loyal defenders in the president's Cabinet. He left the Trump administration in December.	WASHINGTON — Former Attorney General William Barr has called President Donald Trump's actions a "betrayal of his office and supporters" after pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol. In a statement obtained by NBC News on Thursday, Barr said Trump was responsible for "orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress," calling his former boss' actions "inexcusable." The Associated Press first reported the news. Barr, who ran the Department of Justice, was one of Trump's most loyal defenders in the president's Cabinet. He left the Trump administration last month after publicly breaking with the president over election fraud claims. In early December, Barr said the Department of Justice had not found any evidence of widespread voter or election fraud that would result in overturning Democrat Joe Biden's victory. Barr's condemnation comes a day after the rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol, forcing Congress to recess from the joint session that was scheduled to formally announce Biden's victory in November's election . Biden's victory was confirmed by Congress in the early hours of Thursday after the Capitol had been secured from the rioting Trump supporters. The pandemonium at the U.S. Capitol resulted in the deaths of four people. Sixty-eight people were arrested last night, only one of whom was actually from D.C., according to Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee. Of those arrests, 41 occurred on Capitol grounds. More than 50 U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. police officers sustained injuries during the attack on the Capitol, wrote Steven Sund, chief of U.S. Capitol Police. Sund described Wednesday's events as "criminal riotous behavior." "The violent attack on the U.S. Capitol was unlike any I have ever experienced in my 30 years in law enforcement here in Washington, D.C.," Sund said. Rioters attacked police with metal pipes, chemical irritants and other weapons, he said. The FBI asked the public on Thursday to help identify people who took part in the riots. Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen vowed Thursday that the Justice Department would ensure "those responsible for this attack on our Government and the rule of law face the full consequences of their actions under the law." Some participants in the riots will be charged today, Rosen said. "Our criminal prosecutors have been working throughout the evening with special agents and investigators from the U.S. Capitol Police, FBI, ATF, Metropolitan Police Department and the public to gather the evidence, identify perpetrators, and charge federal crimes where warranted," Rosen said. In a statement Thursday, Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary, Chad Wolf, called the events that unfolded at the U.S. Capitol "tragic and sickening." "Any appearance of inciting violence by an elected official goes against who we are as Americans. Every American is guaranteed the right to peacefully protest, but once those protests become violent, we should enforce our laws and bring those responsible to justice—regardless of political motivations," Wolf wrote. In a tweet Wednesday, Wolf wrote that those who engaged in the rioting should be held accountable. Trump withdrew Wolf's nomination Thursday to head Homeland Security just hours after he had urged the president to "strongly condemn the violence." Earlier Wednesday, the Department of Justice sent hundreds of federal law enforcement officers and agents from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the U.S. Marshals Service to help quell protests.

WASHINGTON – The White House fired the State Department official who said President Donald Trump was "entirely unfit to remain in office" following riots at the U.S. Capitol , a person familiar with the matter told NBC News. In a pair of tweets Wednesday, Gabriel Noronha said Trump "needs to go" after the president encouraged a mob to storm the U.S. Capitol. "President Trump fomented an insurrectionist mob that attacked the Capitol today. He continues to take every opportunity to obstruct the peaceful transfer of power," Noronha tweeted Wednesday night. "These actions threaten our democracy and our Republic. Trump is entirely unfit to remain in office, and needs to go." "All government officials swear to uphold and defend the Constitution. That is where our loyalties must lie - not to any man or political party," Noronha added. Noronha, who previously worked for Sen. Jim Inhofe and the late Sen. John McCain, served as a political appointee in the State department's Iran office for nearly two years. The White House and the State department did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as well as other members of Trump's Cabinet , condemned the violence that unfolded at the U.S. Capitol but stopped short of criticizing the president. "Lawlessness and rioting — here or around the world — is always unacceptable," the nation's top diplomat wrote on Twitter. "Let us swiftly bring justice to the criminals who engaged in this rioting," Pompeo wrote. "America is better than what we saw today." Earlier on Thursday, Trump withdrew his nomination of Chad Wolf to head the Department of Homeland Security , hours after Wolf, the acting Secretary, urged Trump to "strongly condemn the violence" at the U.S. Capitol. "This is unacceptable. These violent actions are unconscionable, and I implore the President and all elected officials to strongly condemn the violence that took place yesterday," acting secretary Wolf wrote in a statement Thursday. The White House denied that the withdrawal was linked to Wolf's response to the unrest.
The FBI said Friday that there was no indication that individuals associated with antifa disguised themselves among pro-Trump supporters in order to provoke the mob at the U.S. Capitol. Earlier this week, Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz, Mo Brooks and Paul Gosar had suggested that the left-wing extremist group tried to frame Trump supporters.	WASHINGTON — The FBI said Friday that there was no indication that individuals associated with antifa disguised themselves as pro-Trump supporters in order to provoke the mob at the U.S. Capitol, a claim repeated by several Republican lawmakers. When asked if the FBI had uncovered such efforts, Assistant Director Steven D'Antuono told reporters on a call, "We have no indication of that, at this time." Earlier this week, Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Paul Gosar of Arizona suggested that the left-wing extremist group tried to frame Trump supporters by intensifying the events that unfolded at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday after President Donald Trump's "Save America" rally. Hours after the crowd descended on the Capitol in an effort to derail congressional proceedings to tally electors' votes and confirm Biden's win in the Nov. 3 election, Gaetz told the House floor that he had read "compelling evidence" that some of the rioters were from antifa. "The Washington Times has just reported some pretty compelling evidence from a facial recognition company showing that some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and in fact were members of the violent terrorist group Antifa," Gaetz said. The Washington Times article has since been removed from the publication's website. In a four-part tweet on Thursday, Brooks wrote that "evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack." "Evidence, much public, surfacing that many Capitol assaulters were fascist ANTIFAs, not Trump supporters," Brooks wrote. Gosar wrote on Twitter on Wednesday that the attack on the U.S. Capitol had "all the hallmarks of Antifa provocation." The attack on the Capitol left five people dead, including Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick . The FBI asked the public on Thursday to help identify people who took part in the riots.
Vice President Mike Pence will attend the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 20, a person familiar told NBC News. Pence's decision to attend Biden's swearing-in ceremony at the U.S. Capitol is yet another public break with President Donald Trump.	WASHINGTON – Vice President Mike Pence will attend the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, a person familiar told NBC News. Pence's decision to watch Biden's swearing-in ceremony at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 20. is yet another public break with President Donald Trump since the riots that rocked Washington . On Friday, Trump said he would skip Biden's inauguration, a move that seemed to undercut the president's message of national " healing and reconciliation ," a day prior. Biden, who spoke from Wilmington, Delaware on Friday, welcomed Trump's decision , calling it "one of the few things we have ever agreed on." On the suggestion of Pence's potential attendance, Biden said he'd be "honored to have him there and to move forward in the transition." "I think it's important that as much as we can stick to what have been the historic precedents and circumstances of how an administration changes," Biden said. Traditionally, the incoming and outgoing presidents ride from the White House to the U.S. Capitol together for the inauguration ceremony. Trump is not the first outgoing president to skip the inauguration of his successor. The others were Presidents John Adams, John Quincy Adams and Andrew Johnson, according to the White House Historical Association. Like Trump, Johnson was also impeached. Ahead of the inauguration, which is in less than two weeks, more than 6,200 National Guard personnel will deploy to the nation's capital and remain in the region for at least 30 days. The mobilization ensures that the National Guard members will be on hand for Biden's inauguration at the Capitol.
Defense analytics firm Janes has identified the missile-like object, found last month in Indonesian waters, as the Chinese-built autonomous underwater glider Haiyi or "sea wing." It was the third identical underwater glider found in Indonesian waters within two years, said Kelvin Wong, Janes' principal unmanned systems analyst. Underwater gliders are typically used to conduct scientific research on the underwater environment, but the information can also be useful for naval operations, said Wong.	SINGAPORE — An underwater surveillance drone recovered deep inside Indonesian sovereign waters last month has been found to be of Chinese origins, according to defense analytics firm Janes. The "missile-like" object with wings has been identified as the Chinese-built autonomous underwater glider Haiyi or "sea wing," said Kelvin Wong, Janes' principal unmanned systems analyst, in a Sunday note. A local fisherman reportedly found the glider off Selayar Island in Indonesia's South Sulawesi province, before handing it over to the Indonesian navy. That's the third identical underwater glider found in Indonesian waters within two years, said Wong. It's not known where and why the drone was originally deployed, but the location where it was found is "disconnected from international waterways and extremely remote from China's adjacent maritime claims," said the analyst. There hasn't been any known Chinese scientific surveys in or around Indonesian waters that used those gliders in 2020, noted Wong. Underwater drones used in the last known operation in December 2019 were said to have all been successfully recovered, he said. Underwater gliders are typically used to conduct scientific research on the underwater environment, such as gathering data on chlorophyll and oxygen levels, as well as water temperature, said the analyst. Such data are also useful for naval operations, especially in submarine and anti-submarine warfare, he added. "Superior knowledge of a region's waters can enable submarines to operate more quietly and reduce the likelihood of discovery," said Wong. "Conversely, intimate knowledge of these underwater characteristics can aid (anti-submarine warfare) personnel in hunting potentially hostile submarines." China has a "clearly mandated Military-Civil Fusion policy" to use available knowledge and technologies in the civilian and commercial space for military advantages, explained Wong. As a result, the "dual-use nature" of the information gathered by underwater gliders "will likely be exploited by the Chinese military, he said. Wong pointed out that the latest underwater gliders found by Indonesian were near strategic waterways and chokepoints. It implies that data gathered may be used by China to enhance the ability of its submarines and surface combatants to operate in those waters, said the analyst.
The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on seven Kremlin-linked individuals and four entities for attempting to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Treasury targeted the inner circle of Andrii Derkach, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, who was sanctioned last year. Derkach has previously worked with Rudy Giuliani to dig up damaging information on President Donald Trump's Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter.	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Monday slapped sanctions on seven Kremlin-linked individuals and four entities for attempting to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. Treasury Department described the targeted sanctions as the "inner circle" of Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach, who was sanctioned last year . Derkach has previously worked with Rudy Giuliani to dig up damaging information on President Donald Trump's Democratic opponent, President-elect Joe Biden, and his son Hunter. "Since at least 2019, Derkach and his associates have leveraged U.S. media, U.S.-based social media platforms, and influential U.S. persons to spread misleading and unsubstantiated allegations that current and former U.S. officials engaged in corruption, money laundering, and unlawful political influence in Ukraine," Treasury wrote in a statement. Giuliani has acted as a personal lawyer for Trump, and his efforts to get Ukraine to launch an investigation into the Bidens led to Trump's impeachment over a year ago after the president withheld military aid to Ukraine while asking for such a probe. "Russian disinformation campaigns targeting American citizens are a threat to our democracy," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin wrote in a statement Monday without naming Biden or Trump. "The United States will continue to aggressively defend the integrity of our election systems and processes." In September, Treasury imposed sanctions on Derkach, describing him as an "active Russian agent for over a decade" with close connections to Russian intelligence services. "From at least late 2019 through mid-2020, Derkach waged a covert influence campaign centered on cultivating false and unsubstantiated narratives concerning U.S. officials in the upcoming 2020 presidential election," Treasury wrote in a statement at the time. Treasury sanctioned three former Ukrainian government officials, Konstantin Kulyk, Oleksandr Onyshchenko and Andriy Telizhenko, as well as Oleksandr Dubinsky, who is a current member of the Ukrainian parliament for publicly affiliating themselves with Derkach. Kulyk, a former prosecutor for the Ukrainian government, worked with Derkach to spread false accusations of international corruption, according to Treasury. Onyshchenko provided Derkach with edited audio recordings of purported conversations between former Ukrainian and U.S. officials. The recordings were later released by Derkach in order to discredit U.S. officials and the integrity of U.S. elections. Telizhenko, a former Ukrainian diplomat, orchestrated meetings between Derkach and U.S. individuals to discuss how to propagate false claims. Dubinsky, who serves alongside Derkach in Ukraine's parliament, has previously perpetuated "false narratives" that were designed to "denigrate U.S. presidential candidates and their families," according to Treasury. Treasury also sanctioned NabuLeaks, Era-Media TOV, Only News and Skeptik TOV, which were described as "media front companies in Ukraine that push false narratives at Derkach's behest." Treasury also took aim at Petro Zhuravel, Dmytro Kovalchuk and Anton Simonenk, who worked for Derkach.
Within the first week of 2021, Iran seized a South Korean tanker in the Strait of Hormuz and announced its return to 20% uranium enrichment, a massive breach of the 2015 nuclear deal it signed with world powers. A recent law passed by Iran's hawkish Parliament — over the objections of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's government — mandates that Iran ramp up its nuclear program on multiple fronts. The moves create an immediate challenge for the incoming Biden administration	 Iran came into 2021 swinging. Within the first week of the year, the country had seized a South Korean tanker in the Strait of Hormuz and announced its return to 20% uranium enrichment, a massive breach of the 2015 nuclear deal it signed with world powers. The tanker seizure, Iran says, is in response to South Korea holding $7 billion of its cash, frozen as a result of U.S. sanctions the Trump administration imposed on Iran after pulling out of the deal in 2018. South Korea's foreign minister arrived in Tehran on Sunday to discuss the tanker's release. The moves are sure to create a headache for the incoming Biden administration, whose top officials never wanted the nuclear deal — officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA — to be abandoned in the first place. Just how important is that 20% nuclear enrichment figure? For starters, 20% constitutes highly-enriched uranium and was the level at which Iran was enriching uranium between 2010 and 2013, before the JCPOA was agreed. Its activities led Iran to be hit with the toughest sanctions ever coordinated by the U.S. and EU together. Under the nuclear deal, by contrast, Iran was only allowed to enrich to 3.67% U-235. U-235 is the isotope of uranium that can sustain a fission chain reaction. "Iran appears to be trying to maximize its leverage with the Biden administration in the hope that the U.S. will agree to re-enter, rather than attempt to renegotiate, the JCPOA," Anne Harrington, professor of international relations and a specialist in nuclear non-proliferation at Cardiff University in Wales, told CNBC. A recent law passed by Iran's hawkish Parliament — over the objections of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's government — mandates that Iran ramp up its nuclear program on multiple fronts. Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, shared Harrington's prediction. "By upping the nuclear ante, Tehran is hoping to create a crisis, a crisis which it hopes the U.S. will defuse with premature sanctions relief." The minimum threshold for a crude nuclear weapon is 400kg of uranium enriched to 20% U-235 — but weapons grade uranium is 90% U-235, nuclear experts told CNBC. Still, they explained, reaching 3 to 4% enrichment equates to roughly two-thirds of the work done toward that 90% figure, as any increases beyond that amount disproportionately speed up breakout time. Iran's Atomic Energy Organization chief said last week that Iran also plans to stockpile 120kg of this 20% enriched uranium annually, as part of a target set by Parliament. And while Tehran currently still allows IAEA inspections of its nuclear sites, the new law mandates that the government halt the inspections by the U.N. watchdog by February if sanctions aren't lifted. "The fact that the more hawkish Iranian parliament is able to push through a law mandating that Iran expand its nuclear program on multiple fronts is worrying," Harrington said. "At its worst, this strategy could exacerbate tensions and result in a dangerous game of chicken." Iran has long argued that its nuclear development is only for peaceful purposes, and has defended its incremental breaches of the JCPOA's parameters since July 2019 as a response to U.S. sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy. The moves are "a marker of how comfortable the regime is with taking risks," said Ben Taleblu. "This is also a leverage-seeking exercise in advance of the upcoming political transition in Washington." Despite the aggressive nuclear ramp-up this month, "as Iranian Foriegn Minister Javad Zarif emphasized in remarks earlier this month, these actions are reversible," Harrington noted. "If the U.S. and Europe come back into compliance with the JCPOA, Iran will too." Still, everything could change when Iran votes to elect a new president in June. Biden has expressed his aim to return to some form of the 2015 deal; some of his top foreign policy picks were the original negotiators and architects of the deal. But Tehran is not likely to make it an easy return, demanding compensation for the economic damage it suffered under the last few years of sanctions and other U.S. concessions. "This is a double edged sword, both for the Iranians and the Biden administration," said Sanam Vakil, deputy head of Chatham House's MENA Program. The Iranians are wary of returning to the table too quickly, while for Biden, "the optics are quite difficult to justify giving in to the Islamic Republic and giving in to pressure tactics, particularly in light of the past criticism of the deal." By ramping up the leverage with the nuclear moves and the South Korean tanker seizure, "Iran wants to remind the international community, and particularly the Biden administration, that Iran doesn't only have the diplomatic path," Vakil said. "There is this impulse inside the country to use pressure to extract concessions."
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo canceled an official trip to Europe, which was to be the last of his tenure as the nation's top diplomat. Pompeo was slated to travel to Belgium on Wednesday to meet with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Belgian deputy prime minister Sophie Wilmes. The trip later this week included a stop in Luxembourg, according to a Reuters report. However, the entire trip was reportedly canceled when officials from Luxembourg and the European Union refused to meet with Pompeo.	WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo abruptly canceled a trip to Europe during his final week in office as the nation's top diplomat. The cancellation came after several European officials refused to meet with Pompeo, people familiar with the matter told Reuters . The snub from European officials comes one week after thousands of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, sending shockwaves around the world. Pompeo, in his last diplomatic mission, was slated to travel to Belgium on Wednesday to meet with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Belgian Deputy Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes. Stoltenberg and Wilmes publicly described the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol as "shocking." Other world leaders also condemned the riot in unusually stark terms. The trip later this week also reportedly included a stop in Luxembourg, according to Reuters. The State Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. State spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement Tuesday that the decision to cancel the trip was made so that Pompeo could continue working with President-elect Joe Biden's team on the transition. "We are fully committed to the completion of a smooth and orderly transition process to be finalized over the next 8 days. Both the Department and the President-elect's team have been fully engaged for several weeks toward this end, and we are pleased with the level of cooperation and professionalism that has been displayed," Ortagus wrote. Antony Blinken, Biden's pick to lead the State department , is expected to provide Pompeo's team with a list of career officials who will temporarily remain in acting positions until the Senate confirmation process is complete. Last week, Pompeo confirmed in a tweet that he met with Blinken and called the meeting "very productive." It was not immediately clear if the two discussed the deadly riot at the Capitol, which occurred just two days prior.
More than a dozen Democratic senators called on the Defense Department to launch an investigation into the prevalence of White supremacy in the military. The probe comes as thousands of National Guard service members protect Washington, D.C., in the wake of the deadly break-in at the U.S. Capitol by President Donald Trump's supporters. A U.S. Army officer involved in psychological operations, Capt. Emily Rainey, resigned Monday after commanders at Fort Bragg confirmed that they were reviewing her involvement in the riot.	The Pentagon's internal watchdog on Thursday announced an investigation into whether the military is doing enough to root out extremist and supremacist ideologies among active-duty personnel after last week's deadly mob attack on the U.S. Capitol. The probe, to be launched this month, comes as thousands of National Guard service members, some of them armed, protect Washington in the wake of the deadly riot by President Donald Trump's supporters on Jan. 6. The announcement followed the Defense Department's insistence that it is doing all it can to snuff out extremism in its ranks. Law enforcement authorities are preparing for potentially more violence ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration Wednesday. Officials fear that extremists are targeting statehouses around the country, as people online are attempting to organize pro-Trump rallies . The objective of the probe is "to determine the extent to which the [Department of Defense] and the Military Services have implemented policy and procedures that prohibit active advocacy and active participation related to supremacist, extremist, or criminal gang doctrine, ideology, or causes by active duty military personnel," Carolyn Hantz, the Pentagon's assistant inspector general for evaluations programs, said in a letter. Hantz noted that her office "may revise or expand the objective and scope as the evaluation proceeds, and we will consider suggestions from management for additional or revised objectives." Lawmakers of both parties have pushed for investigations into the assault on the Capitol and the response to it by law enforcement authorities. On Thursday afternoon, more than a dozen Democratic senators, led by Connecticut's Richard Blumenthal, called on the Defense Department to launch an investigation into the prevalence of White supremacy in the military. "The issue of white supremacy and extremist ideology within the ranks of our military is not new, but the attack on the Capitol makes clear this alarming trend must be immediately addressed," the senators wrote in a letter to the Pentagon's acting inspector general, Sean O'Donnell. The letter noted that numerous people who participated in the break-in, or who attended Trump's nearby rally that preceded the attack, have been identified as military veterans or active-duty service members. "The spread of white supremacist ideology is dangerous for the military and threatens to rupture civil-military safeguards that our democracy requires," the senators wrote. Gary Reed, director for intelligence at the Pentagon, wrote Wednesday: "We in the Department of Defense are doing everything we can to eliminate extremism in the Department of Defense. DoD policy expressly prohibits military personnel from actively advocating supremacist, extremist, or criminal gang doctrine, ideology or causes." On Monday, Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., called on acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller to investigate whether active-duty or retired military members took part in the deadly mob. If such individuals are identified by criminal investigators, Duckworth said, Miller must " take appropriate action to hold individuals accountable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice ." Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran who retired as a lieutenant colonel from the Army National Guard, said that "upholding good order and discipline demands that the U.S. Armed Forces root out extremists that infiltrate the military and threaten our national security." A U.S. Army officer involved in psychological operations, Capt. Emily Rainey, resigned Monday after commanders at Fort Bragg confirmed that they were reviewing her involvement in the riot . In a statement Tuesday, the Army said it is working with the FBI to determine whether any participants in last week's riot have any connection to the Army. "Any type of activity that involves violence, civil disobedience, or a breach of peace may be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or under state or federal law," an Army spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement. The probe by Defense's Office of Inspector General was revealed as the U.S. military presence in Washington swells to 20,000 National Guard members, a troop footprint that is four times larger than service members currently deployed in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan combined. A portion of these troops, who are tasked with supporting U.S. Capitol security and Biden's inauguration, will be armed. For security reasons, officials from the National Guard and the Pentagon would not elaborate on the exact number of troops that will be armed and if the troops will be armed after Inauguration Day. A senior Defense official said Thursday on a call with reporters that the National Guard members supporting the events in D.C. will undergo additional background checks. As military forces flood the nation's capital, the White House released a statement from Trump touting a reduction in troops abroad during his one term in office. "United States military troops in Afghanistan are at a 19-year low," said Trump, who campaigned in 2016 on stopping "ridiculous endless wars" in the Middle East. "Likewise, Iraq and Syria are also at the lowest point in many years. I will always be committed to stopping the endless wars." "It has been a great honor to rebuild our military and support our brave men and women in uniform," Trump said. The statement was sent as a press release from the White House. Trump, who often delivered messages of similar length on Twitter, was kicked off that platform following his initial response to the riots . The president falsely claimed at a rally outside the White House just before the siege began that the election was "stolen." He later condemned the rioters in a video message after a bipartisan House majority voted to impeach him for inciting an insurrection. "No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence," Trump said in the video Wednesday evening. Trump has maintained that his remarks were appropriate even though supporters walked straight from his rally to the Capitol to participate in the riot. Democrats are pushing for Trump to be convicted and removed in an upcoming Senate trial. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said no such trial could conclude before Trump leaves office, which means it will drag on into the early days of the Biden administration.
The Trump administration has added smartphone giant Xiaomi to a blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies. The move means that Xiaomi is now subject to a November executive order forcing U.S. investors to to divest, or sell out, of affected holdings of any companies on the blacklist, by Nov. 11 this year. Beijing-based Xiaomi was the world's third-largest smartphone maker in the third quarter of 2020, according to Counterpoint Research.	GUANGZHOU, China — The Trump administration has added smartphone maker Xiaomi to a blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies. Hong Kong-listed shares of the Chinese firm were down 10.6% at the open on Friday on that news. Beijing-based Xiaomi was the world's third-largest smartphone maker in the third quarter of 2020, according to Counterpoint Research. The move means that Xiaomi is now subject to a November executive order restricting American investors from buying shares or related securities of any companies designated by the Department of Defense to be a Chinese military company. Trump's initial executive order was subsequently expanded to force investors to divest, or sell out, of affected holdings, by Nov. 11 this year. The company is listed in Hong Kong and not in the U.S. "The Department is determined to highlight and counter the People's Republic of China's (PRC) Military-Civil Fusion development strategy, which supports the modernization goals of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise acquired and developed by even those PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian entities," the DOD said in a statement. Xiaomi is one of nine entities designated as "Communist Chinese military companies." Comac, a Chinese aircraft manufacturer, is also on the list. Xiaomi hit back at the U.S. on Friday and said it is not linked to China's military. "The Company reiterates that it provides products and services for civilian and commercial use. The Company confirms that it is not owned, controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military, and is not a 'Communist Chinese Military Company' defined under the NDAA," Xiaomi said. NDDA refers to the National Defense Authorization Act of 1999, the legislation which the U.S. used to designate Xiaomi as a Chinese military company. Xiaomi said it will "take appropriate course of actions to protect the interests of the Company and its shareholders." The DOD released its initial list of companies in June 2020. Firms such as Chinese technology giant Huawei and semiconductor manufacturer SMIC, are also on the list. "For Xiaomi, everything is now on the line," Abishur Prakash, a geopolitical specialist at the Center for Innovating the Future (CIF), a Toronto-based consulting firm, told CNBC by email. "By being blacklisted, it is now deemed a U.S. national security threat. This may affect its global strategy, from expanding into markets like India to hiring Western talent to launching new products in Africa." The final days of Trump's presidency has seen the administration ramp up pressure on the Chinese technology sector. On Thursday, the U.S. Commerce Department finalized rules that would prohibit certain transactions involving information and communications technology or services with countries Washington designates as a foreign adversary. China is on the list. President Donald Trump has used executive orders to target Chinese apps and companies such as Tencent's  WeChat . The administration has also used a blacklist called the Entity List to restrict American companies exporting technology to Chinese firms. This has hit Huawei in particular and saw the company cut off from Google's Android mobile operating system , hurting its smartphone sales in markets outside of China. Washington has also used export rules to cut Huawei off from key semiconductor supplies . To be clear, Xiaomi has not been put on the Entity List. It's unclear at this point if the military designation by the U.S. will affect the phone maker's ability to buy key components like semiconductors. Xiaomi's smartphones rely on chips from American company Qualcomm . "If Xiaomi is not on the Entity List yet and supplies continue unabated, then at least its operations can continue for now," Bryan Ma, vice president of devices research at IDC, said. "Still, this doesn't help its image, especially as it cozies up to more telcos and distributors around the world."
Trump may give final remarks as commander in chief during a farewell ceremony at Joint Base Andrews. Last week the president announced he will not attend the inauguration. Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence are expected to attend Joe Biden's inauguration.	WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump is expected to depart the White House for West Palm Beach, Florida, a few hours before his successor, President-elect Joe Biden , is sworn into office, two people familiar with the arrangements told NBC News. The people explained that Trump may give final remarks as commander in chief during a farewell ceremony at Joint Base Andrews, where Air Force One and its twin decoy are held. From Andrews, Trump will fly on Air Force One for the last time to Mar-a-Lago, his private resort. The White House declined to comment. Last week, Trump announced that he will not attend the inauguration , which Biden said was, "one of the few things he and I have ever agreed on." Trump is not the first outgoing president to skip the inauguration of his successor. The others were Presidents John Adams, John Quincy Adams and Andrew Johnson, according to the White House Historical Association. Like Trump, Johnson was also impeached. Trump's refusal to accept the election results culminated on Jan. 6, when swarms of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and derailed congressional proceedings to tally electors' votes and confirm Biden's win in the Nov. 3 contest. The House of Representatives on Wednesday impeached Trump for inciting insurrection in a bipartisan vote that included 10 Republicans. It's unclear when the Senate trial will take place. Trump is the only president in U.S. history to be impeached twice. He was first impeached in December 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in connection with his efforts to press the government of Ukraine to investigate the Biden family. Trump was later acquitted by the Senate. Biden's victory was projected by all major news outlets in mid-November and confirmed by Electoral College votes in mid-December. The Republican president has falsely insisted that he won in a "landslide" and that the presidency was stolen from him. Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence are expected to attend Biden's inauguration. The Obamas, Clintons as well as former President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush will be at the inauguration. Former President Jimmy Carter will not attend due to Covid and health conditions, according to a spokesperson. Carter, the oldest living president at 96, and former first lady Rosalyn Carter were at the Obama and Trump inaugurations. Trump's decision not to attend Biden's inauguration came one day after he finally conceded the presidential election . Without mentioning Biden by name, he acknowledged "a new administration will be inaugurated on Jan. 20" in a nearly three-minute video. "My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power," the president said in his first video statement after the riot. "Now tempers must be cooled, and calm restored. We must get on with the business of America," Trump said of the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol . The violence left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer.  The National Guard has moved 20,000 troops to D.C. to help secure the U.S. Capitol and Biden's inauguration after last week's violence. The troop footprint at the nation's capital is more than the number of U.S. service members in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan combined.
President-elect Joe Biden's incoming national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, called for Russian authorities to immediately release Alexei Navalny. Navalny, a top opposition leader, was detained in Moscow after returning to Russia from Berlin. Sullivan's call for Navalny's release comes days before Biden is sworn into office. In the wake of Navalny's poisoning last year, Biden vowed "to work with our allies and partners to hold the Putin regime accountable for its crimes."	WASHINGTON – President-elect Joe Biden's national security advisor Jake Sullivan called for the immediate release of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was detained Sunday upon arrival at an airport in Moscow . Earlier on Sunday, Navalny flew to Russia from Berlin, Germany where he had spent nearly half a year recovering since he was poisoned last summer. He was arrested at passport control. Last week, Russian authorities issued a warrant for Navalny's arrest, claiming that he had violated the terms of a suspended three-and-a-half year sentence he received back in 2014 for embezzlement charges. "Mr. Navalny should be immediately released, and the perpetrators of the outrageous attack on his life must be held accountable," Sullivan wrote on Twitter. The White House and Department of State did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Sullivan's call for Navalny's release comes days before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn into office. Biden's incoming administration is expected to increase pressure on Russia. In the wake of Navalny's poisoning last year, Biden vowed "to work with our allies and partners to hold the Putin regime accountable for its crimes," and he accused President Donald Trump of not taking a tough enough stance. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators had called on the Trump administration to impose sanctions on Russia in response to Navalny's poisoning. Trump, who leaves office Wednesday, has not done so.  The United Kingdom and the European Union, close U.S. allies, moved swiftly to impose targeted sanctions on six Russians and a state research center in October. Aboard the flight back to Moscow, Navalny told reporters that he felt great and that making the journey home has been "the best moment in the last five months." "I feel great. Finally, I'm returning to my home town," he said, according to a Reuters report. Last year, Navalny was medically evacuated to Germany from a Russian hospital after he became ill following reports that something was added to his tea. Russian doctors treating Navalny denied that the Kremlin critic had been poisoned and blamed his comatose state on low blood sugar levels. In September, the German government said that the 44-year-old Russian dissident was poisoned by a chemical nerve agent, describing the toxicology report as providing " unequivocal evidence ." The nerve agent was in the family Novichok, which was developed by the Soviet Union.  On the heels of the test results, the White House said it was "deeply troubled" by the matter and called the poisoning "completely reprehensible." "The United States is deeply troubled by the results released today," White House National Security Council spokesperson John Ullyot said in a written statement at the time. "Alexei Navalny's poisoning is completely reprehensible. Russia has used the chemical nerve agent Novichok in the past," he said, referencing the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England in 2018 . The Kremlin has repeatedly denied a role in the poisoning of Navalny and Skripal's. Navalny's arrest Sunday is poised to further strain relations between European leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin and comes as the Kremlin works to secure a gas pipeline project, Nord Stream 2 , to Germany.
President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday delivered an emotional tribute to his longtime home and his late son, Beau Biden. Biden is set to be sworn in as president on Wednesday. Biden is scheduled to deliver additional remarks later Tuesday at the Lincoln Memorial in a ceremony honoring the victims of the coronavirus.	Before departing Delaware for his inauguration in Washington, President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday delivered an emotional paean to his longtime home and his late son Beau Biden. The elder Biden, who is set to take office Wednesday, choked up at the top of his brief remarks at Delaware National Guard headquarters in New Castle, which was named after Beau in 2016 following his death a year earlier at age 46. "It's kind of emotional for me," Biden said, wiping tears from his eyes before praising Delaware as "the state that loves our children and our grandchildren, and loved our Beau, and he so loved you right back." "It's deeply personal that our next journey to Washington starts here, a place that defines the very best of who we are as Americans," Biden said. "I know these are dark times, but there's always light. That's what makes this state so special. That's what it taught me," Biden said. Biden, since defeating President Donald Trump 's bid for reelection, had largely been based near Wilmington, where his transition team was headquartered. From that location, Biden and his team have laid out a series of sweeping policy goals mainly aimed at defeating the coronavirus and restoring the health of an economy damaged by the pandemic. Biden is scheduled to deliver additional remarks later Tuesday at the Lincoln Memorial in a ceremony honoring the victims of Covid, which has killed at least 400,000 people in the U.S. The pandemic, and the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump, have prompted officials to make drastic changes to the inauguration ceremony, which traditionally draws thousands of spectators to the National Mall. This time, swaths of the National Mall have been closed to the public and roughly 25,000 National Guard members have been deployed to D.C. Toward the end of his remarks in New Castle, Biden again appeared overcome by his emotions. "James Joyce is said to have told a friend, that when it comes his time to pass, when he dies, he said, 'Dublin will be written on my heart.' Well — excuse the emotion," Biden said, his voice cracking. After a pause, Biden said: "When I die, Delaware will be written on my heart. The hearts of all the Bidens. We love you all. You've been there for us in the good and the bad. You never walked away." "I am even more proud to be standing here, doing this from the Major Beau Biden facility," Biden added. "Ladies and gentlemen, I only have one regret: that he's not here, because we should be introducing him as president." Correction: Biden is scheduled to deliver additional remarks later Tuesday at the Lincoln Memorial in a ceremony honoring the victims of Covid. An earlier version misstated the day.
The Chinese government slapped sanctions on former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former national security advisor Robert O'Brien and former trade advisor Peter Navarro, along with other members of the Trump administration Wednesday. "China has decided to sanction 28 persons who have seriously violated China's sovereignty and who have been mainly responsible for such U.S. moves on China-related issues," wrote the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement. The crumbling relationship between Washington and Beijing intensified under the Trump administration.	WASHINGTON – The Chinese government on Wednesday slapped sanctions on former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former national security advisor Robert O'Brien and former trade advisor Peter Navarro, along with other members of the Trump administration. The move came after Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States. "Over the past few years, some anti-China politicians in the United States, out of their selfish political interests and prejudice and hatred against China and showing no regard for the interests of the Chinese and American people, have planned, promoted and executed a series of crazy moves which have gravely interfered in China's internal affairs, undermined China's interests, offended the Chinese people, and seriously disrupted China-U.S. relations," wrote the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement. "China has decided to sanction 28 persons who have seriously violated China's sovereignty and who have been mainly responsible for such U.S. moves on China-related issues," the statement also said. The Chinese government also named former deputy national security advisor Matthew Pottinger, former Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs David Stilwell and Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment Keith Krach. Former national security advisor John Bolton and former Trump advisor Steve Bannon were also sanctioned Wednesday. "These individuals and their immediate family members are prohibited from entering the mainland, Hong Kong and Macao of China. They and companies and institutions associated with them are also restricted from doing business with China," wrote the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement. The crumbling relationship between Washington and Beijing intensified under the Trump administration following an attempt by the world's two largest economies to mend trade relations. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying has previously said the Trump administration " is pressing the accelerator to trash China-U.S. relations ." "Certain U.S. politicians are so irresponsible that they will say whatever needs to be said to make China a target," she added last summer. Her comments followed a blistering speech by then-U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr in which he accused the Chinese government of human rights abuses, espionage and economic blitzkrieg. "The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg—an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower," Barr said during a July 16 speech. In June, O'Brien slammed China for a laundry list of offenses before saying that "the days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over." Pompeo has previously described Huawei and other Chinese state-backed businesses as " Trojan horses for Chinese intelligence ." In July, Pompeo announced that the U.S. was looking at banning TikTok as well as other Chinese social media apps , citing national security concerns. The Trump administration also squarely placed blame on China for the deadly health crisis caused by the coronavirus .
The Senate confirmed Avril Haines as the director of national intelligence Wednesday, the first official member of President Joe Biden's Cabinet. Haines will lead the nation's 18 intelligence agencies and is the first woman to hold the position.	WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Avril Haines as the director of national intelligence Wednesday evening, making her the first official member of President Joe Biden's Cabinet. Before adjourning for the evening, the Senate voted 84 to 10 on Haines' confirmation. Haines, Biden's pick to lead the nation's 18 intelligence agencies, is the first woman to hold the position. "Our adversaries will not stand by and wait for the new administration to staff critical positions, and I am pleased my Senate colleagues joined me in swiftly confirming Director Haines to this important post," Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., acting chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, wrote in a statement. "Avril Haines was the right choice for Director of National Intelligence," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a statement Wednesday evening. "We appreciate the bipartisan cooperation to get her confirmed tonight, and we hope there will be a lot more of it because the nation is in crisis and we need President Biden's team in place as quickly as possible," he added. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday evening in her first briefing that assembling Biden's Cabinet and his national security team is paramount. On Tuesday, Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee, which voted on her nomination, that one of her main initiatives will be to instill trust in the nation's intelligence agencies. "The DNI must never shy away from speaking truth to power — even, especially, when doing so may be inconvenient or difficult," Haines said. "The DNI must insist that, when it comes to intelligence, there is simply no place for politics — ever." Before joining the Biden administration, Haines served as former President Barack Obama's deputy national security advisor. She also previously served as deputy CIA director. She is the first woman to hold both of those positions.
U.S. President Joe Biden is a "strong supporter" of NATO, and the alliance can be further strengthened with him in office, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said this week. Citing global challenges such as the constant threat of terrorist attacks, Stoltenberg said "none of us can tackle this alone, we have to stand together." He also weighed in on the drawdown of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and Iraq.	U.S. President Joe Biden is a "strong supporter" of NATO, and the alliance can be further strengthened with him in office, NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said this week. "President Biden and the inauguration of him as the new president represents a new chapter for our alliance because Joe Biden is such a strong supporter of NATO. He knows NATO very well," the NATO chief told CNBC's Hadley Gamble on Thursday. This will be an opportunity to further strengthen NATO, he added, noting that Biden wants to rebuild alliances. U.S. commitment to NATO reached a low point under former President Donald Trump. He repeatedly attacked allies for paying less than their fair share toward the group. Stoltenberg said he looks forward to working with the new administration to address issues around the world. "We are faced with so many challenges at the same time: the rise of China, the … shift in the global balance of power, a more assertive Russia using force against neighbors in Ukraine and elsewhere, and then, of course, the constant threat of terrorist attacks," he said. "None of us can tackle this alone, we have to stand together," he said. "I don't believe in America alone, I don't believe in Europe alone, I believe in Europe and North America together in NATO." Separately, Stoltenberg weighed in on the drawdown of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and Iraq. "We should be careful [about] not leaving too early," he said. "At the same time, no one wants to stay in Afghanistan or Iraq longer than necessary." The Pentagon last week announced that the number of U.S. troops in both countries has been reduced to 2,500, as directed by Trump when he was president. His administration signed an agreement with the Taliban in February that aims for a permanent ceasefire in Afghanistan and would reduce American military presence in the country. NATO also has personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq. Stoltenberg said NATO is in close consultation with the new U.S. administration. "We will face a difficult dilemma," he said. Leaving would risk losing the gains made in Afghanistan in fighting international terrorism and making social progress, but staying means continued involvement in a "difficult military conflict." "What matters for me is that we make decisions together, that we are coordinating everything we do in Afghanistan," he said. NATO plans to expand its presence in Iraq, Stoltenberg added. "I strongly believe that the best way we can help to prevent ISIS terrorists from returning is by training the Iraqi forces, help them to fight the terrorists themselves," he said. — CNBC's Matt Clinch contributed to this report.
The Senate confirmed Lloyd Austin as the next Pentagon chief Friday, making him the nation's first Black Defense secretary. Austin's confirmation follows Wednesday's Senate confirmation of Avril Haines, who became the first woman to the lead nation's 18 intelligence agencies as the director of national intelligence. In back-to-back votes Thursday, the House and Senate passed legislation granting Austin a waiver to lead the Pentagon.	WASHINGTON – The Senate confirmed Lloyd Austin as the next Pentagon chief Friday, making him the nation's first Black Defense secretary. The Senate voted 93 to 2 to confirm Austin. Austin's confirmation follows Wednesday's Senate confirmation of Avril Haines , who became the first woman to the lead nation's 18 intelligence agencies as the director of national intelligence. In back-to-back votes Thursday, the House and Senate passed legislation granting Austin, a retired four-star Army general, a waiver to lead the Pentagon. The Senate approved Austin's waiver by a vote of 69-27 and the House approved the waiver by a vote of 326 to 78. Under the National Security Act of 1947 , Congress has prohibited any individual from serving as secretary of Defense within seven years of active-duty service. Austin left the Army in 2016 and therefore required a special congressional waiver in order to bypass the seven-year rule. Former President Donald Trump's first Defense secretary, James Mattis, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, also needed the same waiver from Congress. Before becoming the 28th secretary of Defense, Austin served as a board member at defense giant Raytheon . Trump's former Pentagon chiefs Mattis, Mark Esper and acting secretary of defense Patrick Shanahan also had ties to defense titans General Dynamics , Raytheon and Boeing . The 1975 graduate of West Point would be the first Black leader of the Pentagon, breaking one of the more enduring barriers in the U.S. government.
President Biden signed an executive order reversing his predecessor's ban on transgender people enlisting in the U.S. military. Currently, transgender troops are allowed to serve openly in the U.S. military only if they were covered by the 2016 policy carried out by Obama Defense Secretary Ash Carter.	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden signed an executive order Monday reversing former President Donald Trump's ban on transgender people enlisting in the U.S. military. The repeal, a Biden campaign promise, allows the Pentagon to revoke regulations that limit how transgender troops can serve in the military. Currently, transgender troops are allowed to serve openly in the U.S. military only if they were covered by the 2016 policy carried out by Obama Defense Secretary Ash Carter. In 2017, Trump tweeted that he would no longer allow "transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military." Trump's first Defense secretary, James Mattis, issued a compromise that grandfathered in some service members but required that new recruits serve in their original birth gender. "President Biden believes that gender identity should not be a bar to military service, and that America's strength is found in its diversity," the White House said. Biden's Defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, has backed the move. "I support the president's plan or plan to overturn the ban," Austin told lawmakers last week at his Senate confirmation hearing. "I truly believe that if you're fit and you're qualified to serve and you can maintain the standards, you should be allowed to serve. And you can expect that I will support that throughout," Austin said. The Senate confirmed Austin on Friday. Biden has nominated Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine to serve as assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. If confirmed by the Senate, Levine would be the first-ever Senate-confirmed transgender official in U.S. history.
Antony Blinken, the newly confirmed secretary of State, spoke on the phone with leaders from Mexico, Canada, Japan and South Korea. Blinken, a veteran diplomat, told lawmakers last week that he would focus on reengaging with America's allies in the wake of the Trump administration's "America First" foreign policy.	In his first handful of hours on the job, the nation's new secretary of State spoke to several of America's closest allies. Antony Blinken, who was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday , spoke to his counterparts from Mexico, Canada, Japan and South Korea. Blinken, a veteran diplomat, told lawmakers during his confirmation hearings last week that he would focus on reengaging with America's allies in the wake of the Trump administration's "America First" foreign policy. President Joe Biden is seeking to reset the nation's relationship with its allies. The nation's top diplomat spoke with Mexico Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard, emphasizing "our shared interest in security and economic integration, as well as our focus on an orderly and humane approach to migration," according to a statement from State spokesperson Ned Price. Mexico is the United States' second largest trading partner and second-largest export market. Under the Trump administration, the U.S. renegotiated the 24-year old North American Trade Agreement into what is now the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA which supports mutually beneficial trade leading to freer markets, fairer trade, and robust economic growth in North America. In his conversation with Canada Foreign Minister Marc Garneau, the two discussed how to "strengthen the broader North American partnership and to address shared challenges, including COVID-19 and climate change, among many others," the statement read. The U.S. and Canada maintain a working relationship which includes defense arrangements, upholding security standards and economic competitiveness that sees $2 billion goods and services traded a day. Meanwhile, Blinken and South Korea Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha "affirmed the enduring strength and importance of the U.S.-ROK Alliance, the linchpin of peace, security, and prosperity for a free and open Indo-Pacific region." South Korea donated over 2 million masks and facilitated nearly 750,000 Covid-19 tests to the U.S. After Biden's Inauguration, South Korea's president tweeted congratulations: North Korea remains a key source of tension in the region. Biden said at a debate during the campaign he will only meet with Kim Jong Un if the country scales back its nuclear arsenal. Blinken's communication with Japan Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi followed a similar thread, highlighting the need for a free and open trade in the Indo-Pacific region. Blinken was slated to hold his first press briefing from the State Department later Wednesday.
The pause and review itself are nothing unusual. But the arms sales in question are historic: they would represent the most advanced and most classified American weapons systems ever sold to Arab allies. Analysts interviewed by CNBC note that while Washington's relationship with the UAE isn't likely to see significant changes, the one with the Saudis probably will.	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The administration of President Joe Biden is pausing weapons sales to Gulf allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as part of a broader review of multibillion-dollar arms agreements made under the Trump administration. Biden's newly confirmed Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the review — which is common for new administrations — as being conducted "to make sure that what is being considered is something that advances our strategic objectives, and advances our foreign policy." The pause and review itself are nothing unusual. But the arms sales in question are historic: they would represent the most advanced and most classified American weapons systems ever sold to Arab allies. In the past, lethal drones and the flagship F-35 joint strike fighter jet were off the table for Arab allies in the Middle East because of Washington's commitment to maintaining Israel's advantageous qualitative military edge, or QME, in the region — a policy that has been codified in U.S. law for decades. But since the signing of the Abraham Accords in August normalizing relations between the UAE and Israel, acquiring these systems became a real possibility for the Emiratis. This is still not the case with Saudi Arabia, which has not normalized relations with Israel, but its pending purchase in the broader arms deal includes billions of dollars' worth of precision-guided munitions. Analysts interviewed by CNBC note that while Washington's relationship with the UAE isn't likely to see significant changes, the one with the Saudis probably will. "It's not going to be everybody gets to do whatever they want. The relationship is going to go back to strategic and values-based, which we haven't done in four years," a former senior Obama administration official familiar with Biden's thinking told CNBC. "It's not going to be a good relationship between the U.S. and Saudi without some significant changes," the former official said, speaking anonymously due to professional restrictions. The relationship with the kingdom during former President Donald Trump 's tenure has been described by many observers as "permissive." The White House did not pursue penalties against Riyadh for its role, as reported by U.S. intelligence agencies, in the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018. It also made little mention of its widely reported human rights abuses, which include jailing and allegedly torturing several female Saudi activists. When a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers voted to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, Trump vetoed them. And in May of 2019, Trump declared a "national emergency" over tensions with Iran in order to bypass congressional approval procedures to push through an $8 billion weapons sale to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan. Things are going to be different now, according to the former official. "He (Biden) doesn't want a negative relationship with Saudi Arabia, he wants them to pay the price. Change your behavior," he said. "At the end of the day we hold the cards, not them." Indeed, Biden in an early 2020 presidential debate promised to make Saudi Arabia "the pariah that they are." The Saudi Foreign Ministry and the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment on the weapons sale pause or Biden's "pariah" comment. Riyadh congratulated Biden on his presidential win, but not until more than 24 hours had passed since his victory was declared. Jessica Leyland, a senior intelligence analyst at London-based risk consultancy firm AKE International, underlined the changes Biden is expected to bring in. "President Trump proved a steadfast partner to Mohammed bin Salman, but the Crown Prince now faces a Biden administration which will judge the Kingdom on its human rights record, the conflict in Yemen and MbS's arbitrary detentions of princes," she wrote in a report released on Sunday. In addition to the Biden administration's new apparent focus on values, the current pause in weapons sales also has a crucial security angle, says Bradley Bowman, the senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "There are some things to balance here from an American perspective. We don't want the most advanced fighter in the world, and the technologies associated with it, to be leaking to Beijing or Moscow," he told CNBC's "Capital Connection" on Tuesday. But he stressed the divergence between Washington's relationships with the UAE and with Saudi Arabia. "I think robust arms sales will continue to the UAE, we'll have to watch the F-35 closely — but I think Saudi Arabia is in for some real tough sledding, particularly because of their activities in Yemen," he said. The UAE's embassy to the U.S. on Wednesday conveyed on Twitter that they fully expected the pause. "As in previous administrations, the UAE anticipated a review of current policies by the new administration," it wrote.
The U.S. may not be able to de-escalate troop presence in Afghanistan, due to the Taliban's refusal to meet terms agreed upon in the U.S.-Taliban peace deal, the new Pentagon press secretary said. Last year, the United States brokered a deal with the Taliban that would usher in a permanent cease-fire and reduce the U.S. military's footprint in Afghanistan.	WASHINGTON — The Pentagon said Thursday that the U.S. troop drawdown in Afghanistan would be contingent on the Taliban's commitments to uphold a peace deal brokered last year. "The Taliban have not met their commitments," Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters during a press briefing. He added that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was reviewing the matter and had discussed the path forward in the war-torn country with NATO allies and partners. "It is under discussion with our partners and allies to make the best decisions going forward on our force presence in Afghanistan," Kirby said, adding that the Biden administration has not made a determination. The United States brokered a deal with the Taliban last February that would usher in a permanent cease-fire and reduce the U.S. military's footprint from approximately 13,000 to 8,600 by mid-July last year. By May 2021, all foreign forces would leave the war-torn country, according to the deal. Former President Donald Trump, who campaigned in 2016 on stopping "ridiculous endless wars" in the Middle East, accelerated the reduction of U.S. troops in November. Then-acting Pentagon chief Christopher Miller announced that the Trump administration would drop its military presence in Afghanistan to 2,500 troops and in Iraq to 2,500 troops by Jan. 15. "This decision by the president is based on continuous engagement with his national security cabinet over the past several months including ongoing discussions with me and my colleagues across the United States government," Miller said at the Pentagon. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that leaving Afghanistan too soon or in an uncoordinated effort could present unintended consequences for the world's largest military organization. "Afghanistan risks becoming once again a platform for international terrorists to plan and organize attacks on our homelands. And ISIS could rebuild in Afghanistan the terror caliphate it lost in Syria and Iraq," the NATO chief said, referring to Islamic State militants. NATO joined the international security effort in Afghanistan in 2003 and currently has more than 7,000 troops in the country. NATO's security operation in Afghanistan was launched after the alliance activated its mutual defense clause — known as Article 5 — for the first time in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. There are approximately 2,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria have cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1.57 trillion since Sept. 11, 2001, according to a Defense Department report . The war in Afghanistan, which has dragged on to become America's longest conflict, began 19 years ago and has cost U.S. taxpayers $193 billion, according to the Pentagon . Among the addressed issues in the deal that leave the U.S. presence up in the air are the introduction of intra-Afghan negotiations and the guarantee that Afghanistan won't again become a refuge for terrorists. "The secretary has been very clear, and President Biden has too, it's time to end this war, but we want to do it responsibly, we want to do it in keeping with our national security interests and those of our Afghan partners," Kirby told reporters at the Pentagon. — CNBC's Christian Nunley contributed to this report from Virginia.
Secretary of State Anthony Blinken condemned Russia's use of "harsh tactics" against peaceful protesters who urge for the release of Putin opposition leader Alexei Navalny. More than 4,500 people were detained by Russian authorities for participating in the protests, according to a monitoring group. "It remains striking to me, how concerned, and maybe even scared, the Russian government seems to be of one man, Mr. Navalny," Blinken said last week.	WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has condemned the "persistent use of harsh tactics" by Russian authorities on peaceful protesters who took to the streets across Russia on Sunday to call for the release of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. For the second weekend in a row, tens of thousands rallied across the country in an effort to raise awareness for Navalny, a vocal critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was detained earlier this month by authorities. More than 4,500 people were detained by Russian authorities for participating in the protests, according to a monitoring group. "We renew our call for Russia to release those detained for exercising their human rights, including Aleksey Navalny," Blinken wrote in a tweet. Last year, Navalny was medically evacuated to Germany from a Russian hospital after he became ill following reports that something was added to his tea. Russian doctors treating Navalny denied that the Kremlin critic had been poisoned and blamed his comatose state on low blood sugar levels. In September, the German government said that the 44-year-old Russian dissident was poisoned by a chemical nerve agent, describing the toxicology report as providing " unequivocal evidence. " The nerve agent was in the family of Novichok, which was developed by the Soviet Union . The Kremlin has repeatedly denied having a role in Navalny's poisoning. Earlier this month, Navalny flew to Russia from Berlin, Germany where he had spent nearly half a year recovering since he was poisoned last summer. He was arrested at passport control. Russian authorities had issued a warrant for Navalny's arrest, claiming that he had violated the terms of a suspended three-and-a-half year sentence he received back in 2014 for embezzlement charges. "Mr. Navalny should be immediately released, and the perpetrators of the outrageous attack on his life must be held accountable," Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, wrote on Twitter on the heels of the arrest. Last week, Blinken expressed "deep concern" over the treatment of Navalny and the broader human rights situation in Russia. "It remains striking to me, how concerned, and maybe even scared, the Russian government seems to be of one man, Mr. Navalny," Blinken told reporters during a press briefing on Wednesday. "Across the board, as the president has said, we're reviewing all of these actions that are a deep concern to us whether it is the treatment of Mr. Navalny and particularly the apparent use of a chemical weapon in an attempt to assassinate him," the nation's top diplomat added. Blinken also said Wednesday that the Biden administration was reviewing the hack on SolarWinds , reports of bounties placed by Russia on American forces in Afghanistan, and potential election interference. Biden has previously vowed "to work with our allies and partners to hold the Putin regime accountable for its crimes ." He has also previously accused the Trump administration of not taking a tough enough stance on Moscow.
President Biden's brother, Frank Biden, worked with a consulting firm that was involved with federal lobbying on behalf of an oil distribution company during the last year of the Obama administration. The consulting company, Delmarva Group, turned to a lobbying shop in 2016 to represent Maryland-based Chesapeake Petroleum and Supply in targeting congressional lawmakers and the Defense Department. According to his LinkedIn page, Frank Biden served as a "member director" of Delmarva Group starting in 2015. "I provided advice and counsel based on my business experience. I had very limited engagement with Delmarva," Frank Biden told CNBC.	President Joe Biden 's younger brother Frank Biden worked with a small consulting firm that was involved with federal lobbying on behalf of an oil distribution company, during the last year of the Obama administration. The consulting company, little-known Delmarva Group, turned to the lobbying shop Cassidy & Associates to represent Maryland-based Chesapeake Petroleum and Supply in targeting congressional lawmakers and the Defense Department in 2016, as Joe Biden was in the final months of his second term as vice president. The development marks the latest instance of how Frank Biden's business ties sometimes have coincided with his older brother's time in office. Last week, CNBC reported that Frank Biden touted his relationship with his brother, and their shared commitment to environmental issues, in a law firm's newspaper ad that ran on Inauguration Day . That revelation drew a rebuke from the White House, as Joe Biden has sought to limit ties between his administration and his family's business dealings. "The president's name should not be used in connection with any commercial activities to suggest, or in any way that could reasonably understood to imply, his endorsement or support," a White House official told CNBC. White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated the administration's position at a news conference last week. According to his LinkedIn page, Frank Biden served as a "member director" of Delmarva Group starting in 2015. Joseph Abruzzo, a former member of the Florida Legislature and an owner of the now-defunct company, said Monday that Frank Biden didn't have a formal position with the firm until after Joe Biden was out of office. "I provided advice and counsel based on my business experience. I had very limited engagement with Delmarva," Frank Biden told CNBC on Monday. Abruzzo told CNBC that he and Frank Biden started planning for Delmarva in 2015. "Frank Biden and I began planning the business in 2015 and had discussions through 2016," Abruzzo said. "The structural formation and Frank's formal involvement began in 2017." CNBC reviewed several documents, including public records and lobbying disclosure reports, as well as Abruzzo's financial disclosure reports, to identify the links between Delmarva Group, Cassidy and Chesapeake Petroleum. The lobbying registration report and subsequent quarterly documents list "Delmarva Group on behalf of Chesapeake Petroleum" as the client. The Florida address listed on the lobbying reports matches the location on Delmarva's state disclosures. Delmarva is known to be a reference to the mid-Atlantic peninsula that includes Delaware, which Joe Biden represented for over three decades in the Senate, as well as parts of Maryland and Virginia. Frank Biden previously told CNBC that he "will never be employed by any lobbyist or lobbying firm." Indeed, there is no evidence that Biden was involved with the lobbying effort for Chesapeake. Frank Biden has another LinkedIn page that only highlights his work with the Berman Law Group, the Florida law firm that bought the Jan. 20 ad touting the younger Biden's work as an advisor. Abruzzo, in a lengthy statement, said that Frank Biden was not involved in any matters related to the Delmarva-Cassidy lobbying effort. "Frank Biden was not involved in any meetings or discussions or procurement related to Cassidy and Associates or federal lobbying efforts by Cassidy and Associates on behalf of Chesapeake Petroleum and Supply in 2016," Abruzzo said. "Frank Biden never attended a meeting with Cassidy and Associates or any government agency or official, nor did he communicate in any manner with a government agency or official in 2016 or any other subsequent year on behalf of Chesapeake Petroleum and Supply Co. There was never any federal government business obtained or procured with or through Delmarva Group, LLC. To Delmarva Group's knowledge, Chesapeake Petroleum and Supply Co. decided not to move forward with expanding their federal government practice." He did not say what Biden did for Delmarva. Abruzzo added that Delmarva became inactive in 2018 and closed in January 2020. The Iowa caucuses, the first-in-the-nation nominating contest of the Democratic primary, were held Feb. 3 that year. In an email, Frank Biden said "Joe is absolutely accurate," referring to Abruzzo's statement. Under the Delmarva heading, Frank Biden's LinkedIn page says the company acted as "Strategic consultants at point of sale. Alternative Energy and Environmental solutions." Chesapeake Petroleum is "an oil distributing company that has served the metropolitan DC area for over 45 years," according to oil industry website Oil Monster . The website adds that Chesapeake "specializes in passenger car motor oils and carries highly recognizable brands such a Mobil, Castrol, Motorcraft, Mopar and Exxon." Chesapeake Petroleum did not return a request for comment. Abruzzo's financial disclosures, which he filed as a member of the Florida Legislature, show he owned 50% of Delmarva. He is listed on the businesses' state filings as the company manager. In 2019, months before Delmarva filed the paperwork to dissolve, Biden's campaign released its clean energy proposal. In it, Biden pledges that his campaign would not take money from oil, gas and coal corporations or executives. Biden's plan says he will require "aggressive methane pollution limits for new and existing oil and gas operations," the campaign's proposal says. Biden recently canceled the permit for the Keystone Pipeline, an oil pipeline between the United States and Canada. A lobbying registration report shows that Delmarva, on behalf of Chesapeake Petroleum, was a client of Cassidy's, the lobbying firm. Vernon Simmons, who is now a senior vice president at Cassidy, registered to lobby for Delmarva in April 2016, the registration form says. The focus, according to the document, was to "support wholesale lubricants and automotive supply distributor, market products to federal customers." The address on the registration form matches the address on Delmarva's state filings. Simmons did not return a request for comment. The second-quarter 2016 lobbying report shows that, between April and June, Simmons targeted members of the House of Representatives and Senate to "promote direct sales of lubricant products & vehicle supplement equipment in DoD [Department of Defense]" for the Delmarva Group on behalf of Chesapeake Partners. In the third quarter of 2016, a lobbying report shows Simmons lobbied the Department of Defense and Congress for the same cause. Cassidy was paid $40,000 for its lobbying efforts, the records show. It is not clear how much Chesapeake paid Delmarva for consulting services, or whether Chesapeake or Delmarva paid Cassidy.
The Senate confirmed Alejandro Mayorkas to lead the Department of Homeland Security. He is the first Latino and first foreign-born person to run the department. Mayorkas has previously served as deputy secretary at DHS under former President Barack Obama.	WASHINGTON – The Senate confirmed Alejandro Mayorkas on Tuesday to lead the nation's Department of Homeland Security, making him the first Latino to hold the role. The Senate voted 56 to 43. His ascension to the agency's top role comes less than four weeks after supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol and as the nation struggles to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The agency, which was created on the heels of the 9/11 attacks, oversees border security, immigration enforcement, cybersecurity and disaster relief. Mayorkas' confirmation was stalled last week when some Republicans argued that Biden's nominee was not properly vetted on pressing immigration issues. On Thursday, Mayorkas' nomination advanced a procedural hurdle after the Senate voted to break a GOP filibuster. On Tuesday, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said that Mayorkas "does not deserve Senate confirmation." "I'll be voting against his confirmation and urge our colleagues to do the same," McConnell said. Mayorkas, who previously served as deputy secretary at DHS under former President Barack Obama, will also become the first foreign-born person to run the department. The 61-year-old Cuban immigrant evoked his heritage during his opening remarks before the Senate Homeland Security Committee. "The principles of homeland and security have been tremendously important in shaping my life. My father and mother brought me to this country to escape communism and to provide me with the security, opportunity, and pride that American citizenship brings to each of us," Mayorkas said. "I was raised to appreciate each day what this country has meant for our family, and the blessing it is to know it as our homeland," he added. Mayorkas confirmation follows Avril Haines , who became the first woman to the lead nation's 18 intelligence agencies as the director of national intelligence, Lloyd Austin , the nation's first Black Defense secretary, Janet Yellen who is the first female to lead the Department of Treasury and Anthony Blinken as the secretary of State and Pete Buttigieg as Transportation secretary.
Gen. John Raymond said the renewed interest in space has led to an explosion of recruitment at the U.S. Space Force, the Pentagon's youngest branch. The Space Force has increasingly looked to partner with the private sector as companies and investors pour into the space industry. The Pentagon is closely watching the progress of rocket builders like Rocket Lab, Astra and Virgin Orbit, in addition to SpaceX.	WASHINGTON – The nation's top general leading the U.S. military mission in space said Wednesday that he is excited about Wall Street and billionaire investment in the space industry, which has sparked renewed interest in the field among Americans and strong recruitment at the Pentagon's youngest branch. "There is a ton of excitement across America on space in all sectors," said Gen. John Raymond, the U.S. Space Force's chief of operations, when asked by CNBC about the strides made by private space companies like Elon Musk's SpaceX. "I've talked about people knocking on our door wanting to come into the Space Force in numbers greater than what we have slots to fill. I've talked in the past about how universities are seeing more students apply for space STEM degrees, which I think is going to be great for our nation," Raymond added. "I'm excited about all of it, both what we're doing here on national security and what's going on in the commercial industry that we can leverage the advantage," the four-star general said without specifically naming any companies. "The U.S. has always, has long understood that we are stronger with a secure and stable space domain and all of those sectors play into that," Raymond said. The U.S. Space Force, the Pentagon's youngest branch, has increasingly looked to partner with the private sector as companies and investors pour into the space industry. The Pentagon is closely watching the progress of rocket builders like Rocket Lab, Astra and Virgin Orbit in addition to SpaceX. Raymond's comments came on the heels of SpaceX announcing this week that it will fly its first all-civilian crew into orbit later this year , a mission known as Inspiration 4. The landmark flight, led by billionaire Jared Isaacman, is aimed at using high-profile space tourism to raise support for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Three yet-to-be-announced passengers will accompany Isaacman on the multiday journey around the Earth, with two of the seats to be decided in public online competitions this month. Raymond also called out NASA's Crew-1 mission, which was the first operational launch of SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft . "If you look at what's going on in the civil sector with the launch of U.S. astronauts, and in this last launch a Japanese astronaut from U.S. soil on a commercial launch vehicle, there's a ton of excitement there," he said. Raymond did not provide a reaction to SpaceX's Starship rocket test flight on Tuesday , which resulted in an explosion as it attempted to land. Starship prototype SN9 launched successfully to about 33,000 feet but, like the previous prototype flight in December, the rocket smashed into the ground while attempting to land. Private investment in space companies last year set a fresh annual record, despite industry fears that the Covid-19 pandemic would end the past decade's momentum, according to a report by Space Capital last month. Builders of rockets and satellites brought in $8.9 billion in 2020 , with venture capital and angel investors continuing to pour funds into space businesses.

The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was set to expire this week. It is the sole arms control treaty between Washington and Moscow, after former President Trump withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty. Like the INF treaty, New START limits the nuclear arsenals of Washington and Moscow. The U.S. and Russia own the lion’s share of the world’s nukes.	WASHINGTON –The Biden administration has extended a crucial nuclear weapons treaty with Russia for five more years, America's top diplomat announced Wednesday. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, was set to expire this week. The agreement is the sole arms control treaty in place between Washington and Moscow following former President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty . "President Biden pledged to keep the American people safe from nuclear threats by restoring U.S. leadership on arms control and nonproliferation," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday. "Today, the United States took the first step toward making good on that pledge when it extended the New START Treaty with the Russian Federation for five years." Similar to the INF treaty, New START limits the nuclear arsenals of Washington and Moscow. The United States and Russia own the lion's share of the world's nukes . Read more: Former ambassador warns expiration of key nuclear treaty with Russia would make the U.S. ‘worse off’ "The New START Treaty's verification regime enables us to monitor Russian compliance with the treaty and provides us with greater insight into Russia's nuclear posture, including through data exchanges and onsite inspections that allow U.S. inspectors to have eyes on Russian nuclear forces and facilities," Blinken said. The secretary of State added that the U.S. had assessed that Russia was in compliance with its New START Treaty obligations since the inception of the agreement in 2011. "The United States will use the time provided by a five-year extension of the New START Treaty to pursue with the Russian Federation, in consultation with Congress and U.S. allies and partners, arms control that addresses all of its nuclear weapons," Blinken said in a statement. Blinken also added that the Biden administration will work to pursue arms control "to reduce the dangers from China's modern and growing nuclear arsenal." State department spokesman Ned Price told reporters Wednesday that the Biden administration will "remain clear-eyed about the challenges that Russia poses." "Even as we work with Russia to advance U.S. interests so too will we hold Russia to account for its reckless and its adversarial behavior," Price said. Price also said that the five-year extension gives the U.S. "time and space to talk about the broader strategic stability elements" that stems from the arms control agreement.
A new report calls for the Biden administration to extend the May deadline for the U.S. military troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Afghanistan Study Group recommended in its sweeping report that the United States has a significant interest in safeguarding Afghanistan from "becoming again a safe haven for terrorists." The United States is currently slated to withdraw American service members from the war-torn country by May. There are approximately 2,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.	WASHINGTON – A new report requested by Congress calls for the Biden administration to extend the May deadline for the U.S. military troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Afghanistan Study Group , a bipartisan congressionally mandated panel under the United States Institute of Peace, recommended keeping U.S. troops in the war-torn country "in order to give the peace process sufficient time to produce an acceptable result." The United States is currently slated to withdraw American service members from the war-torn country by May 2021. The group wrote, in a report released Wednesday, that the United States has a significant interest in safeguarding Afghanistan from "becoming again a safe haven for terrorists." "We believe that a U.S. withdrawal will provide the terrorists an opportunity to reconstitute and our judgment is that reconstitution will take place within about 18 to 36 months," former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford told a virtual United States Institute of Peace audience. Dunford, a retired four-star Marine general, co-chairs the study group. "We also conclude and there will be no surprise to those who follow Afghanistan, that the Afghan forces are highly dependent on U.S. funding in operational support and they'll continue to be for some time to come," Dunford said. He also said that the group believes that the probability of civil war in Afghanistan will be "high in the wake of a precipitous withdrawal by the United States." Last February the United States brokered a deal with the Taliban that would usher in a permanent cease-fire and reduce the U.S. military's footprint from approximately 13,000 to 8,600 by mid-July last year. By May 2021, all foreign forces would leave the war-weary country, according to the deal. Last week, the Pentagon said that the U.S. troop drawdown in Afghanistan would be contingent on the Taliban's commitments to uphold the peace agreement reached last year. There are approximately 2,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. NATO joined the international security effort in Afghanistan in 2003 and currently has more than 7,000 troops in the country. The security operation by NATO in Afghanistan was launched after the alliance activated its mutual defense clause — known as Article 5 — for the first time in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria have cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1.57 trillion since Sept. 11, 2001, according to a Defense Department report . The war in Afghanistan, which has dragged on to become America's longest conflict, began 19 years ago and has cost U.S. taxpayers $193 billion, according to the Pentagon .
President Joe Biden announced the end of U.S. support for offensive operations in Yemen. Biden also tapped Tim Lenderking, deputy assistant secretary of State for Iran, Iraq, and regional multilateral affairs, to oversee the U.S. diplomatic mission in Yemen. The United Nations has previously said that the ongoing armed conflict in Yemen has produced the largest humanitarian crisis in the world.	WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden announced on Thursday the end of U.S. support for offensive operations in Yemen and named a new envoy to oversee the nation's diplomatic mission to end the civil war there, part of a broader foreign policy address highlighting greater U.S. engagement in the world. "This war has to end," Biden said during his first address on foreign policy as president. "We are ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen including relevant arms sales." "At the same time, Saudi Arabia faces missile attacks and UAV strikes and other threats from Iranian supplied forces in multiple countries," Biden said. "We are going to continue to help Saudi Arabia defend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity and its people." The president tapped Tim Lenderking, deputy assistant secretary of State for Iran, Iraq, and regional multilateral affairs, to oversee the U.S. diplomatic mission to end the war in Yemen. "I have asked my Middle East team to ensure our support for the United Nations' initiative to impose a ceasefire, open humanitarian channels and restore long-dormant peace talks," Biden said. "Tim's diplomacy will be bolstered by USAID working to ensure humanitarian aid is reaching the Yemeni people who are suffering an unendurable devastation," Biden said. However, Biden's policy ending support for offensive operations will not extend to military actions taken by the U.S. against al-Qaeda's affiliate in the region, known as AQAP. "It does not extend to actions against AQAP, which are actions we undertake in service of protecting the homeland and protecting American interests in the region and allies and partners," national security advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters at a White House press briefing earlier Thursday. "It extends to the types of offensive operations that have perpetuated a civil war in Yemen that has led to a humanitarian crisis," Sullivan said. The U.S. has informed Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of its decision, Sullivan said. He added the Biden administration halted sales of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia in order to assess potential human rights abuses. The Yemen civil war escalated in 2014 when Houthi forces, who are in alliance with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, took over the nation's capital. Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have carried out attacks in Yemen against the Houthis. The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen had previously enjoyed the backing of former President Donald Trump's administration. Trump vetoed a measure in 2019 aimed at ending U.S. military assistance and involvement in Yemen. At the time Trump said that the congressional resolution was "unnecessary" and that it endangered "the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future." Lawmakers who backed the measure criticized Saudi Arabia for a slew of bombing campaigns that contributed to civilian deaths in Yemen. The United Nations has previously said that the ongoing armed conflict in Yemen has produced the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. The U.S. has provided more than $630 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen in fiscal year 2020, according to figures provided by the State department. -- CNBC's Christian Nunley contributed to this report from Virginia.
President Joe Biden echoed his promise to repair alliances through diplomacy and restore Washington's leadership position on the global stage during a speech Thursday. "America is back, diplomacy is back," Biden said at the State Department, adding that his administration would work toward "reclaiming our credibility and moral authority." In a lengthy speech, Biden outlined his vision for addressing an array of global pressures, including the civil war in Yemen, trade relations with China and engaging malign Russian behaviors.	WASHINGTON –In his first foreign policy address since ascending to the nation's highest office, President Joe Biden vowed to repair alliances through diplomacy and restore Washington's leadership position on the global stage. "America is back, diplomacy is back," Biden said at the State Department , adding that his administration would work toward "reclaiming our credibility and moral authority." "I want the people who work in this building and in our embassies and consulates around the world to know that I value your expertise, and I respect you. I will have your back," Biden told State Department employees. "This administration is going to empower you to do your jobs, not target or politicize you," he added, recognizing the depleted ranks at the Department of State. In a lengthy speech, Biden outlined his vision for addressing an array of global hotspots, including the civil war in Yemen, trade relations with China and tensions with Russia. Biden rallied U.S. allies and partners and promised to stand "shoulder to shoulder" with them on a number of shared issues like climate change and the coronavirus pandemic . "When we strengthen our alliances we amplify our power as well as our ability to disrupt threats before they reach our shores," Biden said. "America cannot afford to be absent any longer on the world stage," he added. The Biden administration's message is a sharp break from the Trump administration's "America First" foreign policy. Throughout his presidency, Donald Trump frequently dressed down key U.S. allies. Trump also railed against NATO leaders claiming that members of the world's most powerful military alliance did not contribute enough financially to the group. He also made good on a threat to reduce U.S. military support if allies, like Germany, do not meet 2% of GDP spending, a goal set at the 2014 NATO summit in Wales. In 2019, Trump singled out Chancellor Angela Merkel during a NATO summit for not meeting the 2% goal. "So we're paying 4 to 4.3% when Germany's paying 1 to 1.2% at max 1.2% of a much smaller GDP. That's not fair," Trump said in December 2019 . Germany was only one of 19 NATO members that had not met the 2% GDP spending goal. In June, the Pentagon announced its plan to withdraw 9,500 U.S. military personnel from Germany in order to redeploy those forces elsewhere. On Thursday, Biden said that the Pentagon was instructed to halt any planned troop withdrawals from Germany. In his speech Thursday, Biden said that he would have a different approach in dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin compared with that of the Trump administration. "I made it very clear to President Putin in a manner very different from my predecessor that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russian aggressive actions, interfering with our elections, cyberattacks, poisoning its citizens, are over," Biden said. "We will be more effective in dealing with Russia when we work in coalition and coordination with other like-minded partners," he added. Biden also renewed calls for the immediate release of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was detained in Moscow last month and sentenced to more than two years in prison . "He's been targeted for exposing corruption and he should be released immediately and without condition," Biden said. Last year, Navalny was medically evacuated to Germany from a Russian hospital after he became ill following reports that something was added to his tea. Russian doctors treating Navalny denied that the Kremlin critic had been poisoned and blamed his comatose state on low blood sugar levels. In September, the German government said that the 44-year-old Russian dissident was poisoned by a chemical nerve agent, describing the toxicology report as providing " unequivocal evidence. " The nerve agent was in the family of Novichok, which was developed by the Soviet Union . The Kremlin has repeatedly denied having a role in Navalny's poisoning. Biden also discussed his recent decision to extend a crucial nuclear weapons treaty with Russia for five more years.

Blinken also added that the U.S. had assessed that Russia was in compliance with its New START Treaty obligations since the inception of the agreement in 2011. The crumbling relationship between Washington and Beijing has intensified following an attempt by the world's two largest economies to mend trade relations. Over the past four years, the Trump administration has placed blame squarely on China for a wide range of grievances, including intellectual property theft, unfair trade practices and recently, the coronavirus pandemic. Biden said he would work more closely with allies in order to mount pushback against China. "We will confront China's economic abuses," Biden explained, describing Beijing as America's "most serious competitor." "But we're also ready to work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so. We'll compete from a position of strength by building back better at home and working with our allies and partners." Biden has previously said that during his political career he has spent more time with China's Xi Jinping than any other world leader.

Biden also announced on Thursday that he would increase the nation's annual refugee admissions cap to 125,000 in the 12-month period starting Oct. 1. "The United States' moral leadership on refugee issues was a point of bipartisan consensus for so many decades," Biden said. "Our example pushed other nations to open wider doors as well. So today, I'm approving an executive order to begin the hard work of restoring our refugee admissions program to help meet the unprecedented global need," Biden said. "It's going to take time to rebuild what has been so badly damaged," he added. When Trump took office in 2017, the refugee ceiling for the fiscal year set by President Barack Obama stood at 110,000 . Trump left office after setting a cap of just 15,000 for the current fiscal year — the lowest level since the passage of the Refugee Act in 1980. The president will have to work with Congress in adjusting the annual limit. -- CNBC's Hannah Miao contributed to this report from New York.
Biden said in his first sitdown interview since ascending to the presidency that Iran would have to stop enriching uranium before his administration would lift sanctions. The Trump administration withdrew the United States from the JCPOA in 2018. Following Washington's exit from the nuclear deal, other signatories of the pact ⁠— France, Germany, the U.K., Russia and China ⁠— tried to keep the agreement alive. Tehran has refused to negotiate while U.S. sanctions remain in place.	WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden said the United States will not offer sanctions relief as a way to entice Iran back to the negotiating table over the country's nuclear program. Biden, in a clip from a CBS interview on Sunday, indicated that Iran would have to stop enriching uranium before his administration would lift sanctions. When asked if the U.S. would lift sanctions to get Iran back to the negotiating table, Biden said "no." Tensions between Washington and Tehran have mounted following former President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the landmark nuclear agreement . The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, brokered by the Obama administration, lifted sanctions on Iran that had crippled its economy and cut its oil exports roughly in half. In exchange for sanctions relief, Iran accepted limits on its nuclear program until the terms expire in 2025. The U.S. and its European allies believe Iran has ambitions to develop a nuclear bomb. Tehran has denied that allegation. Trump withdrew the United States from the JCPOA in 2018, calling it the "worst deal ever" Following Washington's exit from the landmark nuclear deal, other signatories of the pact ⁠— France, Germany, the U.K., Russia and China ⁠— tried to keep the agreement alive. Tehran has refused to negotiate while U.S. sanctions remain in place. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated on Sunday that Tehran would only return to compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal when Washington lifts sanctions, Iranian state TV reported . "Iran has fulfilled all its obligations under the deal, not the United States and the three European countries ... If they want Iran to return to its commitments, the United States must in practice ... lift all sanctions," state TV quoted Khamenei as saying. "Then, after verifying whether all sanctions have been lifted correctly, we will return to full compliance," he reportedly added. Washington's strained relationship with Tehran took several turns under the Trump administration that pushed the adversaries to the brink of war. Last year, the U.S. carried out an airstrike that killed Qasem Soleimani, Iran's top military commander. Soleimani's death led the regime to further scale back compliance with the international nuclear pact. In January, Iran said it would no longer limit its uranium enrichment capacity or nuclear research . In October, the United States unilaterally reimposed U.N. sanctions on Tehran through a snapback process, which other U.N. Security Council members have previously said Washington does not have the authority to execute because it withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018. A month later, a top Iranian nuclear scientist was assassinated near Tehran, which led Iran's government to allege that Israel was behind the attack with U.S. backing. During the summer of 2019, a string of attacks in the Persian Gulf further contributed to the deteriorating relationship. In June, U.S. officials said an Iranian surface-to-air missile shot down an American military surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz. Iran said the aircraft was over its territory. That strike came a week after the U.S. blamed Iran for attacks on two oil tankers in the Persian Gulf region and after four tankers were attacked in May. The U.S. that June slapped new sanctions on Iranian military leaders blamed for shooting down the drone. The measures also aimed to block financial resources for Khamenei. Tensions soared again in September of last year when the U.S. blamed Iran for strikes in Saudi Arabia on the world's largest crude processing plant and oil field. That attack forced the kingdom to cut its production operations in half and triggered the largest spike in crude prices in decades and renewed concerns of a new war in the Middle East. Iran maintains that it was not behind the attacks.
Biden said his administration was prepared for "extreme competition" with China but that his approach would be different than his predecessor. "I'm not going to do it the way Trump did. We are going to focus on the international rules of the road," Biden told CBS in an interview.

"I'm not going to do it the way Trump did. We are going to focus on the international rules of the road," Biden told in a CBS interview clip published Sunday. "We need not have a conflict but there is going to be extreme competition," he added. In his interview with CBS, Biden said that he had not yet spoken to China's Xi Jinping since ascending to the nation's highest office last month. "I know him pretty well," Biden said, explaining that as vice president he spent more time with Xi than any world leader has. "He's very bright and he's very tough and – I don't mean it as a criticism it's just a reality – he doesn't have a democratic...bone in his body." The tension between Beijing and Washington, the world's two largest economies, soared under the Trump administration. Over the past four years, Trump has placed blame squarely on China for a wide range of grievances, including intellectual property theft, unfair trade practices and recently the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 460,000 Americans. Last week, Biden said he would work more closely with allies in order to mount pushback against China.

"But we're also ready to work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so. We'll compete from a position of strength by building back better at home and working with our allies and partners," the president said at the State Department. Though Biden has not yet spoken with Xi, Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked for the first time with his Chinese counterpart , Yang Jiechi, over the weekend. In a tense call, Blinken told Yang the U.S. would hold China accountable for its actions, particularly as it regards Taiwan. He also called for Beijing to condemn the recent military coup in Myanmar. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Blinken told lawmakers that Trump "was right in taking a tougher approach to China." "I disagree, very much, with the way that he went about it in a number of areas, but the basic principle was the right one, and I think that's actually helpful to our foreign policy," Blinken said a day before Biden's inauguration.
President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday a new Defense Department task force aimed at assessing the U.S. military's China strategy. "That's how we'll meet the China challenge and ensure the American people win the competition in the future," Biden said in his first visit as commander in chief to the Pentagon. Biden on Wednesday punted on a question about whether the U.S. would hold China accountable over the Covid-19 outbreak.	WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden announced Wednesday a new Defense Department task force aimed at assessing the U.S. military's China strategy. "That's how we'll meet the China challenge and ensure the American people win the competition in the future," Biden said in his first visit as commander in chief to the Pentagon. The new Pentagon group, made up of approximately 15 experts, will be responsible for providing recommendations on China-related matters to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Findings and recommendations are due within four months. "No final public report is anticipated, although the department will discuss recommendations with Congress and other stakeholders as appropriate," the Pentagon wrote in a statement announcing the new task force. China's influence over global commerce and international relations has continued to grow, even as the nation has faced calls for accountability over its initial handling of the Covid-19 crisis . The novel coronavirus, which causes the disease, originated in China in late 2019. Biden on Wednesday punted on a question about whether the U.S. would hold China accountable. Biden, who has yet to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping , said last week during an address at the State Department that he would work more closely with allies in order to mount pushback against Beijing.

"I'm not going to do it the way Trump did. We are going to focus on the international rules of the road," Biden said Sunday. After his remarks at the Pentagon on Wednesday, a reporter asked Biden whether he had any interest in punishing China over the nation's lack of transparency about the Covid-19 outbreak last year. "I'm interesting in getting all the facts," Biden said, according to a pool report. Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked for the first time with his Chinese counterpart , Yang Jiechi, over the weekend. In a tense call, Blinken told Yang the U.S. would hold China to account for a slew of issues including human rights abuses. Blinken also called on Beijing to condemn the recent military coup in Myanmar. Earlier on Wednesday, Biden announced sanctions on military leaders in Myanmar who directed the coup on Feb. 1. Biden also reiterated calls for Myanmar's military to relinquish the power it seized and to release its prisoners. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the United States was coordinating with partners to roll out "steep and profound" retaliatory actions. Biden, who spoke alongside Vice President Kamala Harris and Austin, also took a moment to thank service members and their civilian support staff. He is the first president in 40 years to have a child serve in the U.S. military and deploy to a war zone. "The Biden family knows what service to country feels like and they understand sacrifice. They know how to look after those who look to them for leadership," Austin, who served with the president's late son Beau Biden in Iraq, said in his introductory remarks. Following the Pentagon address, Austin led Biden and Harris on a tour of the building's corridor dedicated to Black service members. Austin is the nation's first Black secretary of Defense, and Harris is the first Black vice president.
Biden warned a bipartisan group of senators in a meeting Thursday that China is aggressively outpacing the United States on infrastructure. "They're investing a lot of money, they're investing billions of dollars and dealing with a whole range of issues that relate to transportation, the environment and a whole range of other things," Biden said. The meeting and a telephone call between Xi and Biden come as the new U.S. administration works to address human rights abuses and mend trade relations with the world's second-largest economy.	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden warned lawmakers Thursday that China is aggressively outpacing the United States on infrastructure. "They're investing a lot of money, they're investing billions of dollars and dealing with a whole range of issues that relate to transportation, the environment and a whole range of other things," Biden said he told a bipartisan group of senators whom he met with in the Oval Office. "They have a major, major new initiative on rail and they already have rail that goes 225 miles an hour with ease," he explained, adding that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping for two hours on Wednesday . "They're going to, you know, if we don't get moving, they're going to eat our lunch," Biden said after the meeting with the members of the Environment and Public Works committee. "We just have to step up. And so what I'd like to talk to these folks about — since they are the key committee — is how we begin this. I've laid out what I think we should be doing," the president added. The phone call with Xi and the meeting with lawmakers come as the new U.S. administration works to address human rights abuses and mend trade relations with the world's second-largest economy. Last week during an address at the State Department Biden said that he would work more closely with allies in order to mount pushback against Beijing. "We will confront China's economic abuses," Biden said, describing Beijing as America's "most serious competitor." The tension between Beijing and Washington, the world's two largest economies, soared under the Trump administration, which escalated a trade war and worked to ban Chinese technology companies from doing business in the U.S. In an interview with CBS, Biden said that his administration is ready for "extreme competition" with China but that his approach would be different from his predecessor's . "I'm not going to do it the way Trump did. We are going to focus on the international rules of the road," Biden said Sunday. After his remarks at the Pentagon on Wednesday, a reporter asked Biden whether he had any interest in punishing China over the nation's lack of transparency about the Covid-19 outbreak last year. "I'm interested in getting all the facts," Biden said, according to a pool report. Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked for the first time with his Chinese counterpart , Yang Jiechi, over the weekend. In a tense call, Blinken told Yang the U.S. would hold China to account for a slew of issues including human rights abuses. Blinken also called on Beijing to condemn the recent military coup in Myanmar.
State Department said Thursday that it is continuing an investigation on mysterious neurological symptoms reported by American diplomats in Cuba. In 2016, U.S. diplomats and their support staff stationed in Havana reported hearing strange sounds, steady pulses of pressure in their heads and a number of other bizarre physical sensations. Physicians enlisted by the State Department said that brain scans of 21 affected U.S. personnel showed structural changes to the brain that had not been identified or linked to any known disorder.	WASHINGTON – The State Department said Thursday that while it investigates mysterious neurological symptoms reported by American diplomats in Cuba, it will install a new senior-level advisor to manage future incidents. "This advisor will be positioned in a senior role and will report directly to the department's senior leadership to ensure, as I said, that we continue to make significant strides to address this issue and to ensure our people are receiving the treatment they need," State spokesman Ned Price told reporters Thursday. Price said the investigation is a high priority for Secretary Antony Blinken and that the matter was one of the first briefings he requested from the transition team. "We have no higher priority than the safety and the security of U.S. personnel, their families, other U.S. citizens both of course in this country and around the world," he added, when asked about the peculiar episodes experienced by U.S. diplomats in Cuba. In 2016, U.S. diplomats and their support staff stationed in Havana reported hearing strange sounds, steady pulses of pressure in their heads and a number of other bizarre physical sensations. In some cases, diplomats noticed a sharp deterioration in their hearing and vision. Canadian diplomats serving missions in Havana also reported similar symptoms. Physicians enlisted by the State Department said that brain scans of 21 affected U.S. personnel showed structural changes to the brain that had not been identified or linked to any known disorder. The State Department gradually evacuated most of its diplomatic staff from Havana by 2018. In August 2020 the travel advisory to Cuba was increased to Level 4, the highest warning, amid Covid-19 concerns. Included in the travel advisory was the following warning: The Cuban government has denied any knowledge or involvement in the incidents involving American diplomats.
The Senate acquitted Trump in a 57-43 vote on the charge of inciting insurrection for his role in the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Republican Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania voted to convict Trump. Democrats needed 17 Republicans to join them to convict Trump.	WASHINGTON – Seven Republican senators alongside all Democrats found former President Donald Trump guilty on Saturday for inciting the riot at the U.S. Capitol, though the bipartisan vote wasn't enough to reach the two-thirds majority required to convict. In Trump's second impeachment trial, Republican Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania voted to convict the 45th president. The seven GOP senators joined 48 Democrats and two senators who are independents. The Senate acquitted Trump in a 57-43 vote on the charge of inciting insurrection for his role in the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Democrats needed 17 Republicans to join them to convict Trump. Some Republicans who voted for acquittal based their vote largely on procedural grounds, not the merits of the case. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, for example, said Trump was responsible for the riot and suggested the former president could still face criminal charges. The verdict came after House impeachment managers reversed course and dropped a call for witnesses that would have delayed the outcome. The acquittal marks the end of a five-day impeachment trial. Trump is the first president to be impeached and tried twice. During Trump's first impeachment trial, Romney was the sole Republican to break from his party and convict the president. The Senate acquitted Trump in 2020 on impeachment charges stemming from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. "President Trump incited the insurrection against Congress by using the power of his office to summon his supporters to Washington on January 6th and urging them to march on the Capitol during the counting of electoral votes. He did this despite the obvious and well-known threats of violence that day," Romney explained in a statement. "President Trump also violated his oath of office by failing to protect the Capitol, the Vice President, and others in the Capitol. Each and every one of these conclusions compels me to support conviction," he added. Collins faced a fiercely contested senate race in Maine last year due to her support for Trump's judicial nominees, but broke with her party over the former president's actions during the Capitol riot. She explained her vote to convict from the Senate floor. "Instead of preventing a dangerous situation, President Trump created one. And rather than defend the constitutional transfer of power, he incited an insurrection with the purpose of preventing that transfer of power from occurring," Collins said. "His actions – they interfere with the peaceful transition of power, the hallmark of our constitution and our American democracy – were an abuse of power and constitute grounds for conviction." Murkowski , who is up for re-election in 2022, previously called for Trump's resignation on the heels of the riot at the Capitol. "Before someone assumes the office of the presidency, they are required to swear to faithfully execute the office of the President and to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States," Murkowski wrote after the trial. "President Trump – the nation's elected leader, the Commander in Chief of our armed forces – swore an oath to defend America and all that we hold sacred. He failed to uphold that oath," she added. Toomey had also called for the president's resignation. He has stated that he will not run for re-election when his seat expires in 2022. "I was one of the 74 million Americans who voted for President Trump, in part because of the many accomplishments of his administration. Unfortunately, his behavior after the election betrayed the confidence millions of us placed in him," Toomey wrote in a statement. "His betrayal of the Constitution and his oath of office required conviction," he added Sasse said last month that he was open to considering articles of impeachment against the former Republican president. "An impeachment trial is a public declaration of what a president's oath of office means and what behavior that oath demands of presidents in the future," Sasse wrote after conviction. "But here's the sad reality: If we were talking about a Democratic president, most Republicans and most Democrats would simply swap sides. Tribalism is a hell of a drug, but our oath to the Constitution means we're constrained to the facts," Sasse added. Burr, who has said he will not seek re-election, had previously voted to dismiss the impeachment trial on constitutional grounds. Burr's term expires in 2022. "I have listened to the arguments presented by both sides and considered the facts. The facts are clear," explained Burr in a statement. "By what he did and by what he did not do, President Trump violated his oath of office to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States," he explained, adding that he didn't come to "this decision lightly." Cassidy originally said he would dismiss the trial on the grounds that it was unconstitutional but then switched his vote in the past week saying Trump's lawyers had done a "terrible" job explaining the matter. "He brought together a crowd but a portion of that was transformed into a mob, and when they went into the Capitol it was clear that he wished lawmakers be intimidated," Cassidy told ABC's "This Week" in explaining his vote to convict. "And even after he knew violence was taking place, he continued to basically sanction the mob being there. And not until later did he actually ask them to leave. All of that points to a motive and a method and that is wrong — he should be held accountable. Cassidy is already facing pushback in his home state. The executive committee of the Louisiana Republican Party voted unanimously to censure Cassidy for his vote to convict Trump. Trump's defense team denied that the former president incited the attack and argued that the former president's rhetoric was protected under the First Amendment. His lawyers also described the trial as unconstitutional since Trump was no longer president. "Democrats were obsessed with impeaching Mr. Trump from the very beginning of his term," Trump lawyer Michael van der Veen said in closing arguments. "In short, this impeachment has been a complete charade from beginning to end. The entire spectacle has been nothing but the unhinged pursuit of a longstanding political vendetta against Mr. Trump by the opposition party," he added. Lead impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland urged senators to consider what he described as "overwhelming," "irrefutable" and "unrefuted" evidence during his closing remarks. "This trial, in the final analysis, is not about Donald Trump. The country and the world know who Donald Trump is. This trial is about who we are," Raskin said.
Iran says its uranium metal development is meant to produce fuel for a research reactor. IAEA inspectors confirmed a tiny volume of 3.6 grams of the substance at an Isfahan facility. Iran has been incrementally rolling back its compliance with its 2015 nuclear deal since May 2019, after the Trump administration withdrew from the deal and imposed sanctions on Iran.	Iran's latest move in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal has caught international powers' attention, raising the stakes for a return to the multi-country agreement as it demands the lifting of U.S. sanctions. UN nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) last week confirmed a report that Iran has begun producing uranium metal, a step that violates the parameters of the 2015 deal — also known as the JCPOA — which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs to its nuclear program. Non-enriched, uranium metal has little civilian use and is different from enriched uranium, which can be used for nuclear energy. Iran says it activity is meant to produce fuel for a research reactor. IAEA inspectors confirmed a minutely small volume of 3.6 grams (0.1 ounces) of the substance at an Isfahan facility — less than the size of a thimble. But it's raised the alarm for some in the international community, since a greater quantity of the metal — about half a kilogram, according to experts — can be used to build the core of a nuclear bomb. "This is one of the most serious nuclear steps that they've taken," a former Obama administration official involved in the original JCPOA negotiations told CNBC, referring to Iran. "It's pretty provocative." The former official spoke on condition of anonymity due to professional constraints on speaking to the press. The U.K., France and Germany, all supporters of the JCPOA, said in January that Iran has "no credible civilian use for uranium metal." They described the news as "deeply concerning." "The production of uranium metal has potentially grave military implications," they warned. Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the Europeans' statement is significant. "You know you're in trouble when the Europeans don't buy the 'civilian use' argument put forward by Tehran. That's what should ring alarm bells," he said. Iran has been incrementally rolling back its compliance to the JCPOA since May 2019, one year after the Trump administration withdrew from the deal and started imposing heavy "maximum pressure" sanctions on the country for what it described as its destabilizing regional activities. Tehran's moves most recently included increasing its uranium enrichment and stockpile levels beyond the limits set out in the deal, in an effort to pressure Washington to lift the sanctions — which have crippled the Iranian economy — and return to the deal, something the Biden administration has expressed its desire to do. Importantly, Iran's officials stress that the moves are reversible and have held out hope for a return to the agreement under Biden. But the White House says that Iran must come back into full compliance with the deal first, while Iran says U.S. sanctions must be lifted first, setting up a potential stalemate. Still, regional experts believe the nuclear deal remains salvageable. Iran is "trying to underscore how important it is to them to get the U.S. back in the JCPOA," the former Obama official said. "I don't think that this undermines at all the possibility of getting back in the JCPOA, but it is troubling." Aniseh Tabrizi, a senior research fellow and Iran expert at the Royal United Services Institute, agreed. "It's reversible, especially if done in the short term," she said of Iran's uranium metal production. "There has been condemnation, but no signal that this is the end of any attempt to revive talks on the JCPOA." In the meantime, however, "Iran has the capability of putting significant short term pressure" on the deal's other signatories, said Sanam Vakil, deputy head of the Middle East North Africa program at Chatham House, a U.K. think tank. " But over the long run," she said, "it's the United States that needs to be brought into the joint commission discussions," because the U.S. is central to the deal and sanctions relief for Iran. A key date to watch is Feb. 21 — at which point, new hardline laws passed by Iran's parliament take effect, including a ruling that prevents further IAEA inspections. But it's crucial, Vakil said, that the crisis be contained before Iran's June elections. "If the international community is really keen on containing this crisis with Iran, rolling out the JCPOA compliance strategy and setting in motion a plan to talk with Iran and the joint commission is essential," she said. "The sooner that they can roll that out, the better they can sort of mitigate Iran's further efforts of upping the ante." For FDD's Ben Taleblu, Iran's tactics are so far both dangerous and futile. "Tehran's continuing nuclear escalation means that its new violations are necessarily more dangerous," he said. "Despite Iran's escalatory strategy, neither the Trump or Biden team has as of yet reversed course on major economic sanctions."
The Biden administration is not ruling out a potential response to the rocket attack in Iraq which killed a contractor and injured a U.S. service member. "The president of the United States and the administration reserves the right to respond in a timely manner of our choosing," said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reached out to Kurdistan Regional Government Prime Minister Masrour Barzani to offer assistance with the investigation.	The Biden administration on Tuesday would not rule out potential retaliation against those behind Monday's deadly rocket attack in Iraq . The attack in the city of Irbil in the Kurdistan region killed one civilian contractor and injured nine more people, including a U.S. service member, according to U.S. Army Col. Wayne Marotto, spokesman for the coalition fighting ISIS. At least three rockets hit near the civilian Irbil International Airport late Monday night, Kurdish security sources told NBC News. A nearby base houses U.S. troops. The Biden administration said it would wait to find out who was responsible for the attack before deciding how to react. "The president of the United States and the administration reserves the right to respond in a timely manner of our choosing," White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Tuesday during a news briefing, shortly before offering condolences to the deceased. "But we'll wait for the attribution to be concluded first before we take any additional steps. I will convey to you that diplomacy is a priority with this administration," she added. Psaki said the United States was carrying out an investigation to determine who was behind the attack. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Tuesday that Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with the Kurdistan region's prime minister, Masrour Barzani, on the heels of the attack. Price also said that the top U.S. diplomat talked to Iraq's prime minister, Mustafa Al-Kadhimi, on Tuesday. "Once we have identified a perpetrator, then it would be more appropriate to look into the motive," Price said when asked about a possible U.S. response. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin also spoke on Tuesday to Iraqi Minister of Defense Jumaah Saadoon to discuss the attack. The Pentagon said the officials reaffirmed their commitment to the strategic partnership between the United States and Iraq. In 2019, the U.S. attributed a rocket attack on a military base near Kirkurk to Kataib Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militia group. The attack triggered a U.S. response which killed a top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani. Monday's attack comes as the world's most powerful military alliance, NATO, meets virtually Wednesday and Thursday to discuss the next steps in Iraq.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. will pay the more than $200 million it owes to the World Health Organization by the end of the month. Blinken also called for his counterparts to combat misinformation on vaccines and to share any relevant information on the origins of the coronavirus to investigators. In one of his first acts as president, Biden rescinded former President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO.	WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the United States will pay the more than $200 million it owes to the World Health Organization by the end of the month, a move that reaffirms the new administration's commitment to global health. "This is a key step forward in fulfilling our financial obligations as a WHO member and it reflects our renewed commitment to ensuring the WHO has the support it needs to lead the global response to the pandemic even as we work to reform it for the future," Blinken told the U.N. Security Council during a videoconference. "The United States will work with our partners across the globe to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity and to increase access, including marginalized populations," Blinken said, in his first speech since becoming the nation's top diplomat. Blinken also called for his counterparts to combat misinformation on vaccines and to share any relevant information on the origins of the coronavirus to investigators. "The ongoing expert investigation about the origins of this pandemic and the report that will be issued must be independent with findings based on science and facts and free from interference," Blinken said. "To better understand this pandemic and prepare for the next one, all countries must make available all data from the earliest days of the outbreak," he added. Blinken's remarks come as President Joe Biden works to address the unfolding coronavirus pandemic that has claimed more than 2.4 million lives around the world and infected more than 109.6 million, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University . In the United States, the coronavirus has infected more than 27.7 million people and killed at least 488,295 people. In one of his first acts as president, Biden rescinded former President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the United Nations' health organization, which is based in Geneva. In April, Trump said he suspended U.S. funding to the organization pending a review , citing what he called "the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus." A month later, he announced his intentions to remove the U.S. from the organization amid the coronavirus pandemic, citing what he called the WHO's misuse of funding and its cozy relationship with China. "China has total control over the World Health Organization, despite only paying $40 million per year compared to what the United States has been paying, which is approximately $450 million a year," Trump said . In July, the Trump administration submitted to the U.N. secretary-general its notice withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization by July 6, 2021 . In October, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he hoped the United States would reconsider its decision to leave the WHO , adding that the coronavirus can't be defeated "in a divided world." "The problem is not about the money. It's not the financing that's the issue. It's actually the relationship with the U.S. that's more important and its leadership abroad," Ghebreyesus told a virtual audience at the Aspen Security Forum.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is Saudi Arabia's 35-year-old heir to the throne and arguably the most powerful man in the region. President Joe Biden early on promised to take a harder line on the oil-rich Islamic monarchy than his predecessor Donald Trump did. "The Saudis in Washington are in the worst position they've ever been," a former Obama administration official told CNBC.	UNITED ARAB EMIRATES – President Joe Biden 's press secretary delivered a striking message to Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, this week. Jen Psaki told a news conference, using diplomatic language, that the U.S.-Saudi relationship — particularly that with the kingdom's crown prince — is being downgraded. "On Saudi Arabia I would say we've made clear from the beginning that we are going to recalibrate our relationship with Saudi Arabia," Psaki said Tuesday from the White House. On the question of whether Biden would be speaking with the crown prince, she replied: "Part of that is going back to engagement counterpart-to-counterpart. The president's counterpart is King Salman, and I expect that at an appropriate time, he would have a conversation with him. I don't have a timeline on that." The quotes drew instant attention from regional analysts and foreign policy experts, and likely leaders in the Gulf as well, as a blatant snub of Saudi Arabia's 35-year-old heir to the monarchy and arguably the most powerful man in the region. "Well, I think what Jen said, in fact, I know what she said is that the president would be engaging with his counterpart, and this his counterpart, is the King," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters Wednesday. Price added that Secretary of State Antony Blinken will similarly engage with his counterpart, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. "President Biden has said that we'll review the entirety of that relationship to make sure that it advances the interests and is respectable and is respectful of the values that we bring to that partnership," Price said. "We of course know that Saudi is an important partner on many different fronts regional security counterterrorism are just two of them," he added. "The snub to MBS represents a warning to Saudi Arabia," Torbjorn Soltvedt, principal MENA analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, wrote in an email note Wednesday, referring to the crown prince by his initials. "It will be seen as a disapproval of MBS's leadership which has been characterized by unpredictable decision-making and a much less consultative approach than in the past." And the administration's apparent intention to sideline the crown prince represents a dramatic departure from the Trump White House, which made Saudi Arabia the former president's first overseas visit, signed major arms deals with the kingdom in defiance of congressional opposition, and refrained from criticizing the kingdom over its human rights violations. This shouldn't come as a huge surprise, since Biden early on promised a harder line on the oil-rich Islamic monarchy. During a primary debate in early 2020, Biden pledged to make Saudi Arabia "the pariah that they are." "This is hardly a surprising move, but it is bold, and it will hurt," Michael Stephens, an analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told CNBC. "There's no doubt that Psaki's comments were targeted at the crown prince, even though he is to all intents and purposes the man in charge of the kingdom." A number of scandals and crises coming from the kingdom since the crown prince came to power have drawn condemnation not just from Democrats, but Republicans as well. According to one former Obama administration official, speaking anonymously due to professional constraints, "The Saudis in Washington are in the worst position they've ever been. It's just been covered up by the Trump White House." The Saudi government did not respond to CNBC requests for comment. Already, Biden has put a pause on a major weapons sale to the kingdom and other Gulf allies signed under the Trump administration, and he mandated an end to U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has created what the U.N. calls the world's worst man-made humanitarian crisis. And the kingdom came under international condemnation for the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by state agents. U.S. intelligence linked the death to the crown prince, something Riyadh forcefully denies. "With the ongoing war in Yemen, the crackdown on prominent members of the country's political and business elite in 2017, the killing of Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, and the oil price war last year, there's no shortage of raw issues for the Biden administration to take umbrage with,"  Soltvedt wrote. But how realistic is the Biden team's aim to bypass the crown prince — who is also minister of defense, next in line for the throne and has been making the bulk of the kingdom's major decisions? According to Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst close to the kingdom's royal court, it isn't realistic at all. "They can't get anything done if they don't deal with MBS," Shihabi was quoted as telling Politico . "The king is functioning, but he's very old. He's chairman of the board. He's not involved in day-to-day issues. Eventually, they're going to want to be talking directly to MBS." King Salman, the reigning monarch since 2015, is now 85 years old. Verisk's Soltvedt agrees. "King Salman is the head of state and ultimately holds the levers of power. But it is MBS who exercises direct control over the kingdom's most important portfolios and institutions," he wrote. "A shift in Washington's approach to its dealings with the Saudi leadership won't change that." While the Biden administration is expected to place a lower priority on the Gulf states than his predecessor did, they still remain America's preeminent weapons customers and regional counterterrorism partners, as well as suppliers of oil — though less and less so by the year for the latter. So while the Biden team is signaling a shift, it's not going to be a break in relations, many foreign policy experts believe. "I think the most important thing to realize is over the years U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia has been relatively consistent irrespective of which party has been in power," said Tarek Fadlallah, Middle East CEO at Nomura. "There's going to be a slightly different tone between this White House and the last White House," Fadlallah said. "But I don't think it's going to be consequential in terms of policy toward the region or policy toward Saudi Arabia." -- CNBC's Amanda Macias contributed to this report from Washington.
The Biden administration vowed that there will be consequences for those behind the deadly rocket attack earlier this week in northern Iraq. "It is fair to say that there will be consequences for any group responsible for this attack," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.

WASHINGTON – The Biden administration vowed on Wednesday that there will be consequences for those behind the deadly rocket attack earlier this week in northern Iraq. "It is fair to say that there will be consequences for any group responsible for this attack," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters during a briefing. The attack in the city of Irbil in the Kurdistan region killed one civilian contractor and injured nine others, including a U.S. service member, according to U.S. Army Col. Wayne Marotto, spokesman for the coalition fighting ISIS. At least three rockets hit near the civilian Irbil International Airport late Monday night, Kurdish security sources told NBC News. A nearby base houses U.S. troops. Price's remarks Wednesday represents a slight escalation in the Biden addministration's stance on the strike. On the heels of the attack, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration was carrying out an investigation with its allies in the region . When pressed on a potential U.S. response, Psaki said that the United States "reserves the right to respond in a timely manner of our choosing." "But we'll wait for the attribution to be concluded first before we take any additional steps. I will convey to you that diplomacy is a priority with this administration," she said, without giving further details. The rocket attack in Iraq comes as NATO, the world's most powerful military alliance, meets to discuss coalition-led missions in Iraq and Afghanistan . "I expect ministers will agree to launch an expanded mission, with more allied personnel training and advising in more security institutions across the country," NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday. "The mission will expand gradually in response to the situation," Stoltenberg said, adding that the NATO members had received requests from the Iraqi government. The Pentagon is "enthusiastic about and welcomes NATO's increased focus on Iraq," a senior Defense official told reporters ahead of the NATO meeting. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, would not disclose whether the U.S. military would contribute more troops to the fight in Iraq.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance will expand its security training mission in Iraq. The decision to expand NATO's footprint in Iraq comes on the heels of a deadly rocket attack in the city of Irbil. The United States has 2,500 troops in Iraq.	WASHINGTON – NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced Thursday that the 30-member alliance will expand its security training mission in Iraq in order to prevent the war-torn country from becoming a safe haven for international terrorists. "The size of our mission will increase from 500 personnel to around 4,000 and training activities will now include more Iraqi security institutions and areas beyond Baghdad," Stoltenberg told reporters at the conclusion of a two-day virtual NATO defense ministers meeting. "Our presence is conditions-based and increases in troop numbers will be incremental," he said, adding that the request for an expanded mission was made by the Iraqi government. Earlier in the week, a senior Defense official told reporters ahead of the NATO meeting that the Pentagon was "enthusiastic about and welcomes NATO's increased focus on Iraq." The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, would not disclose whether the U.S. military was prepared to contribute more troops to the training mission in Iraq. The United States has 2,500 troops in Iraq. "ISIS still operates in Iraq and we need to make sure they're not able to return," Stoltenberg said Thursday, adding that the alliance has seen a slight uptick in attacks. The decision to expand NATO's footprint in Iraq comes on the heels of a deadly rocket attack in the city of Irbil . The Monday attack claimed the life of one civilian contractor and injured nine others, including a U.S. service member, according to U.S. Army Col. Wayne Marotto, spokesman for the coalition fighting ISIS. A Shia group named Saraya Awliya al-Dam claimed responsibility for the strike and is believed to be a front for an Iranian-backed militia group. The White House, Pentagon and State Department have not publicly confirmed who is behind the attack. The State Department vowed Wednesday to impose consequences on those responsible but gave few details. "We're not going to preview a response, but it is fair to say that there will be consequences for any group responsible for this attack," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters during a press briefing. "Any response we take will be in full coordination with the government of Iraq and with our coalition partners as well," he added. A day after the attack, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the White House was "outraged" by the violence in Iraq. Psaki also said the Biden administration was working with partners in the region to carry out an investigation of the attack.
Retail sales volumes fell 8.2% compared with December, a far bigger fall than the 2.5% decrease forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and the second largest on record after the fall in April 2020, at the start of the pandemic.	British retail sales tumbled in January as non-essential shops went back into lockdowns, official data showed, but lower-than-expected public borrowing offered some relief to finance minister Rishi Sunak as he prepares a budget plan. Retail sales volumes fell 8.2% compared with December, a far bigger fall than the 2.5% decrease forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and the second largest on record after the fall in April 2020, at the start of the pandemic. "The decrease seen this time was not as large as that of the first lockdown, as some stores have adapted to the current circumstances, with services such as click-and-collect helping to cushion the fall," ONS statistician Jonathan Athow said. The Office for National Statistics also said public sector borrowing for January came in at 8.8 billion pounds ($12.3 billion), its first January deficit in a decade, but a lot less than a forecast of 24.5 billion pounds in the Reuters poll. That took borrowing since the start of the financial year in April to 270.6 billion pounds, reflecting the huge increase in spending and tax cuts ordered by Sunak since the start of the pandemic. Sunak is due to announce his next spending and tax plans on March 3 when he is expected to extend the government's wages subsidies, at least for the hardest-hit sectors of the economy. The ONS data also showed public debt rose to 2.115 trillion pounds or 97.9% of gross domestic product, a share not seen since the early 1960s. Britain's economy - which had its biggest slump in 300 years in 2020 when it shrank by 10% - is on course to contract by 4% in the first three months of 2021, according to the Bank of England, due to the latest lockdowns. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will lift the lockdown in England only gradually. But Britain's rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations - Europe's fastest program so far - has raised the prospect of a bounce-back later this year. A survey published earlier on Friday showed British consumers were their most confident since the COVID-19 pandemic struck almost a year ago. Friday's ONS data showed the month-on-month fall in retail sales between December and January was steeper than a fall of 4.0% in November, when non-essential retailers were also closed. In April last year, shortly after the first lockdown began, sales volumes plunged 18.0%. Sales in January were down 5.9% compared with the same month in 2020. Department stores and clothing stores saw the sharpest fall in sales last month, while online shopping rose to its highest ever share of total spending at 35.2%.
President Joe Biden said Friday that the United States was fully committed to the NATO military alliance. "An attack on one is an attack on all. That is our unshakeable vow," Biden said, referencing NATO's mutual defense clause, known as Article 5. Trump frequently dressed down NATO members throughout his presidency and had previously threatened to leave the alliance.	WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden promised on Friday to repair what he called "strained" relationships with European allies and NATO partners in the wake of his predecessor's "America first" foreign policy. In an address to the annual Munich Security Conference, Biden said that the United States will "earn back our position of trusted leadership," telling the virtual audience "America is back." "I know, I know the past few years of strain have tested our transatlantic relationship, but the United States is determined to re-engage with Europe," Biden said without naming former President Donald Trump . "Our partnerships have endured and grown through the years because they are rooted in the richness of our shared democratic values. They're not transactional. They're not extractive. They're built on a vision of the future where every voice matters," Biden said. Biden, who ascended to the nation's highest office a month ago, also said the United States was fully committed to the NATO military alliance. "An attack on one is an attack on all. That is our unshakeable vow," Biden said, referencing NATO's mutual defense clause, known as Article 5. To date, the 30-member alliance has only invoked Article 5 once — in defense of the United States in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Biden's remarks come on the heels of his administration's debut this week at the NATO defense minister's meeting. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin reiterated Washington's commitment to the world's most powerful military alliance and a more coordinated approach to global security.

During a May 2017 visit to the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Trump declined to reaffirm U.S. commitment to the alliance's Article 5 clause. Trump, who spoke in front of NATO's 9/11 memorial, thanked allies for their swift response to invoke Article 5 but would not explicitly say if the U.S. would do the same. Two months later, Trump ended his conspicuous silence on the matter and said during a Rose Garden address that he was "committing the United States to Article 5." In December 2019, Trump reiterated at the NATO leaders meeting in London that too many members were still not paying enough and threatened to reduce U.S. military support if allies do not increase spending. Trump singled out German Chancellor Angela Merkel for not meeting the 2% of GDP spending goal set in the 2014 NATO summit in Wales. "So we're paying 4[%] to 4.3% when Germany's paying 1[%] to 1.2% at max 1.2% of a much smaller GDP. That's not fair," Trump said at the time. Germany, at the time, was only one of 19 NATO members that had not met the 2% GDP spending goal set at the 2014 summit. Last year, Germany's president kicked off the annual Munich Security Conference by taking a swipe at then-President Trump's "America First" foreign policy approach. In his opening remarks, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned that the United States would put its own interests first at the expense of allies. "Our closest ally, the United States of America, under the current administration, rejects the very concept of the international community," he said. "'Great again but at the expense of neighbors and partners," Steinmeier added without naming Trump but referring to his "Make America Great Again" campaign slogan. "Thinking and acting this way hurts us all," he said.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday that the Biden administration had not yet whether the United States would withdraw its troops by the May 1 deadline. "There will be no surprises. We will consult each other, consult together and decide together and act together," Austin said of the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan. By May 2021, all foreign forces would leave the war-weary country, according to the deal. There are about 2,500 U.S. troops currently in the country. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, bipartisan lawmakers pressed a panel of experts on Friday that recommend the United States not reduce its military presence in Afghanistan.	WASHINGTON – Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday that the Biden administration had not yet decided whether the United States would withdraw its troops by the May 1 deadline. Last February the United States brokered a deal with the Taliban that would usher in a permanent cease-fire and reduced further the U.S. military's footprint from approximately 13,000 troops to 8,600 by mid-July last year. By May 2021, all foreign forces would leave the war-weary country, according to the deal. There are about 2,500 U.S. troops currently in the country. "I urge all parties to choose the path towards peace. The violence must decrease, now," Austin said, in his first press briefing with reporters. "I told our allies that no matter what the outcome of our review, the United States will not undertake a hasty or disorderly withdrawal from Afghanistan," he said referring to this week's virtual NATO meetings. "There will be no surprises. We will consult each other, consult together and decide together and act together," Austin said of the NATO-led mission. A day prior, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the alliance will continue to assess the situation on the ground in Afghanistan. NATO joined the international security effort in Afghanistan in 2003 and currently has more than 7,000 troops in the country. "Our aim is to make sure that we have a lasting political agreement that can make it possible for us to leave in a way that doesn't undermine our main goal and that is to prevent Afghanistan from becoming once again a safe haven [for terrorists]," Stoltenberg said. "The majority of the troops are from European allies and partner countries. We will do what is necessary to make sure that our troops are secure," he said when asked if the alliance was prepared for violence if the agreement with the Taliban is broken. On Capitol Hill, bipartisan lawmakers pressed a panel of experts on Friday that recommend the United States not reduce its military presence in Afghanistan. "Since the U.S. war in Afghanistan began nearly 20 years ago, more than 775,000 of our brave men and women in uniform have deployed to Afghanistan. More than 2,400 have made the ultimate sacrifice, and another 20,000 have been wounded," Rep. Stephen Lynch, chairman of the  Oversight and Reform subcommittee on national security, said in his opening statement. "Nearly 20 years of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan might very well be defined by the next three to six months. Likely with profound consequences for U.S. national security and the future stability of the region," he added. The panel wrote in a report released earlier this month that U.S. troops should keep troops in the war-torn country "in order to give the peace process sufficient time to produce an acceptable result." Read more: Biden should keep U.S. troops in Afghanistan past May deadline, study group says The recommendations from the Afghanistan Study Group , a bipartisan congressionally mandated panel under the United States Institute of Peace, comes as the Biden administration conducts a review of its force posture in the region. "At what point is enough, enough for American engagement in this region?" asked congressman Clay Higgins from Louisiana. "If there's a presence required of American military force, why does that have to include actual boots on the ground?" Former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford, who co-chairs the Afghanistan Study Group, said that U.S. intelligence would deteriorate if the military withdrew from the country. "In order to be effective in conducting counterterrorism, you have to create an ecosystem, if you will, of intelligence and we would not have the networks available to us from an intelligence perspective, we would not have the platform availability, that is the systems that allow us to collect that intelligence, and we wouldn't have the ability to strike quickly with the resources necessary to destroy terrorists once the intelligence develops their location," Dunford, a retired four-star Marine general, told lawmakers. "So, were we to do it from outside of Afghanistan, you would just merely have a geometry problem and responsiveness problem, you would not be as effective," he added. The wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria have cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1.57 trillion since Sept. 11, 2001, according to a Defense Department report . The war in Afghanistan, which is now America's longest conflict, began 19 years ago and has cost U.S. taxpayers $193 billion, according to the Pentagon .
The White House said that it expects to catch up this week on coronavirus vaccine distribution after a sweeping winter storm disrupted logistics. Despite the storms, 2 million of the 6 million delayed vaccines have been delivered. "We expect to rapidly catch up this week, fill that backlog, make sure they're out to communities and also meet our deadlines and our timelines of the doses that are due to go out this upcoming week," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.	WASHINGTON – The White House said Sunday that it expects to catch up this week on coronavirus vaccine distribution after a sweeping winter storm disrupted the administration's colossal logistics . "We knew we can't control mother nature, no one can, but we can certainly contingency plan. What our team has been doing and preparing to do is engage with and work with the Postal Service, work with FedEx and others to get those doses out to vaccination centers and to communities as quickly as they can handle them," explained White House press secretary Jen Psaki on ABC's "This Week" program. "We expect to rapidly catch up this week, fill that backlog, make sure they're out to communities and also meet our deadlines and our timelines of the doses that are due to go out this upcoming week," Psaki said. Psaki added that the administration managed to deliver 2 million of the 6 million vaccines that were delayed. Over the weekend, President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration for Texas as millions across the "Lone Star State" deal with the fallout of severe winter storms. Psaki said that the president plans to visit Texas soon. "He is also very mindful of the fact that it's not a light footprint for a president to travel to a disaster area. He does not want to take away resources or attention. And we're going to do that at an appropriate time in coordination with people on the ground," Psaki said, adding "could be as soon as this week." Last week,  Andy Slavitt, White House senior advisor for Covid response, told reporters that the massive winter storm triggered road closures, power outages as well as staffing shortages at key shipping hubs. "As weather conditions improve, we are already looking to clear this backlog," Slavitt said on Friday, adding that the Covid-19 vaccines were "sitting safe and sound in our factories and hubs ready to be shipped." Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, concurred with Psaki in an interview with NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday. "The number was 6 million doses got delayed. We've gotten two million out, and we project that by the middle of the week, we will have caught up," Fauci said. "Obviously, it is a setback because you'd like to see the steady flow of vaccine getting out there to get into people's arms. But we can play pretty good catch-up," he added. More than 61 million doses of the vaccine have been administered as of Saturday, according to the CDC.   More than 42 million people have received their first dose while more than 17 million people have been fully vaccinated with the two-dose regimen.
"We have begun to communicate with the Iranians on this issue, yes. And we will continue to do so as we go forward," White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said of the five known detained American. When asked for an update on the nuclear talks between Washington and Tehran, Sullivan said that "the ball is in their court."	WASHINGTON – White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Sunday that the United States has started speaking with Iran over detained Americans. "We have begun to communicate with the Iranians on this issue, yes. And we will continue to do so as we go forward," Sullivan said of the five known detained Americans. "Our strong message to the Iranians will be that we will not accept a long-term proposition where they continue to hold Americans in an unjust and unlawful manner," he told CBS on its "Face the Nation" program, adding "It will be a significant priority of this administration to get those Americans safely back home." When asked for an update on the nuclear talks between Washington and Tehran, Sullivan said that "the ball is in their court." Sullivan said that President Joe Biden remains intent on preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and believes the best way to do that is through "clear-eyed diplomacy." "He's prepared to go to the table to talk to the Iranians about how we get strict constraints back on their nuclear program. That offer still stands because we believe diplomacy is the best way to do it. Iran has not yet responded," Sullivan said. Tensions between Washington and Tehran escalated following former President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the landmark nuclear agreement . The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, brokered by the Obama administration, lifted sanctions on Iran that had crippled its economy and cut its oil exports roughly in half. In exchange for sanctions relief, Iran accepted limits on its nuclear program until the terms expire in 2025. The U.S. and its European allies believe Iran has ambitions to develop a nuclear bomb. Tehran has denied that allegation. Trump withdrew the United States from the JCPOA in 2018, calling it the "worst deal ever." Following Washington's exit from the landmark nuclear deal, other signatories of the pact ⁠— France, Germany, the U.K., Russia and China ⁠— tried to keep the agreement alive. Tehran has refused to negotiate while U.S. sanctions remain in place.
Washington and Tehran will ultimately be able to strike a nuclear agreement because Iran needs relief from economic sanctions, according to Richard Goldberg of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The Biden administration last week offered to begin talks with Tehran, but Iran has not agreed, and has stressed that the U.S. must lift sanctions first. "All that you're seeing, all the threats, the terrorism, threats in the Gulf, the seizing of tankers, the nuclear program, taking hostages, these are all various extortion tactics to get money and get sanctions relief," said Goldberg. "That means that a deal is possible."	Washington and Tehran will ultimately be able to strike a nuclear agreement because Iran needs relief from economic sanctions, according to a senior advisor at a U.S. think tank. "I think, ultimately, a deal is possible because the Iranians need money," said Richard Goldberg of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The U.S. and Iran both appear interested to return to the negotiating table, but have not been able to agree on who should make the first move. The Biden administration last week offered to begin talks with Tehran, but Iran has repeatedly stressed that the U.S. must lift sanctions to kickstart the process. Washington has resisted those calls so far. Additionally, Iran's new deal with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is "certainly not helpful" and  falls short of what was previously allowed, Goldberg said. Iran's parliament passed a law that blocks IAEA inspections, but both sides on Sunday said "necessary verification and monitoring activities" will be able to continue for up to three months. Tan Feng Qin of the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute said Iran is aware that preventing inspections could have disadvantages. The three-month reprieve "gives some space and some time for the U.S. and Iran to try to work out the solution to the sequencing problem," he told CNBC's "Capital Connection." Goldberg also remains optimistic that a deal can be reached. "All that you're seeing, all the threats, the terrorism, threats in the Gulf, the seizing of tankers, the nuclear program, taking hostages, these are all various extortion tactics to get money and get sanctions relief," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Monday. "That means that a deal is possible." Iran's foreign ministry did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. Heavy sanctions on Iran — imposed by the Trump administration after it withdrew from the 2015 agreement — have been devastating for Tehran's economy. According to the IMF, the last time Iran saw its GDP grow was in 2017, and the Islamic Republic only had access to $8.8 billion in foreign exchange reserves last year. That's down from $12.7 billion in 2019 and $121.6 billion in 2018. "They are suffering under the sanctions that President Trump imposed, the so-called maximum pressure campaign," Goldberg said. "Clearly, they need access to money, they need sanctions relief, and they want to drive a crisis to try to force Biden's hand to get into some sort of talks that includes sanctions relief," he added. However, questions remain over what the deal will look like. Iran has said that its violations of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) are reversible and can be walked back. But Goldberg disagreed. "There are a lot of steps that are not reversible," he said. "The technical know-how they have acquired testing advanced centrifuges, that is something that we can't put back into the bottle." He also pointed out that the deal came with expiration dates for curbs on Iran's nuclear program. "Since [the JCPOA is] already five years old, we're not into the period where the deal is to Iran's advantage anyway, and so that is a big question mark of whether the Biden administration and their European and Asian allies would want to go back to a deal or simply hold out and negotiate a new deal," he said.
A federal judge ordered the wife of Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman to remain temporarily detained after her arrest at Dulles International Airport on drug charges. Emma Coronel Aispuro, 31, was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and marijuana in the United States. She faces a minimum of 10 years in prison or a maximum of life in prison and a potential fine of $10 million.	WASHINGTON – A federal judge ordered the wife of Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman to remain temporarily detained after her arrest at Dulles International Airport on drug charges. Emma Coronel Aispuro, 31, was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and marijuana in the United States. She faces a minimum of 10 years in prison or a maximum of life in prison and a potential fine of $10 million. Coronel, a former beauty queen, has twin daughters with the Sinaloa cartel boss. The Justice Department also accused her of running her husband's multibillion-dollar cartel. She is a dual citizen of the United States and Mexico. The Justice Department accused Coronel of helping her husband pull off a Houdini-like escape from a Mexican prison in 2015. The Sinaloa cartel boss escaped from a maximum security prison in July 2015 after slipping through a hole in the shower area of his cell. The 1½-foot-by-1½-foot gap in the shower floor led to a custom-built tunnel nearly 30 feet underneath the Altiplano prison complex. The tunnel was 5 feet high and nearly 3 feet wide and equipped with a ventilation system. According to a witness who is now working with the U.S. government, Coronel helped organize the construction of the elaborate escape tunnel with Guzmans sons. The 2015 escape was the second time Mexican authorities lost custody of Guzman. The farmhand turned powerful cartel leader first escaped from prison in 2001. He managed to evade capture for 13 years. After more than six months on the run, Guzman was captured again in 2016 by Mexican authorities. Following his 2016 arrest, the witness told U.S. authorities that Coronel provided a Mexican official with $2 million to oversee Guzman's transfer from one prison to another. According to U.S. attorneys, Coronel ordered the transfer so that a new escape could be facilitated. The drug boss was never transferred. A year later, he was extradited to the United States. After a three-month trial in 2019, the narco kingpin was sentenced to life in prison.
Defense spending across the oil-rich Gulf states — among the top buyers of U.S. arms globally — is expected to drop by nearly 10% in 2021 after increasing significantly the previous year. In 2018, defense intelligence firm Jane's expected Gulf defense spending to increase consistently over the coming years and top $110 billion by 2023. The UAE and other Gulf states, namely Saudi Arabia, are pouring money into developing their own indigenous defense industries	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Defense spending across the oil-rich Gulf states — among the top buyers of U.S. arms globally — is expected to drop by nearly 10% in 2021 after increasing significantly the previous year. That's thanks to tighter budgets due to the fall in oil prices over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, defense intelligence firm Jane's said in a new report. "Defence spending in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries is to decline by 9.4% in 2021, as countries in the region face pressure due to the impact of Covid-19 and low oil prices," Jane's wrote in a report published Friday, adding that it "expects a swift rebound in coming years" — but no return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024. That's a striking change for the wealthiest countries in a region whose arms imports increased by 61% between 2015 and 2019, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). "The significant drop in oil prices during 2020, coupled with a corresponding decline in demand from the manufacturing and transportation sectors, resulted in increased pressure on government budgets," Charles Forrester, lead analyst at Jane's, said in the report. He noted the decline of oil and gas revenues, as well as the fall in revenues from non-oil sectors like tourism, finance and travel as a result of countrywide lockdowns. In 2018, the firm expected Gulf defense spending to increase consistently over the coming years and top $110 billion by 2023. Defense expenditure jumped by 5.4% in 2020 from the previous year to $100 billion, but is projected to drop to $90.6 billion this year and $89.4 billion in 2022. The report came ahead of IDEX, the Middle East's largest defense expo, taking place in Abu Dhabi this week. Despite the pandemic, IDEX was still busy with participants. Ahead of the event, organizers expected more than 70,000 attendees and 900 exhibitors from some 60 countries to gather at the Emirati capital throughout the week to display their newest technologies and broker deals in a region that accounted for 35% of total global arms imports in the last five years, according to SIPRI. Absent at the arms fair was an official Israeli delegation, despite the country's historic normalization and rapid warming of ties with the UAE after the signing of the Abraham Accords in September. Talk of defense and technology cooperation has abounded since then, but a surge in Israel's Covid-19 cases prompted the country's leadership to shut down its main airport, halting international travel. Still, Israel for the first time ever had a pavilion set up at IDEX, and though Israelis themselves were unable to travel to the conference, numerous Israeli companies had displays up and some were occupied by local staff. Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd, UVision Air Ltd, and Israel Weapon Industries Ltd were among those with exhibitor stands, some even showing off new unmanned aerial vehicles. Israel's head of mission in Abu Dhabi, Eitan Na'eh, visited the country's section, as did UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. While the UAE and Israel are believed to have had quiet security dealings for years, their ability to publicly seek partnerships and deals in the defense sector is unprecedented. The advent of diplomatic relations with Israel means new technologies and more competition for the Gulf market, offering greater options for equipment that's still compatible with that already purchased from the West. One big question mark remains the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jet, for which the UAE inked a $23 billion purchase in the final days of the Trump presidency. It would become the first Arab country to get the highly advanced and secretive system, greenlighted in the aftermath of its accord with Israel. Israel's military already flies the jets; the UAE's acquisition "will help to link the U.S., Israeli, and Emirati defence industries together," the Jane's report said. But the sale is currently on hold pending review by the administration of Joe Biden , who has shown far more restraint in his relationship with the Gulf states so far compared to his predecessor, who circumvented Congress to push through large arms deals with the UAE, Saudi Arabia and others. This is seen as one of many reasons the UAE and other Gulf states, namely Saudi Arabia, are pouring money into developing their own indigenous defense industries — aiming to increase their self-sufficiency, grow local jobs and compete in their own right as arms exporters. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE, with the help of state-owned entities like Saudi Arabian Military Industries and the Emiratis' EDGE, "are also working to leverage new technologies in the defence sector — in order to build out their own conventional deterrence capabilities and to reduce the reliance on foreign suppliers," Forrester said. Those technologies include armored vehicles, naval vessels, smart missiles, electronic warfare capabilities, and unmanned systems including aerial drones, EDGE CEO Faisal Al Bannai told CNBC at the expo on Monday. EDGE is an advanced technology group that consists of 25 Emirati companies and ranks among the top 25 arms suppliers in the world. "As these solutions start evolving and maturing, for sure the local client at least prefers to buy local sovereign products, because it has more flexibility and it can meet its needs in the much shorter term," he told CNBC's Hadley Gamble. The CEO aims to see the UAE's firms competing at the international as well as regional level. "I can definitely see, as you grow your capabilities, as the needs keep increasing, I think it's only good for local industry and for local talent to grow such capabilities," he said.
President Biden's nominee to run the CIA told lawmakers Wednesday that if confirmed he would intensify America's national security approach to counter China. William Burns, 64, who worked under both Republican and Democratic presidents, described Xi Jinping's China as "a formidable, authoritarian adversary." His confirmation is expected to easily pass with strong bipartisan support similar to the majority of Biden's national security team.	WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden 's nominee to run the CIA told lawmakers Wednesday that if confirmed he would intensify America's national security approach to counter China. "Out-competing China will be key to our national security in the days ahead," Will Burns said in his opening remarks to the Senate Intelligence Committee. "That will require a long-term, clear-eyed, bipartisan strategy, underpinned by domestic renewal and solid intelligence," the former career diplomat added. Burns, 64, who has worked under both Republican and Democratic presidents, described Xi Jinping 's China as "a formidable, authoritarian adversary." He added that China was "methodically strengthening its capabilities to steal intellectual property, repress its own people, bully its neighbors, expand its global reach, and build influence in American society." Burns' comments come as the Biden administration faces cool relations with China. In his first phone call with Chinese President Xi , Biden raised his "fundamental concerns" about Beijing's "coercive and unfair economic practices, crackdown in Hong Kong, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and increasingly assertive actions in the region, including Taiwan." Over the past four years, the Trump administration blamed China for a wide range of grievances, including intellectual property theft, unfair trade practices and recently, the coronavirus pandemic . Biden previously said his strategy toward China would be different from his predecessor's unilateral approach, pledging to work closely with allies in order to push back against Beijing. "We will confront China's economic abuses," Biden explained in a speech at the State Department, describing that nation as America's "most serious competitor." "But we're also ready to work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so. We'll compete from a position of strength by building back better at home and working with our allies and partners." Burns, who was introduced to the Senate committee by former Secretary of State James Baker and former CIA Director and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, previously served as U.S. ambassador to Jordan and Russia. His confirmation is expected to easily pass with strong bipartisan support similar to the majority of Biden's national security team. Earlier this month, the Senate confirmed Alejandro Mayorkas to lead the nation's Department of Homeland Security , making him the first Latino to hold the role. The Senate voted 56 to 43. Last month, the Senate confirmed Avril Haines as director of national intelligence with an 84 to 10 vote, making her the first official member of Biden's Cabinet. Haines is also the first woman to lead the nation's 18 intelligence agencies. The Senate voted 93 to 2 to confirm Lloyd Austin as the next Pentagon chief , making him the nation's first Black Defense secretary. The Senate confirmed Biden's top diplomat Antony Blinken in a 78 to 22 vote, making him the nation's next secretary of State.
The director generals of military operations for India and Pakistan held discussions where they reviewed the situation along the Line of Control. The Line of Control is the de facto border separating the two nuclear-armed rivals in the mountainous region of Kashmir. Pakistan and India both lay claim to the full area but control only parts of it.	India and Pakistan issued a joint statement saying both sides have agreed to stop firing along their disputed border in Kashmir starting Thursday. The director generals of military operations for the two countries held discussions where they reviewed the situation along the Line of Control – the de facto border between the Indian and Pakistani parts of Kashmir – in a "free, frank and cordial atmosphere," according to the statement posted by India. Frequent clashes and cross-border shelling along the Line of Control in recent months reportedly killed multiple civilians . "In the interest of achieving mutually beneficial and sustainable peace along the borders, the two (director generals) agreed to address each other's core issues and concerns which have propensity to disturb peace and lead to violence," the statement read. It added that both sides will utilize existing mechanisms including a hotline to resolve tensions and misunderstandings. Kashmir has always been a contentious issue for the two nuclear-armed rivals. Pakistan and India both lay claim to the full area but control only parts of it. They have fought multiple wars over the mountainous region. In 2019, tensions escalated when both countries carried out retaliatory airstrikes against one another , prompting worries of a war breaking out in South Asia. Since then, India stripped the state of Jammu & Kashmir of its special status that allowed it to make its own laws and turned the state into the union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. Pakistan criticized the move . This week, Indian media reported that Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said at a conference in Sri Lanka that Kashmir is the only dispute his country has with India and that it can only be resolved through dialogue. Separately, India responded at the 46th Session of the U.N. Human Rights Council on Wednesday, where it said that Pakistan has "one of the world's worst human rights records," and that it should "put its own house in order, before venturing to point a finger at India."
Some Senate Democrats on Friday criticized President Biden's decision not to confer with all members of Congress prior to launching airstrikes in Syria. Sen. Tim Kaine requested a briefing from the Biden administration about the decision behind Thursday's airstrikes. The Pentagon briefed congressional leadership before the action last night, according to a National Security Council spokesman, who said there will be a full classified briefing early next week.	Some Senate Democrats on Friday criticized President Joe Biden's decision to launch an airstrike Thursday night in Syria without conferring with all of Congress. The Pentagon briefed congressional leadership before the action, according to a National Security Council spokesman. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's staff was notified before the strike, according to a Democratic aide. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., on Friday requested a briefing from the Biden administration on the decision-making behind the airstrikes. "The American people deserve to hear the Administration's rationale for these strikes and its legal justification for acting without coming to Congress. Offensive military action without congressional approval is not constitutional absent extraordinary circumstances," a statement from Kaine's office read. Kaine is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. There will be a full classified briefing early next week, the NSC spokesman said. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., the chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee, also called for transparency. "Congress should hold this administration to the same standard it did prior administrations, and require clear legal justifications for military action, especially inside theaters like Syria, where Congress has not explicitly authorized any American military action," Murphy said in a statement Friday. A representative for Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate's top Democrat, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Biden on Thursday directed U.S. military airstrikes in eastern Syria against facilities belonging to what the Pentagon said were Iran-backed militia, in response to recent rocket attacks against U.S. targets in Iraq. In a Feb. 15 attack, rockets hit the U.S. military base at Irbil in the Kurdish-run region, killing one non-American contractor and injuring a number of American contractors and a U.S. service member. Another salvo struck a base hosting U.S. forces north of Baghdad days later, hurting at least one contractor. On Monday, rockets hit Baghdad's Green Zone, which houses the U.S. Embassy and other diplomatic missions. "It's difficult to say with any certainty whether there's a strategic calculation driving this ... recent uptick in attacks or whether this is just a continuation of the sorts of attacks we've seen in the past," Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a briefing Monday. "We will hold Iran responsible by the attacks, by the provocations of its proxies," State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a separate briefing Monday. The rocket attack in Irbil "remains under active investigation," he said. The U.S. airstrikes Thursday garnered Biden some rare praise from the other side of the aisle. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., thanked Biden for the move. In 2018, then-President Donald Trump ordered military strikes in Syria. The move also prompted criticism from Democrats. "The President must come to Congress and secure an Authorization for Use of Military Force by proposing a comprehensive strategy with clear objectives that keep our military safe," Pelosi tweeted at the time. — Reuters contributed to this report.
The White House defended its decision to not target Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after a U.S. intelligence report linked the royal to the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi, a 59-year-old U.S. resident and a widely known critic of the Saudi royal family, was killed inside the Saudi Consulate and later dismembered. His remains were never recovered. The Saudis are the indisputable top buyers of U.S.-made arms, a title that has safeguarded the kingdom from retaliatory sanctions under the Trump administration over the disappearance of journalist Khashoggi and the Saudi-led war in Yemen.	WASHINGTON – The White House on Sunday defended its decision to not target Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after a U.S. intelligence report linked the royal to the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. "Historically and even in recent history, Democratic and Republican administrations, there have not been sanctions put in place for the leaders of foreign governments where we have diplomatic relations and even where we don't have diplomatic relations," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during an interview on CNN's "State of the Union" program. "We believe there are more effective ways to make sure that this doesn't happen again and also to leave room to work with the Saudis on areas where there is mutual agreement," Psaki said. "That is what diplomacy looks like. That is what a complicated global engagement looks like and we've made no secret and have been clear that we are going to hold them accountable on the global stage," Psaki said, adding that the administration took steps through the Treasury and State Department. When he was running for president, Joe Biden said he would hold senior Saudi leaders accountable for Khashoggi's death, calling the kingdom's leadership a "pariah" that had "very little social redeeming value." On Friday, Treasury slapped sanctions on the crown prince's security detail, known as the Rapid Intervention Force. It also sanctioned the former deputy head of the kingdom's intelligence service, Ahmad Hassan Mohammed al-Asiri, who is accused of being a ringleader in the plot. Meanwhile, the State Department imposed visa restrictions on 76 Saudi individuals "believed to have been engaged in threatening dissidents overseas, including but not limited to the Khashoggi killing." Khashoggi, a 59-year-old U.S. resident and a widely known critic of the Saudi royal family, went to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018. He never emerged following the scheduled appointment. He was killed inside the Saudi government building and later dismembered. His remains were never recovered. When asked if the Biden administration would take further action, Psaki said that the United States would recalibrate its relationship with Saudi Arabia in the wake of the Trump administration. Earlier this month, Biden announced the end of U.S. support for offensive operations in Yemen . Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have carried out attacks in Yemen against the Houthis. The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen had previously enjoyed the backing of former President Donald Trump's administration. And last month, Biden halted sales of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia in order to assess potential human rights abuses. On the campaign trail, then-Vice President Biden criticized then-President Donald Trump's refusal to address the kingdom's human rights abuses and eagerness to sell the royals more American-made weapons. "I would make it very clear that we are not going to in fact sell more weapons to them, we were going to in fact make them pay the price," Biden said during a Democratic presidential debate. "They have to be held accountable" he added. Saudi Arabia's oil-rich monarchy is one of America's most strategic partners and a significant patron of U.S. defense companies. The Saudis are the top buyer of U.S.-made arms , a title that has safeguarded the kingdom from retaliatory sanctions over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Despite reports that Saudi Arabia was behind the attack, Trump said in a lengthy statement that the United States would stand with Saudi Arabia. Throughout his presidency, Trump often cited the importance of America's relationship with Saudi Arabia, repeatedly pushing back on approving significant economic or political consequences for Riyadh's human rights abuses. Trump has also previously said that the U.S. defense industry would be negatively impacted if his administration were to sanction the Saudis over the Khashoggi killing. "I tell you what I don't want to do," Trump said to CBS' "60 Minutes," when he was asked about possibly blocking arms sales to Riyadh. "Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, all these [companies]. I don't want to hurt jobs. I don't want to lose an order like that. There are other ways of punishing, to use a word that's a pretty harsh word, but it's true," he said one month after Khashoggi's disappearance.

Instead, Biden  and will conduct relations through the crown prince's aging father, King Salman, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken will conduct relations through the foreign minister.
Iran rejected on Sunday an invitation from global partners of the 2015 nuclear deal to discuss the regime's potential return to the negotiating table. The Biden administration has previously said that it wants Iran to return to the nuclear deal but won't suspend sanctions until Tehran comes back into compliance. Tehran has refused to negotiate while U.S. sanctions remain in place. The White House said that the Biden administration was disappointed with Iran's decision to skip the informal meeting with the U.S. and the other signatories of the 2015 pact ⁠— France, Germany, the U.K., Russia and China.	WASHINGTON – Iran rejected on Sunday an invitation from global powers who signed the 2015 nuclear deal to discuss the regime's potential return to the negotiating table, a significant setback in the Biden administration's efforts to revive the agreement. "Considering the recent actions and statements by the United States and three European powers, Iran does not consider this the time to hold an informal meeting with these countries, which was proposed by the EU foreign policy chief," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said, according to Tehran's state-run media. The White House said on Sunday that the Biden administration was disappointed with Iran's decision to skip the informal meeting with the U.S. and the other signatories of the 2015 pact ⁠— France, Germany, the U.K., Russia and China. "While we are disappointed at Iran's response, we remain ready to reengage in meaningful diplomacy to achieve a mutual return to compliance with JCPOA commitments," a senior administration official told NBC News.  "We will be consulting with our P5+1 partners on the best way forward," said the official, referring to the five permanent U.N. Security Council members and Germany. The Biden administration has previously said that it wants to revive the nuclear deal but won't suspend sanctions until Tehran comes back into compliance . Tehran has refused to negotiate while U.S. sanctions remain in place. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), brokered by the Obama administration, lifted sanctions on Iran that had crippled its economy and cut its oil exports roughly in half. In exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief, Iran agreed to dismantle some of its nuclear program and open its facilities to more extensive international inspections. The U.S. and its European allies believe Iran has ambitions to develop a nuclear bomb. Tehran has denied that allegation. In 2018, then-President Donald Trump kept a campaign promise and withdrew the United States from the JCPOA calling it the "worst deal ever." Following Washington's exit from the landmark nuclear deal, other signatories of the pact ⁠have tried to keep the agreement alive. In a letter released Sunda ', Republican senators warned President Joe Biden to not rejoin the 2015 nuclear agreement because it is "riddled with problems," and instead pushed for a more comprehensive deal. "The scope of any agreement with Iran must address the full range of Iranian conduct, including regional terrorism, ballistic missiles, and the detention of U.S. nationals. It comes as no surprise that Iran's proxies support Assad's ongoing atrocities in Syria, attack our troops and diplomats in Iraq, have driven Lebanon to the brink of collapse, threaten our Israeli and Gulf partners, and contribute to the world's largest humanitarian disaster in Yemen," wrote Sens. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, Jim Risch of Idaho, Marco Rubio of Florida, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio in a joint letter to Biden . "Despite criticism of the 'maximum pressure' campaign, there is no denying that it has inflicted a cost on Iran for its malign activities and now presents your administration with leverage to obtain a better deal from Iran. We know that Iran cannot be trusted to honor its commitments," the senators wrote. Washington's strained relationship with Tehran took several turns for the worse under the Trump administration. Last year, the U.S. carried out an airstrike that killed Qasem Soleimani, Iran's top military commander. Iran retaliated by launching at least a dozen missiles from its territory on Jan. 7 at two military bases in Iraq that house U.S. troops and coalition forces. A day later from the White House, Trump said that Iran appeared "to be standing down" and warned Tehran to abandon its nuclear ambitions. On the heels of the deadly U.S. strike, Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the Trump administration had committed an "act of terror ." Soleimani's death led the regime to further scale back compliance with the international nuclear pact. In January 2020, Iran said it would no longer limit its uranium enrichment capacity or nuclear research . In October, the United States unilaterally re-imposed U.N. sanctions on Tehran through a snapback process, which other U.N. Security Council members have previously said Washington does not have the authority to execute because it withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018. A month later, a top Iranian nuclear scientist was assassinated near Tehran, which led Iran's government to allege that Israel was behind the attack with U.S. backing. During the summer of 2019, a string of attacks in the Persian Gulf set the U.S. and Iran on a path toward greater confrontation. In June, U.S. officials said an Iranian surface-to-air missile shot down an American military surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz. Iran said the aircraft was over its territory. That strike came a week after the U.S. blamed Iran for attacks on two oil tankers in the Persian Gulf region and after four tankers were attacked in May. The U.S. that June slapped new sanctions on Iranian military leaders blamed for shooting down the drone. The measures also aimed to block financial resources for Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. Tensions soared again in September of 2019 when the U.S. blamed Iran for strikes in Saudi Arabia on the world's largest crude processing plant and oil field. That attack forced the kingdom to cut its production operations in half and triggered the largest spike in crude prices in decades and renewed concerns of a new war in the Middle East. Iran maintains that it was not behind the attacks.
The United States sanctioned seven members of the Russian government for last year's alleged poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny. In September, the German government said that the 44-year-old Russian dissident was poisoned by a chemical nerve agent, describing the toxicology report as providing "unequivocal evidence." The Kremlin has repeatedly denied having a role in Navalny's poisoning.	WASHINGTON – The United States sanctioned seven members of the Russian government for the alleged poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny and his subsequent arrest and detention in Moscow. Washington also imposed sanctions on 14 entities involved in the chemical and biological industrial base in Russia, senior administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Tuesday. Russia's military intelligence wing, known as the GRU, and Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, were sanctioned for their alleged role in the poisoning. The GosNIIOKhT, 33rd TsNIII and the 27th Scientific Center were also sanctioned for developing Russia's chemical weapons capabilities. "The Kremlin's use of chemical weapons to silence a political opponent and intimidate others demonstrates its flagrant disregard for international norms," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrote in a statement. "We join the EU in condemning Alexei Navalny's poisoning as well as his arrest and imprisonment by the Russian government," she added. Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote in a separate statement that the sanctions would "send a clear signal" to Russia that use of chemical weapons and human rights abuses carry hefty consequences. "Any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable and contravenes international norms," Blinken wrote. Navalny, a leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, flew to Russia from Berlin , where he spent nearly half a year recovering for a nerve agent poisoning that took place last August. He was arrested at passport control and later sentenced to more than two years in prison . Last summer, Navalny was medically evacuated to Germany from a Russian hospital after he became ill following reports that something was added to his tea. Russian doctors treating Navalny denied that the Kremlin critic had been poisoned and blamed his comatose state on low blood sugar levels. In September, the German government said that the 44-year-old Russian dissident was poisoned by a chemical nerve agent, describing the toxicology report as providing " unequivocal evidence. " The nerve agent was in the family of Novichok, which was developed by the Soviet Union . Toxicology tests conducted in France and Sweden also came to the same conclusion. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied having a role in Navalny's poisoning. At the White House, press secretary Jen Psaki said that the sanctions were coordinated with the European Union and that the Biden adminsitration "expects the relationship with Russia to continue to be a challenge." "We are neither seeking to reset our relations with Russia nor are we seeking to escalate. There is also an ongoing process to consider a number of steps of concerning behavior taken by the Russians," Psaki added. The sanctions are the first to target Russia since Joe Biden became president. They also come as the White House reviews other maligned Russian actions including the SolarWinds hack, reports of Russian bounties on American troops in Afghanistan and potential election interference. The Trump administration did not take action against Russia over the Navalny situation. The European Union first took action against Moscow for the poisoning of Navalny in October when the body announced travel restrictions and froze assets of six Russian individuals. In solidarity with the United States, the European Union announced new sanctions against Russia. Ahead of the sanctions announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that the measures against Russia would further deteriorate relations between Moscow and Washington.
The Pentagon confirmed that nearly a dozen rockets struck an Iraqi base hosting U.S. troops. It said the Iraqi military is investigating. Wednesday's attack on Al-Asad comes on the heels of Biden's order to strike Iran-aligned militia targets in Syria.	The Pentagon on Wednesday confirmed that nearly a dozen rockets struck an Iraqi base hosting U.S. troops. The initial report, tweeted by Army spokesman Col. Wayne Marotto, said 10 "indirect fire" rockets hit Ain al-Asad airbase in Anbar province, where some of the 2,500 U.S. forces in Iraq are based. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said no U.S service members were injured in the attack. He added that "a U.S. civilian contractor suffered a cardiac episode while sheltering and sadly passed away shortly after." The Pentagon said the Iraqi military is handling the investigation. "Let's let our Iraqi partners investigate, see what they learn. And then if a response is warranted, I think we have shown clearly that we won't shy away from that. We are just not there yet," a Pentagon spokesperson said when asked if the U.S. will respond to the attacks with military action. The Biden administration was briefed on the attack overnight and has "reached out to field and military to assess the damage and check on personnel," a White House official told NBC News. Wednesday's attack on Ain al-Asad comes on the heels of Biden's decision to strike Iran-aligned militia targets in Syria. Those strikes in Syria were seen as a retaliatory effort against the Feb. 15 rocket attack in Erbil. Two days later, the Biden administration had hinted at retaliation . "It is fair to say that there will be consequences for any group responsible for this attack," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters at the time. The skirmishes could upset what the Biden administration considers a foreign policy priority: a return to the Iranian nuclear deal reached during the Obama administration with several world powers. The agreement lifted economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs to its nuclear program. The deal has all but collapsed since the Trump administration unilaterally ditched it in 2018 and reimposed sweeping sanctions on Iran that have crippled its economy. -CNBC's Natasha Turak contributed to this report.
Dr. Anthony Fauci said Thursday that U.S. service members who are eligible but opt out of taking the coronavirus vaccine are "inadvertently being part of the problem" of lengthening the pandemic. "You've got to think of your own health, which is really very important, but you got to think about your societal obligation," Fauci said. Last month, the Pentagon acknowledged that approximately one-third of U.S. military service members declined to take the voluntary coronavirus vaccine.	WASHINGTON – White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Thursday that U.S. service members who are eligible to get the Covid-19 vaccine but opt out are inadvertently "part of the problem" of lengthening the pandemic. "You're part of the solution to this outbreak," explained Fauci to a virtual audience during a town hall with Blue Star Families, a non-profit dedicated to issues facing military families. "Because by getting infected, even though you may not know it, you may be inadvertently transmitting the infection to someone else, even though you have no symptoms," Fauci said. "In reality, like it or not, you're propagating this outbreak. So instead of being part of the solution, you are innocently and inadvertently being part of the problem by not getting vaccinated." "You've got to think of your own health, which is really very important, but you got to think about your societal obligation, including people close to you personally as well as other members of families of other individuals," Fauci said. Last month, the Pentagon acknowledged that about one-third of U.S. military service members declined to take the voluntary coronavirus vaccine. When asked if military leadership were disappointed with the revelation, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters last month that the decision to take the vaccine was ultimately up to each member of the force. "Everybody is different and we want — what the secretary wants — is for the men and women of the department to make the best and most informed decision for them and for their health and the health of their families," Kirby said, adding that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin did get the vaccine. Meanwhile, the military's U.S. Northern Command, which is responsible for the Pentagon's coronavirus efforts, has tasked thousands of service members to help vaccinate communities across the nation. Last week, Austin embarked on his first official trip since ascending to the top spot at the Pentagon to meet with military commanders overseeing the Covid-19 response effort in California. Austin also visited a FEMA vaccination center in Los Angeles, the first staffed by both active-duty military teams as well as National Guard personnel. Austin said the Pentagon has prioritized getting factual information out to the force in order to bolster confidence. "There's a degree of mistrust and I think we have to collectively work hard to dispel rumors and to provide facts to people," Austin told reporters traveling with him. "And it's been my experience that when armed with the facts, people will tend to make the right decisions." "My counsel to everyone is, I mean, this saves lives. And it's not just about saving our life, it's about saving our partner's life, our neighbor's life, and in the military, you know, we thrive on teamwork and we have to think about our teammates, as well," he added.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said those responsible for carrying out last week's rocket attack against an Iraqi base that hosts American troops will be held accountable. "The message to those that would carry out such an attack is that expect us to do what is necessary to defend ourselves," Austin said in an interview with ABC that aired on Sunday. Also on Sunday, the U.S. military's Central Command, which oversees the wars in the Middle East, flew its fourth bomber deployment to the region.	WASHINGTON – Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin warned those responsible for carrying out last week's rocket attack against an Iraqi base that hosts American troops will be held to account. "The message to those that would carry out such an attack is that expect us to do what is necessary to defend ourselves," Austin said in an interview with ABC that aired on Sunday. "We'll strike if that's what we think we need to do at a time and place of our own choosing. We demand the right to protect our troops," he said, adding that the U.S. is still assessing intelligence with its Iraqi partners. Defense officials have previously said the attack had typical hallmarks of a strike by Iran-backed groups. Iran has denied involvement. When asked if Iran would view a potential U.S. response as an escalation of tensions, the new Pentagon chief and retired Army four-star reiterated that Washington would do whatever is necessary to protect Americans and U.S. interests in the region. "What they [Iranians] should draw from this, again, is that we're going to defend our troops and our response will be thoughtful. It will be appropriate," Austin said. "We would hope that they would choose to do the right things," he added. On Sunday, the U.S. military's Central Command, which oversees the wars in the Middle East, flew its fourth bomber deployment to the region. The show of force mission included two B-52H Stratofortress bombers alongside aircraft from Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar at different points to "deter aggression and reassure partners and allies of the U.S. military's commitment to security in the region." Last month, Iran rejected an invitation from global powers who signed the 2015 nuclear deal to discuss the regime's potential return to the negotiating table, a significant setback in the Biden administration's efforts to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.

All the while, Iran maintains that it was not behind the attacks.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention administered 5.3 million vaccines over the weekend, according to the agency's latest tally. Several states are dropping mask mandates and loosening economic restrictions as vaccinations increase and Covid infections decrease. Public health officials warn premature re-openings could lead to another Covid surge as new variants emerge, undermining the progress made.	WASHINGTON – The United States administered a record number of Covid-19 vaccines over the weekend as public health officials call on state leaders to keep social distancing measures in place in order to avoid a new surge that could undermine progress in fighting the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention administered 2.9 million vaccines on Saturday, a record, and 2.4 million on Sunday, according to the agency's latest tally . The numbers are subject to revisions as more data becomes available to public health officials. More than one in five adults have now received at least one vaccine dose, while just over one in ten have received two doses, according to the CDC. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines require two injections while the recently approved Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires one. Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, told NBC's "Meet The Press" on Sunday that the nation is now administering more than 2 million shots a day on average, compared to 900,000 daily injections on average during the early days of the vaccination campaign. President Joe Biden said last week that the U.S. would have enough vaccine doses for every adult by the end of May, two months earlier than expected . However, Zients cautioned that while progress has been made in ramping up vaccinations, the nation needs to double down on mitigation measures for now. "We're on a path — we need to make sure that we do not let down our guard," Zients said. "People do need to meet the president's challenge of masking up. People do need to take the vaccine when it's their turn. We need to stay on this path and beat this pandemic." Zients joins a chorus of public health officials warning the nation to stay on guard as several states drop mask mandates and loosen other coronavirus restrictions as cases decline and vaccinations increase. Last week, Arizona, Texas, Alabama, South Carolina, California and Mississippi all relaxed restrictions to varying degrees. Arizona's governor ended capacity limits on businesses but said they must still require masks. Texas also announced a return to full capacity businesses but dropped its mask mandate. Alabama's governor said the state would lift its mask mandate after April 9 . South Carolina lifted the state's mask mandate in government buildings but recommended that restaurants continue to require face coverings. California will allow theme parks, outdoor sports and live events at stadiums to restart on April 1 with reduced capacity and mandatory masks. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday the state would allow restaurants outside New York City to return to 75% capacity. Mississippi also announced last week that businesses could operate at full capacity and dropped the state's mask mandate. On Sunday, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves responded to criticism from public health officials that his decision to ease Covid restrictions was premature. "Our approach has been to not only protect lives but to also protect livelihoods. We need to get our economy rolling so that individuals can get back to work," Reeves said in an interview with CNN's "State of the Union." White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Americans to still be vigilant and adhere to public health measures as the administration works to vaccinate the nation. "We do want to come back carefully and slowly," Fauci said on CBS News "Face the Nation" program. "But don't turn the switch on and off because it really would be risky to have yet again another surge," Fauci said of states altering mitigation methods. Similarly, Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said on NBC's "Meet the Press" program that the U.S. may see an uptick in cases due to the new variants. Osterholm explained on Sunday that the U.S. is "in the eye of the hurricane right now." Osterholm said the prevalence of the more infectious B.1.1.7. variant, which was first identified in the U.K., will continue to grow. He added that approximately 40% of cases across the nation are linked to the variant. Though new Covid infections continue to decline from the catastrophic winter peak, they remain stubbornly high at more than 60,000 new cases a day on average, according to a CNBC analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. That's comparable to the surge the U.S. experienced last summer. Deaths have also decreased from the devastating winter peak, but remain tragically high. More than 1,700 people are dying a day from the virus on average, according to data from Johns Hopkins.
The Pentagon said Monday that it has not decided whether to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan. "There hasn't been a decision made yet about future force posture in Afghanistan," said Pentagon press secretary John Kirby. The war in Afghanistan, which is now America's longest conflict, began 19 years ago and has cost U.S. taxpayers $193 billion, according to the Pentagon.	WASHINGTON — The Pentagon said Monday that it has not decided whether to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, as Washington considers a potential end to America's longest war. "Everybody here is mindful of looming deadlines," Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters during a press briefing. "And I cannot today sketch out for you what specific planning is going on when there hasn't been a decision made yet about future force posture in Afghanistan," he said. In February 2020 the United States brokered a deal with the Taliban that would usher in a permanent cease-fire and reduced further the U.S. military's footprint from approximately 13,000 troops to 8,600 by mid-July last year. By May 2021, all foreign forces would leave the war-weary country, according to the deal. There are about 2,500 U.S. troops currently in the country. Last month, the world's most powerful military alliance met to discuss an array of challenges facing the 30-member group. High on the agenda was the path forward in Afghanistan. NATO joined the international security effort in Afghanistan in 2003 and currently has more than 7,000 troops in the country. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance will continue to assess the situation on the ground in Afghanistan. "Our aim is to make sure that we have a lasting political agreement that can make it possible for us to leave in a way that doesn't undermine our main goal and that is to prevent Afghanistan from becoming once again a safe haven [for terrorists]," Stoltenberg said. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told reporters on the heels of the NATO meeting that the U.S. troop drawdown in Afghanistan would be contingent on a reduction of violence in the country. "The violence must decrease, now," Austin said, in his first press briefing with reporters . "I told our allies that no matter what the outcome of our review, the United States will not undertake a hasty or disorderly withdrawal from Afghanistan," he said, referring to the virtual NATO meetings. "There will be no surprises. We will consult each other, consult together and decide together and act together," Austin said of the NATO-led mission.

President Joe Biden last month announced that the U.S. will be cutting its support for offensive operations in Yemen. Biden's move will not help to end the war in Yemen because the U.S. will not have concessions to offer to the Houthi rebels, according to Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president for research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.	U.S. President Joe Biden wants to end the war in Yemen, but it's not likely that the conflict can be dialed back anytime soon, according to Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president for research at the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "In fact, if anything, I think this is likely to make the conflict grow worse," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Tuesday. Biden announced last month that the U.S. will withdraw its support for the offensive against the Houthi forces in Yemen. Previous administrations under Donald Trump and Barack Obama backed the Saudi-led alliance in its intervention in the civil war in Yemen. Yemen's civil war began in 2014 when Houthi rebels took control of the capital Sanaa from the internationally recognized Yemeni government. A year later, Saudi Arabia led a coalition of Sunni Arab states in support of the Yemeni government to oust the Houthis, a militia backed by Shiite-majority Iran. According to the United Nations , the war has already caused an estimated 233,000 deaths — including more than 100,000 fatalities from indirect causes such as lack of food, health services and infrastructure. Schanzer said Biden's move will not help end the war in Yemen because the U.S. does not have concessions to offer to the Houthis, who now have less incentive than before to make compromises. "What the Biden administration has done is, it has taken the military option off the table for the United States, even by way of proxy through the Saudis," he said. The U.S. also removed the Houthis from being designated as a foreign terrorist organization , and took them off the Specially Designated Global Terrorist list. "What is left right now is diplomacy," Schanzer said. "The reality that we are now facing is that we've taken really all of our other leverage off the table, and we're simply going to hope that an Iran-backed militia will come to the table and act reasonably," he said. "Unfortunately, I think this is wishful thinking." He noted that the Houthis have stepped up strikes even though the U.S. special envoy to Yemen, Timothy Lenderking, has implored them to negotiate. Schanzer said Saudi Arabia's continued military operations could be "one of the few pieces of leverage" that the U.S. could use in discussions with the Houthis. Still, he acknowledged that there is an aversion to being involved in the conflict. "It looks … as if the Biden administration has itself tied in knots a bit," he said. It's unlikely that there will be progress toward ending the Yemen war for now, he said, pointing to the aggression from the Houthis. "With the swarm drone attacks and the ballistic missile attacks and other acts of violence they've carried out in the Saudi state, it's very, very hard to imagine that the Saudis are going to want to dial back on their reprisals," he said. — CNBC's Amanda Macias contributed to this report.
Boeing logged orders for 82 new aircraft in February and had 51 cancellations. The manufacturer delivered 22 planes including 18 737 Max jetliners. The Covid-19 pandemic continues to weigh on sales of new planes.	Boeing sold 82 aircraft in February and logged 51 cancellations, marking the first time since November 2019 that monthly sales outpaced scrapped orders. The Covid-19 pandemic continues to weigh on sales of new planes as airlines largely try to conserve cash wherever they can. Some carriers, however, are starting to prepare for a recovery in travel demand by buying new planes. Boeing's February sales included 25 Boeing 737 Max planes to United Airlines and 27 KC-46 tankers. The Chicago-based aircraft manufacturer posted 51 cancellations, including 32 Max planes. Singapore Airlines replaced an order for 19 787-10 Dreamliners with one for 11 777X jets, Boeing's long-delayed new plane. The company expects that twin-aisle, long-range jet to enter commercial service in late 2023. Boeing's backlog now stands at 4,041 planes. Boeing delivered 22 aircraft last month, including 18 737 Max planes. The Federal Aviation Administration in November cleared the jets to fly again after a 20-month grounding that followed two deadly crashes. Most other aviation regulators have followed suit, allowing Boeing to resume deliveries of the more than 3,000 Max planes it has had on backorder.
The USPS in February awarded the first part of the 10-year, multibillion-dollar contract to update the postal delivery vehicle fleet to Oshkosh Defense. Shares of Workhorse Group, an Ohio-based electric-vehicle company that was competing for the contract, dropped by nearly 50% the next day.	House Democrats called on the Biden administration Tuesday to halt the U.S. Postal Service's $482 million contract with Oshkosh Defense to help modernize the service's aging fleet of delivery trucks until an investigation can prove there was no "inappropriate political influence" in the award. Democratic Reps. Marcy Kaptur and Tim Ryan of Ohio and Jared Huffman of California introduced a resolution that would place a hold on the contract until an investigation is conducted. Kaptur said in a statement that the probe would also determine whether the contract is "consistent with the President's Executive Order to electrify the federal fleet." The USPS announced on Feb. 23 that it awarded the first part of the 10-year, multibillion-dollar contract to update the postal delivery vehicle fleet to Oshkosh Defense. Shares of Workhorse Group , an Ohio-based electric-vehicle company that was competing for the contract, dropped by nearly 50% the next day and have barely recovered since then. The shares jumped by almost 8% on Tuesday, closing at $16.35. A Workhorse Group spokesperson told CNBC that the company applauds "any efforts that support the Biden administration's goal of expanding the government's fleet of clean, non-combustion engine vehicles for the benefit of American tax payors and the environment." An Oshkosh representative didn't respond to CNBC's request for comment. Under the contract, Oshkosh would, over the next decade, manufacture up to 165,000 postal vehicles, roughly a third of the federal government's fleet, according to the announcement. However, USPS chief Louis DeJoy recently told lawmakers that only 10% of the new fleet would be electric, which "would be inconsistent" with President Joe Biden's efforts to electrify the entire federal fleet, the lawmakers said. According to the statement, lawmakers are also concerned about reports of "suspicious" stock trades that were placed just hours before DeJoy announced the deal. "Ten percent makes no sense and flies in the face of President Biden's recent order to electrify the federal fleet," said Kaptur, who chairs the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development and co-chairs the House Auto Caucus. Shares of Oshkosh Corporation, the parent company of Oshkosh Defense, closed down slightly Tuesday. — CNBC's Pippa Stevens contributed to this report.
"What we see today is a small section of the great and expansive missile capability of Revolutionary Guards' naval forces," Guards commander Gen. Hossein Salami said. It is believed to be one of several underground facilities that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard has built along the Gulf coast as tensions with the U.S., Israel and the region rise. The "missile city" also raises questions about how the U.S. and Europeans are going to revive the 2015 nuclear deal.	Iranian state TV has aired footage of what it said was a new Revolutionary Guard base, a "missile city" armed to the teeth with cruise and ballistic weapons. Inside the underground facility, the footage broadcast Monday shows what appear to be advanced munitions including scores of missiles lined up along concrete walls. Outside, the base hosts what the Guard said is electronic warfare equipment, including radar, monitoring devices and simulation and disruption systems. "What we see today is a small section of the great and expansive missile capability of Revolutionary Guards' naval forces," Guards commander Gen. Hossein Salami said on the broadcast. The state TV broadcast did not disclose the exact location of the base, and its authenticity hasn't been independently verified, but it is believed to be one of several underground facilities that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard has built along the Gulf coast as tensions with the U.S., Israel and the region rise. "Iran's parading of its missile capabilities fits in with broader efforts to maintain pressure on Washington in response to extensive U.S. sanctions," Torbjorn Soltvedt, principal MENA analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, told CNBC on Tuesday. "On the nuclear, missile and regional security front, Iranian efforts to place a cost on U.S. sanctions continue apace." Washington and Tehran remain at a standoff as both have indicated a desire to return to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — the Iranian nuclear deal that offered Iran economic relief from sanctions in return for limits to its nuclear program — but each side wants the other to offer concessions first. Iran demands that the U.S. lifts sanctions if it is to engage in talks; the Biden team says it won't lift sanctions unless Tehran reverses its breaches of the nuclear deal. Those breaches include upping its uranium enrichment and stockpiling beyond the parameters of the JCPOA, curtailing U.N. inspector access to its nuclear facilities, and producing uranium metal, which can be used in a nuclear bomb. The U.S. itself initially ditched the nuclear deal under the Trump administration, which then imposed harsh sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy and currency. The "missile city" raises questions about how the U.S. and Europeans are going to revive the nuclear deal. "There's also no doubt that Iran's growing missile capability is a complicating factor for the Biden administration as it explores the possibility of a U.S. return to the JCPOA," Soltvedt said. Iran, lacking the advanced air force of some of its regional neighbors like Israel and the UAE, has instead invested heavily in indigenous missile development and has one of largest missile programs in the region. "The IRGC in general places a lot of emphasis on using missiles to project power," said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia nonproliferation program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. The missile city is "indicative of how much importance the IRGC Navy places on conventional missiles in projecting its power into the Gulf." Critics of the 2015 deal, which include the Gulf Arab states, want to see a more comprehensive approach from President Joe Biden that confronts and curtails Iran's missile activity. This presents the Biden team with a dilemma, Soltvedt says: "Incorporating issues such as Iran's ballistic missile program will make a new nuclear deal much more difficult to achieve. But leaving them out will damage relations with key regional security partners."
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin traveled to Afghanistan on Sunday as Washington considers a potential end to America's longest war. There are about 2,500 U.S. troops currently in the country. The Biden administration has yet to announce its next steps forward in Afghanistan.	WASHINGTON – Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin traveled to Afghanistan on Sunday to meet with the nation's leader, as Washington considers a potential end to America's longest war. The trip, which makes Austin the first Biden Cabinet-level official to visit the war-torn country, comes 40 days ahead of a U.S. troop withdrawal deadline. In February 2020, the United States brokered a deal with the Taliban that would usher in a permanent cease-fire and reduced further the U.S. military's footprint from approximately 13,000 troops to 8,600 by mid-July last year. By May 2021, all foreign forces would leave Afghanistan, according to the deal. There are about 2,500 U.S. troops currently in the country. The Biden administration has yet to announce its next steps forward in Afghanistan. The collective wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria have cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1.57 trillion since Sept. 11, 2001, according to a Defense Department report . The current U.S. military operations, designated Operation Freedom's Sentinel in Afghanistan, Operation Inherent Resolve in Syria and Iraq, and Operation Noble Eagle for homeland security missions in the U.S. and Canada, have accounted for $265.7 billion of that sum. Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, which began in October 2001 and formally ended in December 2014, cost taxpayers $578.7 billion. Of the three current operations, Freedom's Sentinel takes the lion's share of costs at $197.3 billion, followed by Inherent Resolve at $40.5 billion and Noble Eagle at $27.9 billion. According to the report, the money goes toward training, equipment, maintenance as well as food, clothing, medical services and pay for troops. Last month, the world's most powerful military alliance met to discuss an array of challenges facing the 30-member group. High on the agenda was the path forward in Afghanistan. NATO joined the international security effort in Afghanistan in 2003 and currently has more than 7,000 troops in the country. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance will continue to assess the situation on the ground in Afghanistan. "Our aim is to make sure that we have a lasting political agreement that can make it possible for us to leave in a way that doesn't undermine our main goal and that is to prevent Afghanistan from becoming once again a safe haven [for terrorists]," Stoltenberg said. "The majority of the troops are from European allies and partner countries. We will do what is necessary to make sure that our troops are secure," he said when asked if the alliance was prepared for violence if the agreement with the Taliban is broken. Austin told reporters on the heels of the NATO meeting that the U.S. troop drawdown in Afghanistan would be contingent on a reduction of violence in the country. "The violence must decrease, now," Austin said, in his first press briefing with reporters . "I told our allies that no matter what the outcome of our review, the United States will not undertake a hasty or disorderly withdrawal from Afghanistan," he said, referring to the virtual NATO meetings. "There will be no surprises. We will consult each other, consult together and decide together and act together," Austin said of the NATO-led mission.
A top North Korean official said Pyongyang will not respond to numerous invitations to restart nuclear discussions until the United States drops its "hostile policies." The Biden administration initiated contact in February and has since sent multiple e-mails, phone calls and messages through a third country.	WASHINGTON – A top North Korean official said Pyongyang will not respond to numerous invitations to restart nuclear discussions until the United States drops its "hostile policies." "We have already declared our stand that no DPRK-U.S. contact and dialogue of any kind can be possible unless the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy towards the DPRK," said first vice minister of Foreign Affairs, Choe Son Hui, according to a statement released by state-run Korean Central News Agency on Thursday. Choe added that the Biden administration initiated contact in February and has since sent multiple e-mails, phone calls and messages through a third country. She described the attempts at contact as a "cheap trick" for building up public opinion. The statement comes as Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin wrap their first overseas trip under Biden leadership . The pair traveled to Japan and South Korea in an effort to reaffirm U.S. commitments in the region and discuss ongoing security challenges. Coinciding with Blinken's and Austin's arrival in Asia, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued an eerie message to the United States. "We take this opportunity to warn the new U.S. administration trying hard to give off [gun] powder smell in our land," Kim Yo Jong said in a statement referencing joint U.S. and South Korean military exercises in the region. "If it [the U.S.] wants to sleep in peace for the coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step," she added, according to an English translation. When asked about Kim's remarks on Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the Biden administration did not have "a direct comment or response." " Our objective is always going to be focused on diplomacy and denuclearization in North Korea," she said. "Our focus right now is on working with and coordinating with our partners and allies on a range of issues and including security in the region." While in Seoul on Wednesday, Blinken accused Pyongyang of committing "systemic and widespread abuses" against its own people. Under third-generation North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the reclusive state has conducted its most powerful nuclear test, launched its first-ever intercontinental ballistic missile and threatened to send missiles into the waters near the U.S. territory of Guam. Since 2011, Kim has launched more than 100 missiles and conducted four nuclear weapons tests, which is more than what his father, Kim Jong Il, and grandfather, Kim Il Sung, launched over a period of 27 years. The Trump administration made some initial progress with North Korea, but the negotiations broke down more than a year ago after the U.S. refused to grant sanctions relief in exchange for Pyongyang's dismantling of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the alliance had not made a final decision regarding troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, a deadline that is 40 days away. By May 2021, all foreign forces would leave Afghanistan, according to a deal made with the Taliban. The Biden administration has yet to announce its next steps forward in Afghanistan.	WASHINGTON – NATO has not made a final decision regarding troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, a deadline that is 40 days away, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday. "All options are on the table and no final decision has been taken, but I think it is extremely important that allies consult closely," Stoltenberg said ahead of the NATO ministers of foreign affairs meeting, which will include Secretary of State Antony Blinken for the first time. In February 2020, the Trump administration brokered a deal with the Taliban that would usher in a permanent cease-fire and reduce further the U.S. military's footprint from approximately 13,000 troops to 8,600 by mid-July last year. By May 2021, all foreign forces would leave Afghanistan, according to the deal. The majority of troops in the war-weary country are from Europe and partner nations. There are about 2,500 U.S. service members currently in Afghanistan. "The main focus now is to provide support for the renewed efforts to make progress in the peace talks. Peace talks is the only way to find a sustainable political lasting solution to the conflict in Afghanistan and therefore we call on all parties to negotiate in good faith and on the Taliban also to stop providing support to al-Qaeda or international terrorist groups," the NATO chief said adding that the alliance needs "to see a reduction in the level of violence." "We will assess, we will consult and then we will make decisions together as NATO allies," Stoltenberg told reporters Monday. Stoltenberg's comments come one day after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin traveled to Afghanistan to meet with that nation's leader. The trip, which makes Austin the first Biden Cabinet-level official to visit the war-torn country, comes as Washington considers a potential end to America's longest war. The Biden administration has yet to announce its next steps forward in Afghanistan. The wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria have cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1.57 trillion collectively since Sept. 11, 2001, according to a Defense Department report .
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said Monday that the plan would include a nationwide cease-fire, reopening Sanaa airport, and would allow fuel and food imports through Hodeidah port. Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have carried out attacks in Yemen against the Houthis. Last month, President Joe Biden announced the end of U.S. support for offensive operations in Yemen and named a new envoy to oversee the nation's diplomatic mission to end the civil war there.	WASHINGTON – The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia proposed a new peace initiative on Monday that would usher in the end of the war in Yemen. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said Monday that the plan would include a nationwide cease-fire, reopening Sanaa airport and would allow fuel and food imports through Hodeidah port. The Yemen civil war escalated in 2014 when Houthi forces, who are in alliance with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, took over the nation's capital. Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have carried out attacks in Yemen against the Houthis. Former President Donald Trump's administration had backed the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen. Trump vetoed a measure in 2019 aimed at ending U.S. military assistance and involvement in Yemen. At the time Trump said that the congressional resolution was "unnecessary" and that it endangered "the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future." Lawmakers who backed the measure criticized Saudi Arabia for a slew of bombing campaigns that caused thousands of civilian deaths in Yemen. Last month, President Joe Biden announced the halt of U.S. support for offensive operations in Yemen and named a new envoy to oversee the nation's diplomatic mission to end the civil war there. "This war has to end," Biden said during his first address on foreign policy as president. "We are ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen including relevant arms sales." "At the same time, Saudi Arabia faces missile attacks and UAV strikes and other threats from Iranian-supplied forces in multiple countries," Biden said. "We are going to continue to help Saudi Arabia defend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity and its people." The president tapped Tim Lenderking, deputy assistant secretary of State for Iran, Iraq and regional multilateral affairs, to oversee the U.S. diplomatic mission to end the war in Yemen. Biden's policy ending support for offensive operations will not extend to military actions taken by the U.S. against al-Qaeda's affiliate in the region, known as AQAP. Biden also halted sales of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia in order to assess potential human rights abuses. The United Nations has previously said that the ongoing armed conflict in Yemen has produced the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. The U.S. provided more than $630 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen in fiscal 2020, according to figures provided by the State department.
Iran's economy is crumbling after years of U.S. sanctions — and Tehran insists Washington must suspend those restrictions before the two sides can return to nuclear talks. Both sides have indicated interest in returning to the negotiating table, but neither the U.S. nor Iran wants to give in to the other. CNBC takes a look at the state of Iran's economy through six charts.	Iran's economy is crumbling after years of U.S. sanctions — and Tehran insists Washington must suspend those restrictions before the two sides can return to nuclear talks. Both countries have indicated interest in returning to the negotiating table, but neither the U.S. nor Iran wants to give in to the other. Iran signed the nuclear deal — officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — with the U.S., China, France, Russia, the U.K. and Germany in 2015. But former U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement in 2018 and imposed sanctions under a "maximum pressure" policy to force the regime back to negotiations. Here are six charts that show how Iran's economy is struggling. Iran's economy contracted an estimated 4.99% in 2020, steadily shrinking since 2017. In comparison, the Islamic Republic enjoyed a sharp economic growth of 12.5% in 2016 after the nuclear deal was signed. However, that reprieve was short-lived. "It's impossible to know precisely what the numbers would be had there been no sanctions," said Abrams, former U.S. special representative for Iran during the Trump administration who is nowa senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). "But I think it's pretty clear that the sanctions have had an impact on the Iranian economy and on the government budget." The International Monetary Fund sees Iran's gross domestic product growing 3% in 2021. The sanctions lowered Iran's ability to sell oil and prevented them from repatriating money from energy sales, Abrams said. "There are billions of dollars sitting in banks in Iraq and China and South Korea … that Iran cannot get its hands on due to the sanctions," he said. According to IMF estimates, the Islamic Republic's oil exports are expected to continue falling in 2021. Exports and imports both fell sharply after the sanctions were reimposed. Besides oil, Iran's industrial metals, a large source of the country's export revenue, were also sanctioned. IMF estimates suggest Iran fell into a trade deficit of $3.45 billion in 2020. The country had a trade surplus of $6.11 billion in 2019, according to the IMF. The Iranian currency has dropped steadily since early 2018, but Matthew Bey, a senior global analyst at Stratfor, said the rial has "somewhat stabilized." Still, its value on the unofficial market stands at more than 250,000 rials per dollar — that's far from the central bank's official rate of 42,000 rials per dollar that's used for most imported goods. A weaker currency makes imports more expensive for locals, and high inflation means the cost of living is rising at a time when the people are already struggling with a weak economy and job market. High unemployment rates are set to increase even further given Iran's economic struggles. An estimated 12.4% of the population is expected to be out of work in 2021, according to IMF projections. Iran's government is spending beyond its means,  and has seen a widening fiscal deficit. While this is not always a bad thing, it could restrict the country's ability to improve economic activity and recover from the coronavirus pandemic. "I'm sure that the national budget is of some interest (to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) because he would want money for the Revolutionary Guards, for Hezbollah, for the Shia militias in Iraq and for various other expenses that they have," said Abrams from CFR. However, he pointed out that the usual concerns of a civil government — such as national income, average family income, rate of inflation, or jobless rate — may not be important to the religious leaders. An agreement between the U.S. and Iran is not impossible — but only if each side softens its current stance, according to Bey. The United States, Bey said, would have to accept that sanctions relief is a necessary step toward getting Iran to comply with the JCPOA. On the other hand, Iran has to recognize that if it doesn't take "substantial steps," the Biden administration cannot fully suspend sanctions. Abrams, on the other hand, said there's a "very significant problem" in the Biden administration's Iran policy, which is to revive the nuclear deal before negotiating a broader agreement that includes Iran's missile program and its support for militias in the region. "But once you've gone back to the JCPOA, you have lifted most of the significant economic sanctions," he said. "Therefore, you have eliminated most of your leverage to get Iran to agree to these additional things that it does not want … to agree to and I don't see why it would agree at that point," he added. Stratfor's Bey pointed out that Tehran has insisted on sanctions being lifted before talks begin. "Iran appears to have calculated that it can withstand the economic pressure that accumulates as it takes a harder position against the Biden administration," Bey said.
North Korea resumed its missile tests over the weekend, the first to occur under the Biden administration. Pyongyang fired at least one missile. But officials would not elaborate on what type of missile was launched and the location of the test.	WASHINGTON – North Korea last weekend conducted a missile test for the first time during President Joe Biden's administration. Senior administration officials said Tuesday evening that they were monitoring the situation, but stressed that the actions represented a low-level provocation. Pyongyang fired at least one missile, but senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity would not elaborate on what type of weapon was launched, the location of the test, nor its success rate. At a briefing on Tuesday, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby declined to comment on the missile launch. The missile test comes as Pyongyang ignores invitations from Washington to discuss denuclearization and as larger joint U.S. and South Korean military exercises on the peninsula resume. "We are under no illusions about the difficulty this task presents to us. We have a long history of disappointment in diplomacy with North Korea. It's defied expectations of Republican and Democratic administrations alike," a senior administration official said. The official also said that Washington consulted with former Trump administration officials in order to gain additional insight on North Korea. "This type of saber-rattling is not threatening, but rather is intended to get the attention of the Biden administration," wrote retired Lt. Col. Daniel Davis, a senior fellow at Defense Priorities, in a statement reacting to the development. "There's an opening to negotiate for freezes and potentially rollbacks in exchange for limited sanctions relief. But unless Washington is willing to make such trade-offs and normalize relations, expect Kim to continue developing weapons and testing them," Davis added. Harry Kazianis, senior director of Korean studies at the Center for the National Interest, described North Korea's actions as a message to the new administration. "Pyongyang, through these new missile tests, is signaling to team Biden that its military capabilities will continue to get more potent with each passing day," Kazianis said. Last week, a top North Korean official said Pyongyang will not respond to numerous invitations to restart nuke talks until the United States drops its " hostile policies ." "We have already declared our stand that no DPRK-U.S. contact and dialogue of any kind can be possible unless the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy towards the DPRK," said First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Choe Son Hui, according to a statement released by state-run Korean Central News Agency on Thursday. Also last week, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a warning to the United States as Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin embarked on their first overseas trip under Biden leadership. The two visited South Korea and Japan in order to shore up alliances and reiterate U.S. commitments and interests in the region. "We take this opportunity to warn the new U.S. administration trying hard to give off [gun] powder smell in our land," Kim Yo Jong said in a statement referencing joint U.S. and South Korean military exercises in the region. "If it [the U.S.] wants to sleep in peace for the coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step," she added, according to an English translation.

North Korea fired unidentified projectiles into the Sea of Japan, the militaries of South Korea and Japan said Wednesday evening. The string of tests comes as Pyongyang ignores invitations from Washington to discuss denuclearization and as the U.S. and South Korea resume large, joint military exercises.	WASHINGTON – North Korea fired two ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, the militaries of South Korea and Japan said Wednesday evening. "We strictly and strongly protest this launch," Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told reporters in Tokyo, adding that initial assessments tracked the missiles splashing down just outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone. South Korea said its military detected two short-range missiles launched around 7 a.m. local time, the country's Joint Chief of Staff's office told NBC News. It added that South Korean and U.S. intelligence agencies were analyzing the matter and gathering detailed information. A spokesman for U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said, the U.S. is monitoring the situation and consulting its allies and partners. "This activity highlights the threat that North Korea's illicit weapons program poses to its neighbors and the international community. The U.S. commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea and Japan remains ironclad," said the spokesman, Navy Capt. Mike Kafka. The White House and Pentagon did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Over the weekend, North Korea conducted its first missile test since the Biden administration took office . Senior administration officials said Tuesday evening on a call with reporters that Pyongyang fired at least one missile. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, would not elaborate on what type of weapon was launched, the location of the test, nor its success rate.

Sanctions on Myanmar's military need to be tougher as the regime escalates violence on the ground, said Dr. Sasa, a special envoy to the United Nations. The Southeast Asian country has been in turmoil since the military seized power from a democratically elected government on Feb. 1. Sasa called on Russia and China to stop arms sales to the junta.	Sanctions on Myanmar's military need to get tougher as the regime escalates violence on the ground, the country's special envoy to the United Nations told CNBC this week. "We need immediately international targeted, coordinated, tougher sanctions, both economically and diplomatically," said Dr. Sasa. Beyond punishing sanctions, the UN Security Council also needs to send a "unified and strong message" to stop this "crime against humanity" in Myanmar, he said. The Southeast Asian country has been in turmoil since the military seized power from a democratically elected government on Feb. 1. Thousands have taken to the streets to protest against the coup for weeks, and more than 500 have died, according to advocacy group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. Countries around the world have condemned the violence, while the U.S. and Europe have sanctioned individuals or companies related to the military. Sasa also called on Russia and China to halt arms sales to Myanmar's army. "It's very clear they should stop selling the weapons to Burmese military generals," he told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Tuesday. "What they are doing is terrorizing 54 million … people of Myanmar every day, every moment, every second," he said. He said Moscow and Beijing, which have close ties with the junta, have the power to stop the violence. "It's for them to decide right now," Sasa said. Otherwise, it is a "shame" for the two countries, the international community and the UN Security Council, he said. China and Russia, along with India and Vietnam, have helped to soften the UNSC's criticism of the military regime. They requested that a UNSC statement remove references to a coup and the threat of further action. "History will judge us harshly, there's no doubt," he added. "They have to make decisions. They will have to live with the decision that they make." The council is meeting on Wednesday to discuss the situation. Asked why he believes the military would cave to pressure, Sasa said international sanctions would help cut off income. He said the military is taking money from national companies to buy bullets and weapons, and economic restrictions would mean less money, fewer weapons and fewer deaths of civilians. Sasa also said a national unity government will be formed in the coming days and "will not rest" until democracy and freedom is restored in Myanmar. "We will work hard bilaterally. We will be working very closely with our friends and our (allies) around the world," he said, adding that there will be "no future" for the military generals when the country achieves democracy.
Microsoft will deliver to the U.S. Army more than 120,000 devices based on its HoloLens augmented reality headset. The deal, which could be worth as much as $21.88 billion over 10 years, follows a contract Microsoft received to build prototype headsets for the Army. The contract comes a year and a half after Microsoft won a cloud contract from the Pentagon that could be worth up to $10 billion.	The U.S. Army said Wednesday that Microsoft has won a contract to build more than custom HoloLens augmented reality headsets. The contract for over 120,000 headsets could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC. Microsoft shares moved higher after the announcement. The stock was up 1.7% to $235.77 per share at the end of Wednesday's trading session. The deal shows Microsoft can generate meaningful revenue from a futuristic product resulting from years of research, beyond core areas such as operating systems and productivity software. It follows a $480 million contract Microsoft received to give the Army prototypes of the Integrated Visual Augmented System, or IVAS, in 2018. The new deal will involve providing production versions. The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures. An IVAS prototype that a CNBC reporter tried out in 2019 displayed a map and a compass and had thermal imaging to reveal people in the dark. The system could also show the aim for a weapon. "The IVAS headset, based on HoloLens and augmented by Microsoft Azure cloud services, delivers a platform that will keep soldiers safer and make them more effective," Alex Kipman, a technical fellow at Microsoft and the person who introduced the HoloLens in 2015, wrote in a blog post . "The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios." The headset enables soldiers to fight, rehearse and train in one system, the Army said in a statement . The contract, which was awarded on Friday, has a five-year base period, with a five-year option after that, an Army spokesperson told CNBC an email. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The deal makes Microsoft a more prominent technology supplier to the U.S. military. In 2019, Microsoft secured a contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department, beating out Amazon , the leader of the public-cloud market. Amazon has been challenging the contract , which could be worth up to $10 billion, in federal court. Some Microsoft employees asked the company to hold off on submitting for the cloud contract, and similarly, a group of employees called on Microsoft to cancel the HoloLens contract. "We did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is used," the employees wrote in an open letter regarding the HoloLens contract. Days later, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella defended the Army augmented reality project, telling CNN that "we made a principled decision that we're not going to withhold technology from institutions that we have elected in democracies to protect the freedoms we enjoy." The Army, meanwhile, has suggested the augmented reality technology could help soldiers target enemies and prevent the killing of civilians. -- CNBC's Amanda Macias contributed to this report.
The Pentagon will reverse many of the military's Trump-era transgender policies, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby announced Wednesday. The new regulations will allow transgender people to enlist in the military and serve in their preferred gender. In addition, the new rules will expand health-care access as well as assist service members who seek treatment for gender transition.	The Pentagon will reverse many of the military's Trump-era transgender policies, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby announced on Wednesday. The new regulations will allow transgender people to enlist in the military and serve in their preferred gender. In addition, the new rules will expand health-care access, including medical treatment for gender transition. "Secretary of Defense [Lloyd Austin] strongly believes that the all-volunteer force thrives when it is composed of diverse Americans who can meet the high standards for military service, and an inclusive force that strengthens our national security posture," Kirby said. Currently, only transgender troops covered by a 2016 Obama administration policy are allowed to serve openly. The change in policy comes on the heels of a two-month Defense Department review and coincides with International Transgender Day of Visibility. President Joe Biden in January signed an executive order that called on all agencies to conduct a review of existing policies and regulations toward gender discrimination. Shortly before the executive order, Biden nominated transgender doctor Rachel Levine as assistant health secretary. Levine became the first openly transgender federal official to be confirmed by the Senate. Biden's approach to transgender troops diverges from his predecessor's. In 2017, former President Donald Trump tweeted that he would no longer allow "transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military." Trump's first Defense secretary, James Mattis, issued a compromise that grandfathered in some service members but required that new recruits serve in their original birth gender. Advocacy groups spoke out against the policy, the implementation of which was held up by successful legal challenges in federal courts. That changed in 2019 when the Supreme Court permitted the Trump administration to enforce the ban on transgender troops while court battles continued. Trump also reversed Obama-era health-care protections for the transgender community, which gave health-care companies the ability to discriminate based on gender identity. It's unclear if those policies will be addressed in the coming months. — CNBC's Amanda Macias contributed to this report.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani told a cabinet meeting in Tehran on Wednesday that initial talks with the U.S. and world powers in Vienna to rescue the deal were a "success" that opened a "new chapter" to save the agreement. Both countries described the indirect talks on Tuesday as a "useful step" and "constructive" despite neither representative actually meeting face-to-face. President Joe Biden has ruled out any "unilateral gestures" but is still open to exploring how the U.S. might resume its own compliance with the deal.	The United States and Iran will resume talks on Friday aimed at restoring trust and bridging what Washington calls "tremendous and profound differences" over how to salvage their failed nuclear agreement. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told a cabinet meeting in Tehran on Wednesday that initial talks with the U.S. and world powers in Vienna to rescue the deal were a "success" that opened a "new chapter" to save the agreement, according to a statement via his official website. Both countries described the indirect talks on Tuesday as a "useful step" and "constructive" despite neither representative actually meeting face-to-face. Officials chose instead to use European signatories to the deal to act as intermediaries. "We are not optimistic or pessimistic about the outcome of this meeting now, but we are confident that we are on the right track," said Ali Rabiei, an Iranian government spokesperson. "Surely the full implementation of this agreement will be finalized within the coming weeks," he added. Tehran is taking an "all or nothing" approach to the talks. It wants Washington to guarantee the full removal of Trump era sanctions in order to scale back its enrichment activity. The Iranian side is also pressured by time, with Presidential elections set to fall in June this year that will remove President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif from office. Washington, however, is seeking a "compliance for compliance" approach, with President Joe Biden ruling out any "unilateral gestures" but still open to exploring how the U.S. might also resume its own compliance with the deal. An early economic olive branch appears to have already failed, with Iran describing a proposal from the U.S. to release $1 billion of frozen oil money in exchange for Iran capping its uranium enrichment program as "ridiculous." "The first issue that these talks are going to have to resolve is the basic disconnect in approach," Kirsten Fontenrose at the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative told CNBC's Hadley Gamble on Wednesday. "Until you square that circle, you can't get anywhere," she said. With talks in Vienna scheduled to resume on Friday, two working groups were established to set the framework for negotiation. The first group is focused on the issue of American sanctions, which were imposed by the Trump administration after it left the original deal in 2018. The second group is exploring how to bring Iran back into compliance with the limits set by the original JCPOA on enrichment and stockpiles of enriched uranium. Iran has repeatedly violated the terms of the agreement, causing concern among European and world signatories and stoking tensions among its neighbors in the Middle East. Friday's talks could set the stage for more constructive talks, or a full blown showdown. In the past, Iran has used the first week of April to celebrate its "Day of Nuclear Technology", which showcases the country's nuclear achievements. The event was delayed last year due to the coronavirus outbreak. "This day is an opportunity for people to see that in these years, despite the economic pressures, what great advances and achievements have been made in the field of the country's nuclear technologies," President Rouhani said. Oil prices recovered slightly as initial talks concluded. A breakthrough could be bearish for crude oil, analysts say, if it raises the prospect of large quantities of Iran oil exports returning to the market. "If I was sitting at an oil trading desk, I would probably think I'm in a pretty safe space, because it looks like this is going to continue on as it has," Fontenrose said. "We won't have much disruption because we're not coming close to getting Iranian oil back on the market, and we're not seeing any big steps by Iran or the Gulf that would be destabilizing to the energy flow," she added.
The Biden administration said Wednesday it is disturbed by reports that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's health has deteriorated since his imprisonment and reiterated calls for his immediate release. Navalny is on a hunger strike to force his jailers to provide access to outside medical care for pain in his back and legs. The Kremlin has declined to comment on his health.	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration said Wednesday that it is disturbed by reports that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's health has deteriorated since his imprisonment and reiterated calls for his immediate release. Navalny, who was detained in January at an airport in Moscow , is on a hunger strike in order to force his jailers to provide access to outside medical care for pain in his back and legs. A lawyer for Navalny said he is suffering from two spinal hernias, AP reported . The Kremlin has declined to comment on his health. "We urge Russian authorities to take all necessary actions to ensure his safety and health. So long as he is imprisoned, the Russian government is responsible for his health and well-being," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday during a briefing. "We stand with like-minded allies and partners in calling for his immediate release as well as an end to the persecution of his supporters," she said, adding that Navalny's imprisonment was "politically motivated" and a "gross injustice." Human rights group Amnesty International told Reuters on Wednesday that it believed Russian authorities were attempting to slowly kill Navalny during his imprisonment. Navalny, a leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, flew to Russia in January from Berlin , where he spent nearly half a year recovering from a nerve agent poisoning that took place in August. He was arrested at passport control and later sentenced to more than two years in prison . Last summer, Navalny was medically evacuated to Germany from a Russian hospital after he became ill following reports that something was added to his tea. Russian doctors treating Navalny denied that the Kremlin critic had been poisoned and blamed his comatose state on low blood sugar levels. In September, the German government said that the 44-year-old Russian dissident was poisoned by a chemical nerve agent, describing the toxicology report as providing " unequivocal evidence. " The military-grade nerve agent was in the family of Novichok, which was developed by the Soviet Union . Toxicology tests conducted in France and Sweden came to the same conclusion. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied having a role in Navalny's poisoning. Last month, the United States sanctioned seven members of the Russian government for the alleged poisoning and subsequent detention of Navalny. The sanctions are the first to target Moscow under President Joe Biden's leadership. The Trump administration did not take action against Russia over the Navalny situation. Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote in a separate statement that the sanctions would "send a clear signal" to Russia that use of chemical weapons and human rights abuses carry hefty consequences. "Any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable and contravenes international norms," Blinken wrote.
The Biden administration announced it will restore U.S. humanitarian and economic development aid for Palestinians. The aid package includes $75 million in economic and development assistance in the West Bank and Gaza, $10 million for peacebuilding programs through the USAID, and $150 million in humanitarian assistance under the U.N.	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced Wednesday that it will restore U.S. humanitarian assistance and economic development for Palestinians through a series of multimillion-dollar packages. The aid package includes $75 million in economic and development assistance in the West Bank and Gaza, $10 million for peacebuilding programs through the U.S. Agency for International Development and $150 million in humanitarian assistance for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. At a State Department briefing on Wednesday, spokesman Ned Price told reporters that the United States had discussed the relief package with relevant allies and partners in the region. "The United States is committed to advancing prosperity, security, and freedom for both Israelis and Palestinians in tangible ways in the immediate term, which is important in its own right, but also as a means to advance towards a negotiated two-state solution," Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote in a statement. In 2018, then-President Donald Trump cut nearly $300 million in annual funding for the U.N. agency supporting Palestinian refugees.
The White House said it was engaged in discussions with NATO allies about growing tensions in Ukraine amid Russia's military buildup near the border. "Russia now has more troops on the border with Ukraine than at any time since 2014," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a briefing. Russia has increased its military presence along the Ukrainian border, sparking concerns in the West of a military conflict between the two neighboring countries. A Kremlin spokesman said Russia will deploy its forces on its territory where it wants for as long as it wants. Russia is conducting more than 4,000 military drills this month, according to the country's Defense Ministry.	WASHINGTON – The Biden administration said Thursday that it was engaged in discussions with NATO allies about escalating tensions in Ukraine as Russia has increased its military presence near the country's border. "Russia now has more troops on the border with Ukraine than at any time since 2014, five Ukrainian soldiers have been killed this week alone," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a briefing, calling the matter "deeply concerning." "The United States is increasingly concerned by recent escalating Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine, including Russian troop movements on Ukraine's border," she said, adding that the Biden administration was consulting with NATO allies about the uptick in tensions and cease-fire violations. Psaki's comments follow a contentious phone call between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin , in which she demanded that Moscow reduce its force posture in the area near eastern Ukraine. "The Chancellor demanded that this build-up be unwound in order to de-escalate the situation," the German government wrote in a readout of the call between the two leaders. In recent weeks, Russia has increased its military presence along the Ukrainian border, sparking concerns in the West of a budding military conflict between the two neighboring countries. The Russian Defense Ministry has said it is conducting more than 4,000 military drills this month to inspect its forces readiness. "Russia's armed forces are on Russian territory in the places it considers necessary and appropriate, and they will stay there for as long as our military leadership and supreme commander consider it appropriate," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when asked how long Russian forces would remain near Ukraine , according to Reuters.

Moscow has denied it has forces in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv has been battling Russian-backed separatists in a conflict that has left at least 13,000 people dead since 2014, according to U.N. figures. The Kremlin has said that it is concerned about the rising tensions in eastern Ukraine and that it feared Kyiv's forces were attempting to restart a conflict. "It's not completely clear what the Russians are doing there, we'd like to understand that more, and that uncertainty is obviously not contributing to a more stable, more secure situation," Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday. "As I said, the full intentions are not 100% clear and we'd like to understand more about what it is the Russians are doing there and what they intend to do there, but it is not conducive, this buildup and a fairly rapid buildup, it's not conducive to greater stability," Kirby added. The buildup of Russian troops has led to repeated calls from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to accelerate his nation's admittance into the NATO alliance. President Joe Biden spoke with Zelenskiy last week, expressing U.S. support for Ukraine's sovereignty "in the face of Russia's ongoing aggression." When asked about Ukraine's potential entry into the alliance, the Pentagon, State Department and White House have reiterated that all eligible countries should meet NATO's standard for membership. "We are committed to ensuring that aspirant countries wishing to join NATO meet the organization's standard for membership," State Department spokesman Ned Price said when asked about Ukraine's status. "To that end, we continue to urge the government of Ukraine to implement the deep, comprehensive, and timely reforms necessary to build a more stable, democratic, prosperous, and free country," he added.
Secretary of State Blinken said he was concerned about the Russian troop buildup on the Ukrainian border and warned Moscow that "there will be consequences" for aggressive behavior. "President Biden's been very clear about this. If Russia acts recklessly, or aggressively, there will be costs, there will be consequences," Blinken said, adding that the United States was discussing the rising military tensions on the border with allies and partners. In recent weeks, Moscow has increased its military presence along the Ukrainian border, sparking concerns in the West of a budding military conflict between the two neighboring countries.	WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday he was concerned about the number of Russian troops massing on the Ukrainian border and warned Moscow that "there will be consequences" for aggressive behavior. "I have to tell you I have real concerns about Russia's actions on the borders of Ukraine. There are more Russian forces massed on those borders than at any time since 2014 when Russia first invaded," Blinken said during an interview on "Meet the Press" Sunday. "President Biden's been very clear about this. If Russia acts recklessly, or aggressively, there will be costs, there will be consequences," Blinken said, adding that the United States was discussing the unfolding aggression on the border with allies and partners.

And we want to know more about what it is they're doing and what their intentions are because we don't believe it's conducive to security and stability there.," Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters Friday. Later this week, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will meet in person with NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg at the alliance headquarters in Brussels.
President Joe Biden will withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by September, missing a crucial May 1 deadline that was brokered by the Trump administration. Biden's removal of U.S. forces will coincide with the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks that triggered the nation's entry into what would become its longest war.	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by September, missing a crucial May 1 deadline that was brokered by the Trump administration, a senior administration official said on Tuesday. Biden's removal of U.S. forces will coincide with the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks that triggered the nation's entry into what would become its longest war. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the withdrawal of U.S. and foreign troops from the war-torn country could happen well before September. "We will reposition our counterterrorism capabilities retaining significant assets in the region to counter the potential reemergence of a terrorist threat to the homeland from Afghanistan and to hold the Taliban to its commitment to ensure Al Qaeda does not once again threaten the United States or our interests or our allies," the official said. The administration understands that "military force would not solve Afghanistan's internal political challenges," the official said. Biden is slated to announce his plan on Wednesday. In February 2020, the Trump administration brokered a deal with the Taliban that would usher in a permanent cease-fire and reduce further the U.S. military's footprint from approximately 13,000 troops to 8,600 by mid-July last year. By May 2021, all foreign forces would leave Afghanistan, according to the deal. The majority of troops in the country are from Europe and partner nations. About 2,500 U.S. service members are now in Afghanistan. Last month, Biden told reporters during his first press conference that he could not yet commit to the May 1 deadline. "It's going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline," Biden said, adding, "it is not my intention to stay there for a long time." When asked if U.S. service members would remain in Afghanistan another year, Biden said he did not see that being the case. "We are not staying a long time. We will leave, the question is when we leave," the president said, adding that his administration was in consultations with NATO allies and partners in the region. The announcement comes as Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin meet with NATO partners in Brussels. NATO joined the international security effort in Afghanistan in 2003 and currently has more than 7,000 troops in the country. The wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria have cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1.57 trillion collectively since Sept. 11, 2001, according to a Defense Department report .

President Joe Biden proposed a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a phone call Tuesday between the two leaders, the White House said. The call, at least the second between the two men since Biden took office in January, comes as the U.S. and other Western countries grow weary of Moscow's budding troop presence along its border with Ukraine. In its brief summary of the conversation, the White House said the two discussed "a number of regional and global issues."	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden proposed a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a phone call Tuesday between the two leaders, the White House said. Biden proposed holding the summit "in the coming months," said a readout of the call provided Tuesday by the administration. The call, at least the second between the two men since Biden took office in January, comes as the United States and other Western countries grow weary of Russia's budding troop presence along its border with Ukraine. In a brief summary of the conversation, the White House said the two discussed "a number of regional and global issues." Biden proposed holding a summit somewhere outside the U.S. and Russia "to discuss the full range of issues facing" the countries. The Kremlin later on Tuesday said in a statement that Biden had "suggested considering the possibility of holding a personal summit meeting in the foreseeable future." "Both presidents expressed their willingness to continue the dialogue on the critical areas of ensuring global security, which would meet the interests not only of Russia and the United States, but the entire international community," the Russian readout said. "In addition, Joseph Biden expressed interest in normalising the state of affairs on the bilateral track and establishing stable and predictable interaction on pressing matters such as ensuring strategic stability and arms control, Iran's nuclear programme, the situation in Afghanistan, and global climate change," it added. Neither readout indicated whether Putin agreed to the summit or how he received the proposal. Other topics broached during the conversation included Russia's alleged interference in American elections and cyber attacks on U.S. institutions. Biden also raised concerns about the recent Russian military buildup near Ukraine and in Crimea, which Russia claims as its own and the U.S. and Ukraine view as occupied territory. "President Biden emphasized the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity," the White House said. The Kremlin readout said, "When exchanging views on the internal Ukrainian crisis, Vladimir Putin outlined approaches to a political settlement based on the Minsk Package of Measures." There is no mention in the White House or Kremlin readout of any discussion of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. Navalny's representatives have said the Putin foe, who was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok in August, is in failing health. The Biden administration has alleged that the Russian government was behind the poisoning and sanctioned seven Russian officials last month over the attack. Putin has denied playing a role. During the first post-inauguration phone call between Biden and Putin, in January, Biden brought up Navalny and "did not hold back," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at the time.

Iran will begin enriching uranium at 60%, a significant step toward weapons-grade material. Tehran's decision comes two days after the nation's underground Natanz atomic facility experienced a blackout. Iran has formally accused Israel of being behind the attack and vowed revenge.	WASHINGTON – Iran will begin enriching uranium at 60%, a significant step toward weapons-grade material, in response to an attack at a key nuclear site, the country's top nuclear negotiator told state media on Tuesday. Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said he informed the International Atomic Energy Agency, which oversees the monitoring and inspection of nuclear sites, of Tehran's decision. An estimated 90% of enriched uranium is needed to develop a bomb. The move comes two days after Tehran said its underground Natanz atomic facility experienced a blackout. The Natanz facility has been previously targeted by cyberattacks. Iran's Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, described the event on Sunday as an act of "nuclear terrorism ." A day later, Iran formally accused Israel of being behind the attack and vowed revenge. Read more: Iran calls Natanz atomic site blackout ‘nuclear terrorism,’ Israeli media indicate a cyberattack The blackout at Natanz coincided with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's arrival in Israel for meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Benny Gantz. The Israeli government has not publicly commented on the incident. The White House on Monday said the United States was not involved in the attack. Iran's decision to increase its enrichment of uranium comes as the Biden administration works to revive the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, nuclear agreement. The JCPOA, brokered by the Obama administration, lifted sanctions on Iran that had crippled its economy and cut its oil exports roughly in half. In exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief, Iran agreed to dismantle some of its nuclear program and open its facilities to more extensive international inspections. Alongside the United States, France, Germany, the U.K., Russia and China ⁠were also signatories of the agreement. In 2018, then-President Donald Trump kept a campaign promise and unilaterally withdrew the United States from the JCPOA calling it the "worst deal ever." Trump also reintroduced sanctions on Tehran that had been previously lifted. Following Washington's exit from the landmark nuclear deal, other signatories of the pact ⁠have struggled to keep the agreement alive.
"It is time to end America's longest war. It is time for American troops to come home," President Joe Biden said. The U.S. invaded Afghanistan nearly 20 years ago after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria have cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1.57 trillion collectively since Sept. 11, 2001, according to a Defense Department report. More than 2,000 U.S. service members have lost their lives in Afghanistan.	WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden said Wednesday he will withdraw U.S. combat troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, ending America's longest war. The removal of approximately 3,000 American service members coincides with the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks which spurred America's entry into lengthy wars in the Middle East and Central Asia. "It is time to end America's longest war. It is time for American troops to come home," Biden said in his televised address from the White House Treaty Room, where former President George W. Bush announced military action against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in October 2001. "I am now the fourth American president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan. Two Republicans. Two Democrats. I will not pass this responsibility to a fifth," Biden said, adding that the U.S. mission would be solely dedicated to providing assistance to Afghanistan and supporting diplomacy. During his address, Biden invoked the military service of his own son — Beau Biden, who deployed to Iraq for a year and later died of cancer in 2015. He is the first president in 40 years to have a child serve in the U.S. military and serve in a war zone. The president said the U.S. achieved its objectives a decade ago when it killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda — the terrorist group that launched the Sept. 11 attacks. Since then, the U.S. reasons for remaining in Afghanistan have become unclear as the terrorist threat has dispersed across the globe, Biden said. "With the terror threat now in many places, keeping thousands of troops grounded and concentrated in just one country, at a cost of billions each year, makes little sense to me, and to our leaders," Biden said. "We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan, hoping to create ideal conditions for the withdrawal and expecting a different result." Biden said that he coordinated his decision with international partners and allies as well as Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and spoke to former President Bush. The withdrawal of U.S. troops will begin on May 1. Following his remarks, Biden said he would visit Section 60 at Arlington National Cemetery, the final resting place for Americans killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a statement following Biden's speech, former President Barack Obama said the United States had "accomplished all that we can militarily and that it's time to bring our remaining troops home." Ghani said he respects the U.S. decision to withdraw its forces and Afghanistan's military is "fully capable of defending its people and country." Biden warned the Taliban that the U.S. would defend itself and its partners from attack as it draws down its forces over the coming months. The president said the U.S. would reorganize its counterterrorism capabilities and assets in the region to prevent the emergence of another terrorist threat. "My team is refining our national strategy to monitor and disrupt significant terrorist threats, not only in Afghanistan, but anywhere they may arise, and they're in Africa, Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere," Biden said. However, CIA Director William Burns acknowledged in testimony Wednesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee that Washington's ability to act on threats emanating from Afghanistan will be diminished by the U.S. withdrawal. Burns said some U.S. capabilities will remain in place. "When the time comes for the U.S. military to withdraw, the U.S. government's ability to collect and act on threats will diminish. That's simply a fact," Burns said. "It is also a fact, however, that after withdrawal, whenever that time comes, the CIA and all of our partners in the U.S. government will retain a suite of capabilities, some of them remaining in place, some of them that we will generate, that can help us to anticipate and contest any rebuilding effort," Burns said. In February 2020, the Trump administration brokered a deal with the Taliban that would usher in a permanent cease-fire and reduce further the U.S. military's footprint from approximately 13,000 troops to 8,600 by mid-July last year. By May 2021, all foreign forces would leave Afghanistan, according to the deal. The majority of troops in the country are from Europe and partner nations. About 2,500 U.S. service members are now in Afghanistan. Under the agreement, the Taliban promised it would stop terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a base to launch attacks against the U.S. or its allies and agreed to conduct peace talks with the central government in Kabul. Biden said the U.S. would hold the Taliban to its commitments. "We'll hold the Taliban accountable for its commitment not to allow any terrorist to threaten the United States or its allies from Afghan soil. The Afghan government has made that commitment to us as well, and we'll focus our full attention on the threat we face today," Biden said. However, the peace process suffered a setback this week when the Taliban said it will not attend a summit on Afghanistan in Turkey scheduled for later this month and will not attend any conference until foreign forces leave the country. The announcement to leave Afghanistan comes on the heels of a Wednesday meeting between NATO allies and Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. NATO joined the international security effort in Afghanistan in 2003 and currently has more than 7,000 troops in the country. "Our allies and partners have stood beside us shoulder to shoulder in Afghanistan for almost 20 years and we are deeply grateful for the contributions they have made to our shared mission," Biden said. "The plan has long been in together and out together." NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday from the alliance's headquarters in Brussels that the "drawdown will be orderly, coordinated and deliberate." "We went into Afghanistan together, we have adjusted our posture together and we are united in leaving together," Stoltenberg said, adding "any Taliban attacks on our troops during this period will be met with a forceful response." The NATO mission in Afghanistan was launched after the alliance activated its mutual defense clause — known as Article 5 — for the first time in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.

The pre-dawn attacks were on houses in the center of Gaza City, health officials said. A spokesman for the Israeli military said he would look into these reports. The death toll in Gaza jumped to 181, including 52 children, since the fighting erupted last Monday. In Israel, 10 people including two children have been killed in rocket attacks by Hamas and other militant groups.	Israeli air strikes killed 33 Palestinians, including 13 children, in Gaza early on Sunday, Gaza health officials said, and militants fired rockets into Israel as hostilities stretched into a seventh day. The pre-dawn attacks were on houses in the center of Gaza City, health officials said. A spokesman for the Israeli military said he would look into these reports. The death toll in Gaza jumped to 181, including 52 children, since the fighting erupted last Monday. In Israel, 10 people including two children have been killed in rocket attacks by Hamas and other militant groups. With no sign of an end to the worst outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian violence in years, the United Nations Security Council was due to meet later on Sunday to discuss the situation. Both Israel and Hamas, the Islamist group that runs the enclave, said they would continue their cross-border fire after Israel destroyed a 12-storey building in Gaza City on Saturday that housed the U.S. Associated Press and Qatar-based Al Jazeera media operations. The Israel military said the al-Jala building was a legitimate military target, containing Hamas military offices, and that it had given advance warnings to civilians to get out of the building. The AP condemned the attack, and asked Israel to put forward evidence. "We have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building," it said in a statement. In what Hamas called a reprisal for Israel's destruction of the al-Jala building, Hamas fired 120 rockets overnight, the Israeli military said, with many intercepted and around a dozen falling short and landing in Gaza. Israelis dashed for bomb shelters as sirens warning of incoming rocket fire blared in Tel Aviv and the southern city of Beersheba. Around 10 people were injured while running for shelters, medics said. In a burst of air strikes early on Sunday, the Israeli military said it struck the home of Yehya Al-Sinwar in the southern Gaza City of Khan Younis. Sinwar, who was released from an Israeli prison in 2011, heads the political and military wings of Hamas in Gaza. Palestinians working to clear rubble from a building wrecked in Sunday's air strikes recovered the bodies of a woman and man. "These are moments of horror that no one can describe. Like an earthquake hit the area," said Mahmoud Hmaid, a father of seven who was helping with the rescue efforts. Across the border in the Israeli city of Ashkelon, Zvi Daphna, a physician, whose neighborhood has been struck by several rockets, described a feeling of "fear and horror". Israel's security cabinet was due to meet later Sunday to discuss the hostilities. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised address late on Saturday that Israel was "still in the midst of this operation, it is still not over and this operation will continue as long as necessary". Hamas began its rocket assault on Monday after weeks of tensions over a court case to evict several Palestinian families in East Jerusalem, and in retaliation for Israeli police clashes with Palestinians near the city's Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its capital, a status not generally recognized internationally. Palestinians want East Jerusalem - captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war - as the capital of a future state. Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other militant groups have fired more than 2,000 rockets from Gaza since Monday, the Israeli military said on Saturday. Israel has launched more than 1,000 air and artillery strikes into the densely populated coastal strip, saying they were aimed at Hamas and other militant targets. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reminded all sides on Saturday that "that any indiscriminate targeting of civilian and media structures violates international law and must be avoided at all costs," U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. There has been a flurry of U.S. diplomacy in recent days to try to quell the violence. President Joe Biden's envoy, Hady Amr, arrived in Israel on Friday for talks. Biden spoke with both Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas late on Saturday, the White House said. But any mediation is complicated by the fact that the United States and most Western powers do not talk to Hamas, which they regard as a terrorist organization. In Israel, the conflict has been accompanied by violence among the country's mixed communities of Jews and Arabs, with synagogues attacked and Arab-owned shops vandalized. There has also been an upsurge in deadly clashes in the occupied West Bank. At least 15 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops in the West Bank since Friday, most of them during clashes.
When it comes to UFOs, or what the Pentagon refers to as “unidentified aerial phenomena,” the United States has “a massive intelligence failure on its hands,” according to Christopher Mellon. The U.S. Navy formalized a reporting process in 2019 for pilots to report incidents of UFO sightings. Congress is set to be briefed on UFOs in June.	When it comes to UFOs, or what the Pentagon refers to as "unidentified aerial phenomena," the United States has "a massive intelligence failure on its hands," said Christopher Mellon, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence. "It's extremely disturbing to think that, after spending hundreds of billions of dollars for so many years, and believing our airspace to be secure, in fact, we've had vehicles operating restricted military airspace with impunity on a recurring and sustained basis for many years," said Mellon, who served under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The Pentagon declassified three videos taken by U.S. Navy pilots last April which show unidentified objects flying at high speeds in the Earth's atmosphere along with audio of Navy pilots expressing shock and awe. The U.S. Navy formalized a reporting process in 2019 for pilots to report incidents of UFO sightings, saying in a statement that there have been "a number of reports of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled ranges and designated airspace in recent years." Congress is set to be briefed on UFOs in June, but Mellon told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith" that it is unlikely the classified information that will be shared with senators will be shared with the public. That's because details about strategic defense systems, like those used to prevent nuclear warfare, could be disclosed, and that would put U.S. safety at risk. Mellon advised that an important next step for the federal government when it comes to unidentified aerial phenomena would be to "overcome our self-inflicted ignorance, and start collecting data."
Israel's military reported that 62 of its fighter jets dropped 110 guided bombs onto the Gaza Strip overnight and into Tuesday. Mounting international calls for a cease-fire went ignored as shelling and rocket attacks continue from both sides.	The fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants continued into its ninth day Tuesday, with two Thai workers killed at a packaging plant in southern Israel overnight by rockets fired from Gaza, according to Israeli authorities. Health officials in Gaza recorded no overnight deaths in the Palestinian enclave for the first time since the violence began on May 10. Mounting international calls for a cease-fire, including from U.S. President Joe Biden, went ignored as shelling and rocket attacks continue from both sides. Israel's military reported that 62 of its fighter jets dropped 110 guided bombs onto the Gaza Strip overnight and into Tuesday, saying its targets included Hamas leaders, its tunnel network and rocket launchpads. It also said that 90 rockets had been fired from Gaza overnight, making the latest total 3,440 rockets, the majority of which caused no casualties. In Jerusalem, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and elsewhere in Israel, Palestinian protesters held a strike in support of Gaza. Israel has said it would continue its offensive to take out Hamas and Islamic Jihad — U.S.-designated terrorist organizations — the former of which also governs the Gaza Strip, a 140-square mile strip of land housing 2 million people that has been under Israeli blockade since 2007. But Israel's offensive, which it says is targeted at Hamas, has led to 213 Palestinian deaths in Gaza as of Tuesday afternoon, including 61 children and 36 women, according to Gaza authorities. The violence between Israelis and Palestinians is the worst in the region in seven years, and Sunday — which saw Israeli fighter jets level three buildings in Gaza — has been the deadliest day since the latest hostilities began. Rocket attacks from Hamas and Islamic Jihad have also continued. Israeli strikes on what it says are Hamas tunnel networks have collapsed underneath Palestinian homes, leaving families buried in rubble. Ten people have died in Israel, including two children, Israeli authorities said Monday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised address Sunday that Israel "wants to levy a heavy price" from Gaza's Hamas leaders and that its offensive on the blockaded territory would "take time." In a phone call between Biden and Netanyahu on Monday, the U.S. president reportedly called for a cease-fire, but did not demand an immediate stop to the violence from Israel's military. "The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is not talking about a cease-fire. We're focused on the firing," Israeli military's chief spokesman, Brig. Gen. Hidai Zilberman, told the country's Army Radio station on Tuesday. On May 5, before full-scale hostilities erupted but amid growing protests and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces, the Biden administration notified Congress of an intended sale of $735 million in precision-guided weapons to Israel, Reuters reported. Israel is the single largest beneficiary of U.S. military aid, at $3.1 billion annually. The State Department did not immediately reply to a CNBC request for comment.
Hamas says it sees a cease-fire happening in the coming days, but so far Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu says he plans to carry on the military offensive. The violence in the territory — the worst it has seen since 2014 — has left at least 227 Palestinians dead, at least 63 of them children. At least 12 people in Israel have been killed, two of them children as Hamas fired thousands of rockets on Israeli cities and towns.	UPDATE: Israel and Hamas have agreed to a cease-fire.  Israel launched a fresh wave of airstrikes over the Gaza Strip early Thursday in what it said are continued operations to take out Hamas targets. Hamas, meanwhile, has indicated it sees a cease-fire happening within the next few days. So far, however, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he plans to carry on the offensive, telling Israeli media Wednesday night that he is "determined to continue in this operation until its objective is achieved." Top Hamas official Moussa Abu Marzouk told a Lebanese television channel he expected a cease-fire in one to two days, while mediation efforts led by Egypt — the only country with open lines of communication to Hamas and Israeli leaders — are reportedly ongoing. U.S. President Joe Biden discussed efforts to achieve a cease-fire with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on Thursday, according to a White House readout of the call. White House press secretary Jen Psaki called the reports of a potential cease-fire "encouraging," but she did not confirm an agreement had been reached when pressed by journalists at a Thursday briefing. Psaki said the administration expects Israel to wind down its military operations "in short order." Biden had told Netanyahu on Wednesday he "expects a significant de-escalation in Gaza," but so far those words have not been heeded, and the exchange of fire from both sides continues. The bombings early Thursday from Israeli fighter jets killed at least one Palestinian, wounded several others and destroyed at least five homes, according to health officials in Gaza. Hamas, the U.S.-designated terrorist organization and political party that has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, has fired more than 4,000 rockets at Israel. The recent violence in the territory — which began May 10 and is the worst it has seen since 2014 — has left at least 227 Palestinians dead, at least 63 of them children. At least 12 people in Israel have been killed, two of them children. Some Hamas rockets have also reportedly landed in Gaza, killing Palestinians as well. Israel's military said it hit at least four homes belonging to Hamas commanders, targeting "military infrastructure" and weapons storage, particularly Hamas' network of underground tunnels. But those tunnels run under civilian neighborhoods, meaning several Palestinian families have lost their homes, with many civilians buried in the rubble. -- CNBC's Spencer Kimball contributed to this report.
National Guard troops began Monday to depart the U.S. Capitol grounds following a five-month deployment after the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection. The number of troops deployed to the Capitol swelled to 25,000 ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.	WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin thanked National Guard troops Monday as they began departing the U.S. Capitol at the end of their deployment following the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection. "These airmen and soldiers protected not only the grounds, but the lawmakers working on those grounds, ensuring the people's business could continue unabated. They lived out in very tangible ways the oath they took to support and defend the Constitution," Austin wrote in a statement, recounting their five-month deployment. "They came here from all 54 states and territories, leaving behind jobs, homes and families, to bolster security at the Capitol in the wake of the dramatic events on January 6th. Many of them volunteered for this duty, and most of them did so on little notice," he added. About 1,000 troops will depart the Capitol in the next few days, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said during a press briefing Monday. The breach of the Capitol on Jan. 6 delayed the formal congressional count of Biden's 2020 election victory over then-President Donald Trump. Dozens of Republicans in Congress, backed by the president, challenged state results based on unfounded accusations of widespread fraud. Earlier that day, Trump told thousands of supporters at a rally outside the White House to march to the Capitol to protest what historically have been ceremonial proceedings. Hours after rioters swarmed the building, Trump told his supporters to "go home" — even as he reiterated the election lies that prompted them to attack the Capitol in the first place. The number of troops deployed to the Capitol swelled to 25,000 ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. It is typical for the National Guard to be present for inaugurations, and more than 7,000 troops were mobilized for Trump's inauguration in 2017. "It's been a trying but telling year for the National Guard," Austin wrote. "Between natural disasters, civil unrest and an ongoing pandemic, our Guardsmen and women have been tested time and time again."
"Emancipation," a slave drama directed by Antoine Fuqua and starring Will Smith, will no longer be filmed in the state of Georgia due to the passage of a restrictive voting law there. This is the first film to pull its production out of the state because of the legislation. "Emancipation" centers around Whipped Peter, an enslaved person who emancipated himself during the Civil War from a Southern plantation and joined the Union Army.	"Emancipation," a slave drama directed by Antoine Fuqua and starring Will Smith, will no longer be filmed in the state of Georgia due to a new voting law that was signed there by Gov. Brian Kemp in late March. "At this moment in time, the Nation is coming to terms with its history and is attempting to eliminate vestiges of institutional racism to achieve true racial justice," said Smith and Fuqua in a joint statement Monday. "We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access," they said. "The new Georgia voting laws are reminiscent of voting impediments that were passed at the end of Reconstruction to prevent many Americans from voting. Regrettably, we feel compelled to move our film production work from Georgia to another state." This is the first film to pull its production out of the state because of the legislation. The new law, which includes a restriction on drop boxes, makes it a crime to provide food or water to voters lined up outside polling stations, requires mandatory proof of identity for absentee voting and creates greater legislative control over how elections are run. Opponents say these provisions will disproportionately disenfranchise people of color. Since 2008, enticing tax incentives have turned the state a production hub for film and television, particularly for Netflix , HBO Max , Disney's slate of Marvel movies and TV shows, and The CW. Georgia has also developed infrastructure for big-budget productions and is home to a tremendously skilled workforce of crew members, craftsmen and technicians. Hollywood has been debating how to handle this most recent Georgia situation. Some have called for a production boycott, while others have worried that pulling out of the state would do more harm than good. For the most part, studios who have commented on the new law have condemned it , but not committed to halting production. "Emancipation," which Fuqua and Smith are producing for Apple Studios , centers around Whipped Peter, an enslaved person who emancipated himself durng the Civil War from a Southern plantation and joined the Union Army. He is most famous for being the subject of a series of photographs, which show the shockingly brutal scars on his back from being whipped as a slave. It is unclear what the financial toll will be for moving the project's production out of Georgia, but having Fuqua and Smith, who are both Black and major players in Hollywood and internationally, support the decision could put more pressure on other productions to leave the state.
TIAA CEO Roger Ferguson emphasized the benefits of a diverse and inclusive workplace. The firm’s practices have enabled it to put together a highly rated fund family. The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated wealth disparities in the U.S.	Diversity in the workplace isn't just the right thing to do, it's also the most profitable thing to do, outgoing TIAA CEO Roger W. Ferguson Jr. told CNBC. "It actually is economically a smart thing to do from a standpoint of business," Ferguson told CNBC's Sharon Epperson as part of the network's Inclusion in Action forum. "There are more and more studies that show diversity in the boardroom, diversity in C-suites, leads to better performance both in terms profitability, stock market performance … there are many ways in which diversity is the right thing to do and the smart thing to do." Getting a better mix of both workers and executives has taken corporate focus in light of last year's protests against racial injustice, as well as growing wealth and income disparities in the U.S. The Covid-19 pandemic has turned a spotlight on the issue as well, with women and those at the bottom of the income ladder – often people of color – taking a far greater economic hit from the business lockdowns put into effect. Ferguson noted the shrinking middle class and its declining share of the income base as evidence that "the benefits are not spread evenly or equitably across society." "When I think of inclusive capitalism, I think of a society that is not only benefiting but also a more equitable distribution of the benefits," he said. Federal Reserve economists have estimated that the unemployment rate for the bottom fifth of earners is in excess of 20% while the overall jobless level is 6.2% . While falling sharply from the early stages of the pandemic, the unemployment rate is 9.9% for Black people and 8.5% for Hispanics. The unemployment rate for women is 6%, but that has come amid a slide in the labor force participation rate from 58.4% prior to the pandemic to 56.3% in February. Ferguson, who is leaving his TIAA post at the end of March, said trying to avoid those kinds of disparities has made the financial services firm stronger. "Running a diverse and inclusive organization as best we can we think has been beneficial for everybody," he said. He noted that TIAA's hiring process pays close attention to diversity, doing so by making sure it has an inclusive panel used to screen potential candidates. That approach has brought rewards to the company as it has managed $1.3 trillion in funds. The firm's funds ranked in the top 12 for five-year performance in a recent Barron/Lipper fund survey. "We have an aspiration for our company to look as much like America as much as it possibly can," Ferguson said. Ferguson's successor will be Thasunda Brown Duckett, a J.P. Morgan veteran and one of the top Black executives on Wall Street. That she also contributes to the company's diversity profile is just a benefit of getting someone so qualified, Ferguson said. "What's very, very important is she actually is a superb business leader. When you add that to the other components … in terms of gender and race, indeed we have made history here, one Black CEO succeeded by another," he said. Duckett will be the third African-American to lead the firm, with the first being Clifton R. Wharton Jr., from 1987 to 1992. While he is stepping away from the company, Ferguson said he will not be idle. He's been mentioned as a possible appointee in the Biden administration, though he said whatever work he takes on will have the same theme of promoting the virtues of diversity. "There's opportunity basically in analyzing the facts, making policy changes in the public sector, and then having the business sector also play its role as a producer of jobs and a producer of wealth," he said. "I intend to be very active."
A person who gained access to Salesforce's LinkedIn account published a post saying that "BLACK LIVES STILL F----G MATTER." The incident comes after two Black Salesforce employees pointed to workplace issues in resignation letters they published on LinkedIn. The post highlights the challenges that minorities have faced inside Salesforce and other technology companies that have sought to boost diversity.	Salesforce has said before that Black lives matter , but a message posted to the software company's LinkedIn account last Friday expressed the sentiment about racial equality more vigorously than usual. "Hey everybody, we just want you to know what while CPAC is going on, BLACK LIVES STILL F-----G MATTER. PEACE," read a post on Salesforce's account, which has more than 2 million followers. (Last week, conservatives gathered in Florida to attend the annual Conservative Political Action Conference.) The post has since been deleted. The incident highlights the challenges that minorities have faced inside Salesforce and other technology companies that have sought to boost diversity. "Last Friday, we became aware of unauthorized access to one of our social media accounts. We took quick action and secured it," a Salesforce spokesperson told CNBC in an email on Wednesday. The spokesperson didn't comment on the content of the LinkedIn post but did point to a February blog post showing the status of diversity efforts. As of November, 3.4% of Salesforce employees in the U.S. were Black, up from 2.8% in November 2018, according to the company's diversity reports . Black people represented 12.8% of the U.S. population in 2019, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate based on the American Community Survey. In recent weeks, two Black people have come forward to talk about their struggles working at Salesforce. Cynthia Perry, a senior manager who worked on design research, said in the resignation letter she posted on LinkedIn that she had "been gaslit, manipulated, bullied, neglected and mostly unsupported" as a Salesforce employee. Vivianne Castillo, who had been a manager for design research and innovation, posted her resignation letter on LinkedIn as well, saying she was regularly asked to help with internal diversity, equity and inclusion efforts for free on top of her work. Castillo alluded to miners sending canaries into coal mines to check for safety risks before going in. "I've grown tired of watching the canaries of underrepresented minorities leave Salesforce, only to watch Salesforce ramp up their efforts to throw more canaries into the culture that caused the previous ones to leave or worse -- suffer in silence." In July, following protests of the killing of George Floyd while in police custody, Salesforce said it hoped to increase the number of Black employees in the U.S. by 50% by the end of 2023. Other companies also want to hire more Black workers, although not every effort is a smash hit. CNBC reported last month on issues that Black college students encountered while going through Google's Howard West program, including discriminatory treatment from Google employees, with fewer participants than planned. After Salesforce's LinkedIn account published the message on Friday, hundreds reacted with emojis such as the thumbs up and heart, and some users left comments. "Ohanaaaaa," one Salesforce employee wrote, using the Hawaiian word for family, which Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff regularly uses. "Yessss! You're part of ours," the Salesforce account wrote in reply. (In 2018, Bloomberg reported that some Salesforce employees had expressed that the company had misappropriated Hawaiian words and culture.) "Language," another Salesforce employee wrote in response to the original post. "I'm Salesforce, b----," the company account replied. "You are not," the employee wrote back. "Your language demonstrates this." The Salesforce account on Friday also posted a separate post showing support for transgender people. "SALESFORCE wants you to know that TRANS lives matter!" said the message, which was also deleted shortly after it had appeared online. -- Salvador Rodriguez contributed to this report.

It took decades for Black directors to break into the entertainment industry and alter how Hollywood operated behind and in front of the camera. Oscar Micheaux led the charge, launching his own studio in 1919. Directors such as Spike Lee, Ava DuVernay, Jordan Peele and Ryan Coogler are household names, creating works of art and commercially successful projects.	The films that launched the entertainment industry around the turn of the 20th century were created for white audiences by white filmmakers. It took decades for Black directors to break into the industry and alter how Hollywood operated behind and in front of the camera and how it viewed Black content. Oscar Micheaux led the charge, launching his own studio in 1919. Directors such as Melvin van Peebles and Gordon Parks put Black narratives at the forefront of their storytelling in the 1970s, creating a subgenre known as "blaxploitation." These films used Black stereotypes about poverty and drug abuse to put Black actors at the center of the action. Then in the '80s and '90s, Spike Lee and John Singleton used their films to examine urban and racial tensions, providing a mainstream audience with more nuanced Black characters. "I've been blessed with the opportunity to express the views of black people who otherwise don't have access to power and the media," Lee wrote in a companion novel to "Do the Right Thing" published in 1989. "I have to take advantage of that while I'm still bankable." During that time, Black female filmmakers were making strides. Kathleen Collins' work in the '80s paved the way for Julie Dash to become the first Black woman to have a film get a wide release in 1991. Each of these directors helped push back barriers and inspire a new generation of Black filmmakers such as Ava DuVernay, Tyler Perry and Barry Jenkins, who have been recognized not only critically for their work but commercially at the global box office. While Black filmmakers are more prevalent and celebrated in Hollywood in the 21st century, there's still a lot of work to be done. 2020 was a banner year for Black ensemble films. "One Night in Miami," "Da 5 Bloods," "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'' and "Judas and the Black Messiah" stunned critics. However, none of these films was nominated for best picture or best screenplay at the Golden Globes. The Academy Awards will make its nominations in March. Here's a look at 20 Black directors who have changed Hollywood: Hailed as the first major Black filmmaker, Oscar Micheaux directed and produced 42 feature films between 1919 and 1948. He was a writer-turned-filmmaker, using his first novel "The Homesteader" to launch his career in the film industry. During that time, Micheaux's content was classified as "race film," a genre of movies made during the Jim Crow era that were created for and by Black people. Many of his films featured all-Black casts and his characters were not stereotypical, unlike the blackface caricatures seen in more mainstream white films. He tackled subjects such as racial violence, rape, economic oppression and discrimination within his work. He died in 1951 but has posthumously been inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame and awarded the Golden Jubilee Special Directorial Award from the Directors Guild of America. An influential independent documentary filmmaker, William Greaves produced and directed more than 100 films. His films captured social issues as well as key African American figures such as Muhammad Ali and Ida B. Wells. In the late 1960's Greaves garnered attention for his experimental film "Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One." The avant-garde film chronicles a fictional documentary titled "Over the Cliff," which is directed by Greaves, who acts in it. The documentary focuses on actors as they prepare to audition for a dramatic piece. Greaves used three sets of camera crews: One documented the audition process and the actors, the second documented the first film crew and the third documented the actors and the two other film crews. The meta-documentary, as it has come to be called, featured a documentary, a documentary about a documentary and a documentary that documented a documentary about a documentary. Greaves, who passed away in 2014, is a member of the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame and the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Documentary Association. Gordon Parks started his career as a prolific and famed photographer before branching out into filmmaking. He started as a consultant on various Hollywood productions in the '50s before directing a series of documentaries about Black urban life for National Educational Television. Parks became Hollywood's first major Black director, bringing the iconic "Shaft" to theaters in 1971. The film spawned a number of follow-ups and helped spark a subgenre known as blaxploitation. The genre was one in which images of lower-class Blacks being involved with drugs and violence were exploited to make commercially successful films. While this genre played on Black stereotypes, it also cast Black actors in lead roles, instead of as minor characters or sidekicks. Melvin van Peebles directed more than a dozen films during his career in Hollywood, but he is most well known for the 1971 movie  "Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song," which he wrote, directed and acted in. "Sweetback" tells the story of a Black man who is selected as a patsy for a murder by white police officers. The man ends up killing the cops, becomes the target of a massive manhunt and flees to Mexico. It became one of the most successful films of 1971, tallying more than $15 million in box-office sales. The film proved that a story with a strong African-American lead character could be successful at the box office and helped usher in a new wave of Black cinema. A poet, playwright and filmmaker, Kathleen Collins helped break barriers for female directors in Hollywood. She had two major films: "The Cruz Brothers and Miss Malloy" and "Losing Ground," which were released in the early '80s. Although "Losing Ground" was denied a large-scale exhibition, it was among the first films created by a Black woman that was feature-length and created for popular consumption. Collins helped pave the way for future Black women filmmakers to have their films get national commercial distribution. Collins passed away in 1988 from breast cancer. At that time, the bulk of her work was unpublished and left to her daughter. In 2006, Nina Collins began to go through her mother's archive and have it published, restored and reissued. In the mid-'80s Spike Lee emerged in the film industry with "She's Gotta Have It," a film about the love life of a contemporary Black woman. Over the next 40 years, Lee would become known for his exploration of race relations, colorism in the Black community and urban crime and poverty. He has released a movie almost every year since 1986. He was one of the few Black filmmakers making movies for a wide audience during that time and, while his films were not breaking box-office records, they were gaining critical attention. Lee was nominated for best documentary feature in 1998 for "4 Little Girls" and best original screenplay in 1990 for "Do the Right Thing." He received an honorary Oscar in 2016 for his directorial accomplishments. In 2019, Lee finally claimed his first Oscar for best adapted screenplay for his work on "BlacKkKlansman." His most recent feature was "Da 5 Bloods," which was released on Netflix last year. The film received a number of key critics' prizes, including best film from the National Board of Review and one of the top 10 films of the year by the American Film Institute. Marlon Riggs was an American filmmaker, poet and gay rights activist during the '80s and '90s. He produced and directed a number of documentary films including "Tongues Untied," "Ethnic Notions" and "Color Adjustment" prior to his untimely death in 1994 due to complications from AIDS. Riggs used film to examine past and present representations of race and sexuality in the U.S. One of his most controversial documentaries was "Tongues Untied." It looked at gay Black male culture during the AIDS crisis and featured a kiss between two Black men, something that hadn't been portrayed in mainstream media. It was selected by PBS for its "POV" series. The documentary was partially funded by taxpayer money though the National Endowment for the Arts, leading some conservatives to use it in long-running attempts to defund PBS and the NEA. Riggs' work, although controversial, became a lightning rod for the culture war between conservatives and liberals that raged during that time. Just three years after the passing of Collins, Julie Dash released "Daughters of the Dust." It was the first full-length film directed by an African American woman to get a wide theatrical release in the U.S. Dash's 1991 film was named to the National Film Registry in 2004. Dash has directed music videos, commercial spots, shorts and episodic television during her career. She was nominated for a Directors Guild Award for "The Rosa Parks Story," which was released in 2002. At the age of 24, John Singleton became the youngest person ever to be nominated for best director at the Academy Awards and the first African-American. He was nominated for his film "Boyz n the Hood," a 1991 coming-of-age drama that also earned Singleton a best original screenplay nod at the Oscars. Many of Singleton's films examined urban and racial tensions including "Poetic Justice" and "Higher Learning," which were released in the '90s. He also directed the film "2 Fast 2 Furious." Prior to his death in 2019, Singleton wrote, directed or executive produced a number of television shows including "Snowfall," "Rebel," "Empire" and "Billions." F. Gary Gray began his career directing critically acclaimed and award-winning music videos for artists such as Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Outkast. It wasn't until the mid-90s that he made his feature film debut. In the years that followed, Gray released blockbuster hits and award-nominated films including "The Italian Job," "Law Abiding Citizen," "Straight Outta Compton" and "The Fate of the Furious." Gray has directed 10 films in the last three decades, tallying more than $2.2 billion in ticket sales. He is the first Black director to have a film gross more than $1 billion at the global box office. "The Fate of the Furious" tallied $1.2 billion in 2017. Like Gray, Antoine Fuqua got his start in the industry directing music videos. He worked with artists such as Toni Braxton, Coolio, Prince and Stevie Wonder before launching into feature films in 1998. Fuqua is known for directing action and thriller films and has a consistent track record at the box office. His 2001 film "Training Day" earned actor Denzel Washington an Academy Award. His films "King Arthur," "Shooter," "Olympus Has Fallen," "The Equalizer" and "Southpaw" have garnered more than $1.3 billion at the global box office. His most recent work was a 2019 documentary called "What's My Name: Muhammad Ali." Tyler Perry built a multimillion-dollar brand by creating content for an audience that was often ignored by Hollywood. While some have derided the filmmaker for amplifying negative or stereotypical images of Black identity, particularly with his Madea films, he continues to showcase A-list and up-and-coming Black talent in his work. Following the box-office success of his 2005 debut "Diary of a Mad Black Woman," Perry secured a lucrative first-look deal with Lionsgate until 2014. Perry's two dozen theatrical releases have garnered more than $1.1 billion globally. Perry operates one of three major studios in Georgia, where he films his movie and television projects and rents out space to other filmmakers. With his studio, Perry has helped nurture the state's film industry. He has even partnered with the Georgia Film Academy to place interns from the school on productions. Tim Story is one of the most commercially successful Black filmmakers. His directorial debut came in 2002 with "Barbershop," a comedy film that spawned two other films in the franchise. He also directed 2005's "Fantastic Four" and its sequel "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer," which together amassed more than $600 million at the global box office. In total, Story's films, which also include "Think Like a Man," "Ride Along" and 2019's "Shaft," have hauled in more than $1.2 billion worldwide. No, not the American actor. This Steve McQueen is a British filmmaker known for his Academy Award-winning film "12 Years a Slave." Born in London, McQueen spent the '90s making short films before debuting his first feature-length film "Hunger," about the 1981 Irish hunger strike, at the Cannes Film Festival in 2008. In 2011, he released "Shame," a drama about an executive struggling with sex addiction. Two years later, "12 Years a Slave" garnered him the Oscar for best picture, making him the first Black filmmaker to ever win the award. He later adapted a British television series called "Widows" into an American-based film and released "Small Axe," a collection of five films set within London's West Indian community between the 1960s and 1980s. For his work, McQueen has received the Turner Prize, the highest award given to a British visual artist. He has also been appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Barry Jenkins directed two short films before debuting "Medicine for Melancholy" in 2008. The film received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best First Feature. Following an eight-year hiatus from feature filmmaking, Jenkins returned to Hollywood with "Moonlight," an LGBT-themed independent drama, that went on to win numerous accolades including the Academy Award for best picture. Jenkins became the fourth Black person nominated for best director and the second to win a best picture Oscar. His third directorial feature "If Beale Street Could Talk" arrived in 2018 and earned him nominations for best screenplay at the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. Jenkins was most recently tapped by Disney to direct a second live-action "Lion King" film. A student and mentee of director Spike Lee, Dee Rees graduated from New York University and immediately went to work. She interned on Lee's "Inside Man" and "When the Levees Broke" in the mid-'00s, using that time to pen a script that would later be developed into her first feature film, 2011's "Pariah." Her third directorial film, "Mudbound," was nominated for three Academy Awards, including a best screenplay nod for Rees. Rees was the first Black woman nominated for a writing award at the Oscars since Suzanne de Passe in 1973. "Mudbound" also led Rachel Morrison to be the first woman ever nominated for the best cinematography award. Rees has also written and directed television episodes for series such as "Empire," "When We Rise" and "Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams." Ava DuVernay first made a name for herself in Hollywood with her 2012 film "Middle of Nowhere." The film earned her the directing award in the U.S. dramatic competition at Sundance. She was the first Black woman to win this award. Two years later, "Selma" helped DuVernay become the first Black woman to be nominated for a Golden Globe for best director and the first Black female director to be nominated for best picture. In 2017, she was nominated for the Oscar for best documentary feature for her film "13th." While her 2018 Disney fantasy film "A Wrinkle in Time" ultimately lost money at the box office and was a flop with critics, it still garnered more than $100 million domestically. DuVernay was the first Black woman to hit that benchmark. More recently, DuVernay has had a successful run in television. Her Netflix limited series "When They See Us" told the story of the five Harlem teens who were falsely accused of a brutal attack in Central Park. It earned critical acclaim and 16 Emmy nominations. It won the Emmy for outstanding limited series. Last year, DuVernay was elected to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences board of governors as part of the directors branch. DuVernay also founded a film collective called Array in 2010. The company is dedicated to amplifying people of color and female directors in the film industry. "Black Panther" director Ryan Coogler has become a household name in less than a decade. In 2013, he gained critical acclaim and attention for his debut film "Fruitvale Station," which led him to direct "Creed," a spin-off sequel to the Rocky films. For his third film, Disney gave him a budget of $200 million to bring the Black superhero Black Panther to the big screen. The film brought in a record-breaking $235 million during its opening weekend and went on to ring up more than $1.3 billion in ticket sales globally. He is the second Black director to have a film top $1 billion worldwide. In early February, Disney announced that it had struck a five-year deal with Coogler and his company Proximity Media to create television programming exclusively for Disney. He is already contracted to write and direct a second Black Panther film and will now create a TV series for Disney+ based in the fictional world of Wakanda. For many years, Jordan Peele was identified with the comedy show "Key & Peele," in which the filmmaker starred alongside fellow comedian Keegan-Michael Key. However, in 2017, Peele delivered an Oscar-winning feature film called "Get Out." The film was a horror movie about racism that became a breakout hit and critically acclaimed. It exceeded $100 million in sales domestically within its first three weeks in theaters, making Peele the first Black writer-director to hit that mark with his debut movie. "Get Out" was nominated for four Oscars, including best picture, best director, best actor and best screenplay. Peele won the award for best screenplay. Peele's second film "Us" also received critical and commercial success. He is currently working on his third feature. In the meantime, he has been an active producer of television shows including "Hunters," "Lovecraft Country" and "The Twilight Zone" as well as films such as "Candyman" and "BlacKkKlansman." In the last decade, Victoria Mahoney has predominantly worked in television. She has directed episodes of "Queen Sugar," "Grey's Anatomy," "American Crime," "Lovecraft Country," "Power" and "You." She was also handpicked by J.J. Abrams to direct the second unit of "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker," which makes her the first woman to direct a Star Wars film in the franchise's more than 40-year history.
Grocery story chain Publix is a key part of Florida's Covid-19 vaccine strategy. It has unique advantages, such as its pharmacy staff's experience giving vaccinations, convenient locations and a business that's designed for efficiency and profitability. As retailers become a bigger part of the vaccine's rollout, however, states could reinforce inequities by expanding access for people who live near the stores and make it harder for lower-income, minority and rural residents who live in pharmacy or food deserts.	In Florida, hundreds of neighborhood grocery stores have become cornerstones of the state's Covid-19 vaccination program. Publix was tapped by the governor's office in early January to administer shots to senior citizens and other priority groups as part of a pilot program. In about a month, hundreds of thousands of people have flocked to the Florida-based grocer's website, hoping to snag an appointment. Starting next week, Walmart and Winn-Dixie stores in Florida are poised to receive vaccine shipments as part of the federal expansion. By teaming with Publix, the state sought to capitalize on the natural advantages of the private sector: The grocery chain already has pharmacists trained and ready to give the shots. It's designed for efficiency as a company that relies on large shipments of groceries and medications. It administers other vaccines, such as for the seasonal flu and shingles. Its locations are familiar to many Floridians who live near a store or already fill prescriptions or pick up milk there. Yet, the partnership has become a lightning rod for the many criticisms about the broader vaccine rollout. It has sparked a debate about how to fairly and efficiently administer a vaccine that's in short supply, and it illustrates a challenge that could play out across the country. As retailers play a larger roll in the vaccine's rollout, they could  exacerbate the divide between wealthier, White communities that have stores nearby and lower-income, minority and rural residents who do not. The technology used for signups also has created a hurdle for some groups. All the while, the emotionally charged messages on social media, where families searching for appointments share feelings of deep relief and disappointment, will continue to stoke the conversation. "One of the positives of using private companies is more locations, but one of the disadvantages is they're profit maximizing," said Emma Boswell Dean, an assistant professor of health management and policy at University of Miami's Herbert Business School. "They're going to be in the neighborhoods where they can make money. So you have communities hit twice. You're a food desert. Now you're a vaccine desert." The supermarket chain's locations are a long drive from many low-income and Black neighborhoods across the state , according to an analysis by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel . That creates another barrier for those who don't have a car or time off from work. "It's almost like we're missing the populations who are also most affected by Covid throughout the crisis, and that's something that is a lightning rod to a lot of people," Dean said. The vaccine rollout has already been uneven. Most of the nearly 13 million people given at least one shot of a Covid vaccine within the first month of distribution were older, White and female, according to a study by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Yet Covid has had a disproportionate toll on Black Americans. Black Americans have died from Covid at 1.5 times the rate of White people, according to data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project , which is run by journalists at The Atlantic. Other retailers, including Kroger and Texas grocer H-E-B, have started to administer the vaccines at some of their locations as they get doses. This week, the Biden administration said it will increase shipments to states and start sending some doses directly to retail pharmacies , including the country's largest drugstores CVS and Walgreens , which will give shots at some of their stores. For the retailers, the vaccines are a money-making opportunity as well as a way to be good corporate citizens. They get reimbursed for each dose by the government or health insurers and can drive sales by drawing more foot traffic. Meredith Beatrice, a spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, told CNBC the governor's office was in touch with several retailers but Publix was first to answer the call and could quickly mobilize vaccination sites. She said Florida's ability to launch new partnerships depends on its vaccine supply from the federal government. Along with working with Publix, Beatrice said Florida has helped county health departments open nearly 80 vaccination sites, turned Miami's Hard Rock Stadium into a vaccination site, and launched new partnerships to offer the shots at places of worship in underserved areas. Publix spokeswoman Maria Brous said in a statement that its stores are just "one facet to the Governor's overall strategy." Florida has administered the vaccine more rapidly than most other populous states. It also has been quicker to add its many seniors to the priority list, even if they have to wait for an appointment. Nearly 3.7 million vaccines were shipped to Florida as of early Thursday. Only California and Texas have received more, according to the CDC. Florida has distributed 10,354 doses per 100,000 people as of Thursday. That puts it behind more than a dozen smaller states and territories like Connecticut and West Virginia, as well as New York, but ahead of California and Texas. Dean, the University of Miami health management professor, said the Publix partnership is a part of the reason for Florida's success. She said Florida's decision to expand eligibility increased demand and wait times but made it easier for vaccine administrators to find arms to jab. Since Publix administered its first vaccines in Florida on Jan. 7, it has given more than 100,000 doses. The demand is overwhelming. Each store averages about 120 doses per day of the Moderna shot. It's now offering the shots at 325 stores across 23 counties — more than 40% of its nearly 750 stores in the state with pharmacies. And it also provides vaccinations in Georgia and South Carolina. The government, not Publix, determines who can administer the shots and the number of doses it gets, Brous said. "It's supply and demand," she said. "It goes back to there's more demand than supply and that is frustrating, I'm sure." That can best be captured by how quickly the appointments fill up. When Publix opened up reservations for 48,900 appointments two weeks ago, the spots filled up in 2½ hours, Brous said. At any given time that morning, more than 300,000 people were in the website's virtual waiting room. Landing an appointment can feel like winning a lottery ticket . Vaccination sites have posted signs and taped recordings for phone lines, warning customers that there's no vaccine surplus and appointments are needed. At Publix, Florida residents must sign up online. This means, staring at a computer screen for hours, hitting refresh, to fill out forms. Appointments typically open up at 6 a.m., after the company confirms the number of doses it has and frees up slots based on that total. People wait in a virtual waiting room, which helps manage the heavy web traffic. If they get past that, they must move quickly to sign up for a spot before they fill up. The system has prompted frustration and concerns about access, especially for seniors who aren't tech savvy and don't have a neighbor or family member who can assist. Jeff Groob and his wife, Kathy, were among the hundreds of thousands who recently logged on shortly before 6 a.m. to get a spot his mother in West Palm Beach, Florida. Sitting in bed in their pajamas in Kentucky, they each pulled up Publix's website and stared at their laptops. Four other family members in other parts of the country did the same. They got lucky. A few days later, Lee Groob drove half a mile to her nearby Publix and got her first shot. "It was a huge weight lifted, a huge relief," Kathy Groob said. For Lee Groob, 87, the pandemic has been an isolating experience broken up only by Zoom calls with family, occasional socially distanced games of bridge on an outdoor patio and swimming laps in an outdoor pool. "I never realized how difficult it would be," she said. "You deal with it, but instead of getting better, it gets harder." With the first vaccination, she said she feels closer to being able to resume the activities she enjoyed before the pandemic like flying to visit her family, whom she hasn't seen in a year. But it also stirred up some jealousy among friends who are still waiting their turn, and felt the assistance she received gave her an advantage. "I think it's just because she didn't get it," Lee said, about the reaction a friend had. "She was online, too, and she was so desperate for it."
Apple on Wednesday announced its latest set of major donations as part of its $100 million initiative to help dismantle systemic barriers and promote racial equality for people of color. The company split the first round into three areas, including a $25 million donation to the Propel Center, a learning hub for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. It will also launch the Apple Developer Academy to support coding students in Detroit, and venture capital funding for Black and Brown founders. CEO Tim Cook announced the Racial Equity and Justice Initiative in June, following the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.	Apple on Wednesday announced its latest set of major donations as part of its $100 million initiative to help dismantle systemic barriers and promote racial equality for people of color.

It will also launch the Apple Developer Academy to support coding students in Detroit, and venture capital funding for Black and Brown founders. CEO Tim Cook announced the Racial Equity and Justice Initiative in June, following the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Lisa Jackson, the company's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, leads the program. Many large tech companies announced hefty donations to support racial equality over the summer, but Apple's was among the largest and it's one of the few to set up an initiative. In addition to its work with the Propel Center, Apple said it will also establish two grants to support HBCU engineering programs. The company will also offer scholarships to 100 new Apple Scholars from underrepresented communities, it said. The company expects to open its Detroit Apple Developer Academy later this year. In collaboration with Michigan State University, Apple said its Academy will offer two programs: A 30-day introductory program and a more intensive 10-to-12 month program. The company said it expects roughly 1,000 students each year. Also as part of its efforts, Apple will invest $10 million with Harlem Capital, an early-stage New York City VC firm, to help invest in 1,000 companies with diverse founders over the next 20 years. "The firm will offer guidance and mentorship to students at the Detroit Developer Academy and participants in Apple's Entrepreneur Camp for Black Founders and Developers. Apple will also support Harlem Capital's internship program, focused on opening doors for aspiring women and minority investors," the company said. Apple added it will invest $25 million in Siebert Williams Shank's Clear Vision Impact Fund, which provides capital to small and medium sized businesses, with an emphasis on minority-owned companies.

Clubhouse has carved out a niche among Black users, and as they have joined, they have innovated new ways for using the voice-chatting app. Clubhouse has not said how many users there are on the app, but SensorTower estimates that the app has seen approximately 1.3 million installs worldwide. What was once an app filled with the kind of networking you might hear at a tech dinner party in San Francisco has quickly been rounded out with the type of socializing you might catch at a barbershop in Atlanta.	Clubhouse, a social media app introduced in March,  allows users to gather in virtual rooms where they can communicate with one another through the mics on their iPhones. Because the app requires an invitation, early participants were mostly from the communities around its founder and funders -- basically, wealthy Silicon Valley venture capitalists and workers in the tech industry. As a consequence, the app heavily centered around conversations focused on tech and business, early users told CNBC. Think LinkedIn, but with audio instead of text. But as the app has grown, people of more diverse backgrounds have begun to join, and the Clubhouse experience has changed dramatically. In particular, the app has carved out a niche among Black users, who have innovated new ways for using it. A few months ago you might've opened the app to a panel discussion on the future of artificial intelligence or the potential of Bitcoin. Now, you'll still see the tech talk, but it'll be alongside debates over the music of rappers DMX and 50 Cent or the latest happening in the NBA. Nowadays, you can find folks shooting their shots in dating rooms, cracking jokes in virtual comedy clubs, talking about the latest celebrity gossip or having musical jam sessions with their friends. This sudden burst of innovation in Clubhouse exemplifies the role Black people often play in America as culture makers and trend setters, said Aniyia Williams, founder of Black & Brown Founders, an organization that supports Black and Latinx entrepreneurs. "That ingenuity is the other side of being oppressed. At the end of the day, that's the thing that unites Black people," Williams said. "Being a have-not forces you to think and see the world differently, and it makes Black people naturally creative and creators in ways that they're not even trying. It's just the way that they operate." Several Black users of the app told CNBC that they began to join in May and July. That was after Clubhouse secured a funding round from the firm Andreessen Horowitz that valued the company at approximately $100 million. The funding allowed the app to keep expanding, but it also gave Clubhouse two critical allies who helped diversify its user base. Felicia Horowitz, wife of investor Ben Horowitz and the founder of the Horowitz Family Foundation, and Chris Lyons, managing partner at the firm, both played key roles in inviting "heavy hitters" to Clubhouse, said Williams, who joined the app in July. Both are Black. "Clubhouse has done an incredible job of embracing the Black community as investors in the platform and helping us build a community on the platform," Horowitz told CNBC. Harold Hughes, a startup entrepreneur in Austin, Texas, joined the app in May. When Hughes joined, he noticed that there were often only one or two active rooms, but as more and more Black users joined the app, the number of rooms started to grow and so too did the creativity within those rooms. While rooms during the day focused on business and tech, more rooms began to open up late at night that were less serious and more playful. "It's been really interesting to see how Black creatives on the app have taken what exists and using it in unique and creative ways to further engagement with their audiences," said Hughes, who founded a group known as the Black Founders Club on Clubhouse. This included rooms where folks were just singing. Among them was Bomani X, an artist who was stuck at home in the middle of the pandemic, trying to figure out how he could continue to approach his art while isolated. Bomani joined the app in July, and as he got comfortable with it, he started to change how he used Clubhouse. First, he began to play his guitar in the background of the conversation rooms he joined. Then, he stopped talking and just started playing, creating rooms for solo concerts or playing with other musicians. Bomani also founded The Cotton Club, a group within Clubhouse. His experimentation with the app culminated last month when he teamed up with Noelle Chesnut Whitmore, a music marketing executive, and other users to produce a Clubhouse version of "The Lion King." The voice actors used the app to reenact songs from the movie and the musical, and it became a huge event on the app. They put on the musical twice, and both times, the Clubhouse rooms hit their maximum capacity of 5,000  almost immediately. "It was putting the time and energy in to really create a moment and bring joy to the Clubhouse community," Bomani said. We showcased "that this audio space can be used for not just conversations but also unique experiences." Clubhouse has a number of unique features that Black users have found alluring, said Melissa Brown, a Stanford postdoctoral researcher who specializes in Black digital life. The app requires users to connect their accounts to their iPhone numbers, and users of the app go by their real names, use an actual photo of themselves, and write a bio. This makes it nearly impossible for anyone to be anonymous. The use of photos is critical because it quickly gives users a sense of who is in the room. For Black users and allies, opening a Clubhouse room filled with other Black users may make them feel welcome. Conversely, someone who isn't comfortable around a large group of Black people might filter themselves out, Brown said. "People are very aware that if you're going to be in clearly named Black spaces, you have to be invited," Brown said. Users are also able to write open-ended bios about themselves. For Black users this can include their affiliation with organizations such as Black fraternities or sororities, Brown said. "Being able to signal Blackness offline and using it as a proxy online creates a density in the Black online social sphere," Brown said. "It's the fact that these dense networks exist that predispose Black people to amplify each other." Another critical feature is the fact that the audio from rooms is not saved. When people gather, it's essentially a one-time only event — you were either there or you missed it. That makes it possible for Black artists to create without worrying that what they make could be stolen without credit, as is often the case on other social apps. TikTok, for example, makes it very easy for users to appropriate audio or dance moves from a Black person and use it to their own benefit without citation. That is a form of Black erasure, Brown said. "Unless the technology forces you to give credit to the original, there's no incentive to do so," Brown said. "It's always Black people who have to say 'Hey, we did this first. Hey, this is our original idea.'" Besides "The Lion King," Bomani has also left his mark on Clubhouse in another significant way. As of Jan. 9, 2021, when you go to the App Store and search for Clubhouse, you'll see a photo of Bomani and his guitar as the app icon. Clubhouse uses members of its community as its app icon, switching the photo every few weeks. Bomani is not the first Black person to grace the app icon, but he was the first one to do so since the app joined Apple's App Store in September, he said. Bomani's presence on the icon immediately signals to Black users that this is an app where they are welcomed, and it stands in stark contrast to that of other social apps, like Twitter which uses a bird or Snapchat which goes with a ghost. "Bomani has used his creative ingenuity to build community on Clubhouse from the moment he arrived," a spokeswoman for the company said in a statement. "Users can often find him in a room practicing his guitar, keeping a tight door at the 'Cotton Club' or creating new musical experiences with other creators." Bomani said he has grown to appreciate his inclusion on the app icon, understanding how important representation matters in the tech industry. He's also heard from other users who have told him they only accepted their Clubhouse invite when they saw his face on the icon. "Seeing how much their action of putting me as the app icon also reflects the community and the culture that is pushing a lot of the innovation, I appreciated it," Bomani said. However, there are those in Clubhouse's Black community who wonder whether the company's relationship with their Black user base is genuine or just pandering. "It's great that they're recognizing [Bomani], but it's still a cosmetic change," Brown said. "Hopefully this means that we won't see differential censorship against Black rooms or not enough Black people being hired at the executive level or engineering roles." To this date, Clubhouse's founders have kept a low profile, doing little press or sharing much about the company. The company is listed as Alpha Exploration Co. on LinkedIn, and a search of the company's staffers on LinkedIn does not show that there are any Black employees yet. Asked if the company has any Black employees, the spokeswoman for the company said Clubhouse does not breakdown the demographics of its team. "Clubhouse is being built for everyone and we are intentional in cultivating and maintaining diversity and inclusivity within our team, investor base and advisors as well as the growing community on Clubhouse," the spokeswoman said in a statement. Founders Paul Davison and Rohan Seth, however, are noted for being active participants on the app and holding weekly rooms where they welcome new users as well as take feedback from the community. That feedback is often taken into consideration as the company develops updates, and the feedback is credited in the app's publicly listed build updates . "Specifically to the Black audience, we've been trying to figure out how to stay more connected with them," Hughes said. "I do think they're listening. I just think they haven't gotten to the point where they've got a dedicated person in our community saying 'Hey, how are we able to support the Black community?' But I'm willing to give them the space to figure that out." Some users, however, have remarked that not all feedback is treated equally. Feedback that lends itself to driving the app's growth or building new features seems to take priority over feedback that serves to help the app's marginalized users from racism, sexism, homophobia and other real-world issues, Bomani said. "Conversations about product are probably more in their ear versus conversations about how each community can live in their truths safely and as securely as possible," Bomani said. As Clubhouse continues to grow, Black users of the app hope the tech company will continue to build their relationship with their community and recognize their contributions. "I think they can do a better job, but I don't know what that job looks like," Bomani said. "But there's a lot of conversations that we have as a community about our role in social media. We always get the short end of the stick by creating the culture and pushing the popularity of these apps and platforms but not always having an equal share in equity."
The coronavirus pandemic triggered unprecedented economic contractions and job losses, exposing and worsening inequality around the world. Returning to a healthy economic environment will help alleviate some of those inequities, said David Wilcox of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Richard Yetsenga of ANZ Bank, however, noted that inequality was already a problem before Covid, even when many economies had low unemployment rates.	SINGAPORE — The coronavirus pandemic triggered unprecedented economic contractions and job losses, exposing and worsening inequality around the world. Global extreme poverty is set to rise for the first time in over 20 years, with Covid-19 forcing millions more to live on less than $1.90 a day, according to the World Bank. David Wilcox of the Peterson Institute for International Economics said economic downturns in the U.S. tend to be "inequality-exacerbating" and that this recession has "unique characteristics." He pointed to data which shows that employment rates for high-wage workers have returned to pre-Covid levels. Low-wage employment, however, is still down by nearly 20%. "A return, not so much to economic growth, but to a healthy economic situation overall will help alleviate the inequalities that have widened sharply this (past) year," Wilcox, a senior fellow at PIIE, told CNBC. "Once a vaccine has been widely administered, people will feel comfortable once again engaging in lots of activities that powered the service economy pre-pandemic," he said. That includes going to the gym, eating in restaurants, flying on planes and attending conferences. "All that will help reemploy a lot of the people who have been out of work since mid-March," he said. But Richard Yetsenga, chief economist of ANZ Bank, said economic growth may not be able to alleviate inequality beyond gains made through job creation. "More jobs is clearly something that can help inequality in the short term. But, before Covid many economies had quite (even very) low unemployment and yet inequality was already a problem," he said in an email. "Economic growth didn't solve the equity problem in most economies in the decade before Covid, and so something would need to be different to resolve it afterwards," he added. In a research note from November, Yetsenga said giant corporations have been the main beneficiaries of global growth over the past two decades. "But median wages have not increased the way we might have expected, and certainly not in a way that was consistent with historical experience," he wrote. Additionally, it is possible that, given the accelerated rate of digital adoption, inequality could worsen as economies progress. "The industrial revolution made us much wealthier, but inequality widened dramatically," Yetsenga said. "There are strong similarities with the digital revolution." IMF researchers found that new technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics could replace labor from developing countries and widen the gap between rich and poor countries. Yetsenga said inequality may be the "biggest policy challenge" after Covid, and accepting that it is a problem will be the first step to finding an answer. The next step is seeing growth and inequality as intertwined, instead of one being the solution to the other. He said aiming for greater GDP growth may appeal to some as the best way to solve inequality, but that approach is not likely to succeed. "Surely we can't keep striving for one (growth) and keep expecting the other (inequality) to magically resolve itself?" The PIIE's Wilcox said, beyond a healthy economy, countries could revamp their tax systems to be more progressive or invest in an equitable education system in the long run. "We can take advantage of historically low interest rates to undertake government investment in smart, targeted ways that not only employ lots of people but also meet other important social objectives," he added. A Brookings Institution article also said that policies must keep pace with technological advancements so that economic growth can be inclusive. "Is rising inequality an inevitable consequence of today's technology-driven economic transformations—and globalization? The answer is no," wrote Zia Qureshi, a visiting fellow at Brookings' global economy and development program. "With better, more responsive policies, more inclusive economic outcomes are possible," he said.
Starbucks is starting a new fund aimed at investing in community development projects and small businesses. The initiative is part of its broader commitment to racial and social equity, particularly in light of the coronavirus pandemic and Black Lives Matter protests. The coffee chain has also looked inward to make its workforce more diverse by setting targets for its management roles and tying executive compensation to those benchmarks.	Starbucks is starting a $100 million fund aimed at investing in community development projects and small businesses in areas populated by Black, Indigenous and people of color. The company's Community Resilience Fund is part of a broader plan to step up its commitment to racial and social equity, particularly in the communities where it operates cafes. In June, as Black Lives Matter protesters took to streets to push for an end to racism and police brutality, the Starbucks Foundation pledged $1 million in neighborhood grants, joining numerous companies that said they would give money to fight against racism. The foundation ultimately ended up giving out an additional $500,000 in grants. The coffee chain has also looked inward to make its workforce more diverse by setting targets for its management roles and tying executive compensation to those benchmarks. Starbucks plans to use the new fund to invest $100 million over the next four years in 12 U.S. cities with populations that are Black, Indigenous or people of color. The cities are Atlanta, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Philadelphia was where police in 2018 arrested two Black men who were waiting for a business meeting to start before ordering coffee, sparking boycotts and leading Starbucks to close down its company-owned cafes nationwide for one day of racial bias training. The money will go to impact-focused financial institutions, like community development financial institutions, which provide financial services to low-income people. Small businesses and neighborhood development projects are ultimately supposed to be the beneficiaries of the program. The goal is to help bridge the gap between the public and private sectors. Last year, many small businesses missed out on federal funding from the Paycheck Protection Program , which was intended to help them stay afloat during the coronavirus pandemic . "We know these communities. These are some of our business partners, and in some instances, they may even be a small supplier to Starbucks," Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer said. "And so when you think about that, and you can't help but have empathy for them, you want them to thrive as well, but also we understand what they're going through." In 2019, Starbucks pledged to invest $10 million in CFDIs based in Chicago. Brewer said the company is working with Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to make sure the money goes to what matters most, and Starbucks is already talking to the local governments of the areas that will benefit from the new fund. Starbucks' commitments to social causes, including racial justice and climate change , have made the company popular with investors who take into account environmental, social and corporate governance when picking stocks. Analysis from RBC Capital Markets found that Starbucks is the most popular restaurant stock on the S&P 500 with actively managed funds that are dedicated to ESG investing. Shares of Starbucks have risen 16% in the last year as of Monday's market close, giving the company a market value of $123 billion.
Bitcoin pro Isaiah Jackson said the cryptocurrency is a key way to fix economic injustice. He urged Black investors to get in on the digital coin as a way of saving in the long term. "For the first time in history, we have a Plan B option to the current financial system which has seen years of redlining, racial discrimination and other egregious acts by retail banks to the Black community," said Jackson, co-founder of KRBE Digital Assets Group and author of "Bitcoin & Black America."	Bitcoin pro Isaiah Jackson told CNBC on Tuesday that the cryptocurrency is a key way to fix economic injustice, and urged Black investors to get in on the digital coin as a way of long-term saving. "For the first time in history, we have a Plan B option to the current financial system which has seen years of redlining , racial discrimination and other egregious acts by retail banks to the Black community, and in my opinion, the Black community has the opportunity to shift our mindset and our money," said Jackson, co-founder of KRBE Digital Assets Group and author of "Bitcoin & Black America." "We can shift our energy into Bitcoin and cryptocurrency because there is no barrier to entry, it's unconfiscatable, which is something we have not seen in the history of the United States for the Black community, so I think Bitcoin is a step in the right direction and it can definitely help in the long term," Jackson said in an interview with " Squawk Alley ." Bitcoin's value vs. the U.S. dollar has more than tripled since mid-October, but dropped more than 10% on Monday , echoing the extreme volatility seen in 2018. However, Jackson doesn't view this week's drop as a concerning move for long-term holders. "The drop that we've seen recently is nothing more than market cycles," Jackson added. "If you're in Bitcoin as a savings account, as a way to preserve your wealth, then this volatility should not scare you at all." Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
Scottish National Party on course for 4th term in office. SNP plans independence referendum if it wins majority. UK PM Johnson rules out another secession vote.	The Scottish National Party (SNP), which has vowed to hold an independence referendum that could tear the United Kingdom apart should it be returned to power, will find out on Saturday if it has won a majority in Scotland's parliament. The SNP says it will seek to hold a new vote on secession if a pro-independence majority is returned to the devolved 129-seat parliament. This would set up a clash with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who says he will refuse any such vote because Scots backed staying in the United Kingdom in 2014. Initial results showed the SNP on course for a fourth consecutive term in office having triumphed in 40 of 49 seats declared so far, including in three key battlegrounds. But some areas saw an increase in support for opposition pro-union parties, indicating the final outcome would be very close. The final results will be announced later on Saturday. The electoral system - which allocates some seats on a proportional representation basis which helps smaller parties - might see the SNP fail to win an outright majority, something First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the party leader, acknowledged. "I have never taken that (an outright majority) for granted and it has always been on a knife edge," she said. There is likely still to be a pro-independence majority even if the SNP fall short because of the Green Party, which also supports secession. But supporters of the union argue that without an SNP majority, there is no mandate for a referendum. Scottish politics has been diverging from other parts of the United Kingdom for some time, but Scots remain divided over holding another polarizing vote on whether to end their country's 314-year union with England and Wales. Britain's exit from the European Union - a move opposed by a majority of Scots - as well as a perception that Sturgeon's government has handled the COVID-19 crisis well and antipathy to Johnson's Conservative government in London, have all bolstered support for Scotland's independence movement. Scots voted by 55%-45% in 2014 to remain part of the United Kingdom, and Johnson says that was a "once in a generation" vote. Polls suggest the outcome of a second referendum would be too tight to call. The British government says Johnson must approve any vote for it to be legal and he has made clear no such approval would be forthcoming. "I think a referendum in the current context is irresponsible and reckless," he told the Daily Telegraph newspaper. Sturgeon herself has ruled out holding any vote until after the COVID-19 pandemic, with the SNP indicating it would be held by the end of 2023. She argues there would be no moral or democratic justification for Johnson to refuse a referendum if the Scottish parliament passes a bill to hold a vote. "The results are looking like what we expected, that with the Scottish Greens there will be a pro-independence majority in the Scottish parliament and we take that as a clear mandate from the Scottish people to hold another referendum," Lorna Slater, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, told the BBC. "I think Boris Johnson doesn't want a referendum because he knows he's going to lose." With Sturgeon ruling out holding an illegal or wildcat plebiscite, it is likely that the issue will ultimately be decided by Britain's top court.
Europe's medicines regulator on Wednesday said it still believes the benefits of Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine outweigh the risks of side effects. It comes shortly after the U.S. FDA asked states to temporarily pause using J&J's vaccine "out of an abundance of caution" after six cases of a blood clotting disorder were detected among more than 6.8 million doses of the shot. The European Medicines Agency said it is currently investigating all the reported cases and will decide whether regulatory action is required.	LONDON — Europe's medicines regulator on Wednesday said it still believes the benefits of Johnson & Johnson 's Covid-19 vaccine outweigh the risks of side effects following reports of extremely rare blood clotting. It comes shortly after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked states to temporarily pause using J&J's vaccine "out of an abundance of caution" after six cases of a blood clotting disorder were detected among more than 6.8 million doses of the shot. All six cases occurred in the U.S. in women, aged between 18 and 48, with symptoms developing six to 13 days after they received the shot. The FDA said one woman died as a result of blood clotting complications and another is in a critical condition. The European Medicines Agency said it is currently investigating all the reported cases and will decide whether regulatory action is required. "The EMA is currently expediting this evaluation and currently expects to issue a recommendation next week," Europe's medicines regulator said in a statement. "While its review is ongoing, EMA remains of the view that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks of side effects." South Africa has halted its rollout of the shot, while J&J said it would "proactively delay" deliveries of its vaccine to Europe, which started last week. The vaccine was authorized in the EU on March 11, but the widespread use of the shot has not yet started. "Right now, these adverse events appear to be extremely rare," the FDA said on Tuesday in a joint statement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "COVID-19 vaccine safety is a top priority for the federal government, and we take all reports of health problems following COVID-19 vaccination very seriously." Last week, Europe's medicines regulator said it found a possible link between the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford and rare blood clotting issues. AstraZeneca has not received authorization for use in the U.S. The Oxford-AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines work in similar ways and both use an adenovirus, a common type of virus that typically causes mild cold symptoms.
The French capital and parts of the north of the country will enter a new lockdown Friday, although schools and essential shops will stay open. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel had announced an easing of lockdowns in March. But German Health Minister Jens Spahn told a news conference Friday that the easing may have to be reversed.	LONDON — Warnings of an exponential rise in infections for Germany and a fresh monthlong lockdown in Paris have underlined the dire situation across Europe as the coronavirus surges once again. The variant first discovered in the U.K. is seen as the reason for the new spike. The strain is reported to be much more virulent than the original one. The French capital and northern parts of the country will enter a new lockdown Friday, although schools and essential shops will stay open. The country's seven-day average of new coronavirus cases rose above 25,000 this week for the first time since November. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel had announced an easing of lockdowns in March. That was when the number of infections per 100,000 people over seven days was at 65. But that number is now at 96 and there are real fears that infections at Easter could mirror what they were at Christmas. "The rising case numbers may mean that we cannot take further opening steps in the weeks to come," German Health Minister Jens Spahn told a news conference Friday, according to Reuters. "On the contrary, we may even have to take steps backwards." Italy has already put Easter plans on hold with a new national lockdown announced by Prime Minister Mario Draghi . The country has the sixth-highest death toll in the world with at least 103,855 fatalities, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Poland has also seen a huge surge in infections with approximately 52% of new cases linked to the variant from Britain, according to Reuters. Total cases for the country pushed passed 2 million on Friday with 25,998 in the last 24 hours. The surge comes as EU nations try to press ahead with their vaccination campaigns, which have so far underperformed compared with the likes of those in the U.S. and the U.K. Supply and procurement issues have been blamed and the rollout of the AstraZeneca -Oxford vaccine was halted this week while the EU's health regulator, the European Medicines Agency, carried out an investigation into blood clots. On Friday, Germany's Spahn also warned that there are not enough vaccines in Europe to prevent this third wave. — CNBC's Bryn Bache contributed to this article.
Europe is continuing to struggle with the virus amid a third wave of infections and ramping up of lockdown measures. The region is dealing with a surge in cases more than a year after the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic. At the same time, the bloc's vaccination rollout remains sluggish, hit by manufacturing issues and supply snags. European Union leaders are meeting this week to discuss possible vaccine export bans.	More than a year after the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic, Europe is continuing to struggle with the virus amid a third wave of infections and ramping up of lockdown measures. At the same time, the bloc's vaccination rollout remains sluggish, hit by manufacturing issues and supply snags, to the extent that European Union leaders are meeting this week to discuss — once again — the introduction of possible vaccine export bans. It comes as a handful of countries re-introduce lockdowns to curb a third wave of infections, with France, Poland and Ukraine all implementing stricter measures at the weekend that are set to last several weeks at least. A month-long partial lockdown was reintroduced in Paris Saturday, as well as in 15 other regions in France, in an effort to get on top of rising case numbers, largely attributed to new, more infectious Covid variants. The latest partial lockdown is less stringent than previous ones , however, prompting some to question the point of such a move, while others have said that the new measures are confusing. A curfew is still in place and inter-regional travel remains effectively banned. Around 21 million people in France are affected by the new rules. The country reported over 30,000 new daily cases on Sunday, bringing the country's total number of infections to over 4.2 million. Over 92,000 people have died due to the virus in France to date. Meanwhile, Europe's largest economy Germany could be set to extend a national lockdown into April as the country also battles a third wave of Covid-19 cases. Several states have reportedly called for an extension to current restrictions as the Covid incidence rate passed 100 cases per 100,000 people, a level the government previously said would prompt it to implement an "emergency brake" — a stalling of the lifting of lockdown measures — to prevent further spread. The move would be a blow for Germany that had started to ease lockdown measures, allowing schools to reopen in February and some non-essential shops to admit customers again earlier this month. As much of the EU experiences rising coronavirus cases, the bloc's vaccine rollout remains sluggish and contentious. EU leaders are set to meet virtually on Thursday to discuss whether to block vaccine exports while supplies within the region remain in short supply, and its vaccination program lags behind those in other developed nations. The EU was criticized for bulk-ordering coronavirus vaccines later than the U.K. and U.S., and has subsequently had to deal with supply issues, despite two of the vaccines it has authorized for use — the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca-University of Oxford shots — being manufactured in the EU. There are reports that the EU could block exports of the AstraZeneca vaccine being made at a Dutch plant — a move that could also jeopardize the U.K.'s so-far successful vaccine rollout. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to reach out to his European counterparts to try to resolve the impasse over vaccines. The rollout of the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine has faced several hurdles in recent weeks, with a handful of European countries suspending use of the shot due to concerns over a possible link to reports of blood clots. The World Health Organization and European Medicines Agency conducted safety reviews into the vaccine with the latter ruling last Thursday that it is safe and effective and the benefits outweigh any risks. The conclusion prompted a reversal of the vaccine's suspension from most (but not all) of the European countries that had stopped its use, but the move could damage public confidence in the vaccine, which was already shaky due to misplaced questions over the efficacy of the shot in the over-65s. Real-world data has since proven the vaccine is highly effective at reducing severe Covid cases, hospitalizations and deaths in adults. The vaccine got another boost on Monday when the results of a large U.S. trial were published showing that the AstraZeneca vaccine is 79% effective in preventing symptomatic illness and 100% effective against severe disease and hospitalization . However, a YouGov poll published on Monday showed that the decision of some European nations to suspend use of the AstraZeneca vaccine has "hugely damaged public perceptions of the vaccine's safety in Europe." The poll, conducted in seven European countries (the U.K., Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Denmark and Sweden) between March 15-18 found that people were more likely to see the vaccine as unsafe than safe in France, Germany, Spain and Italy. It should be noted that the survey was conducted during the week when the vaccine's safety credentials were being questioned and mostly before the EMA published its safety ruling on the shot.
European officials are worried that any future issues could undermine their vaccination targets. In January, the EU approved restrictions on exports of Covid vaccines, but they can only be implemented if a company is not respecting its contractual obligations with the region and if the vaccines are heading to a country considered not vulnerable. However, the legislation is due to expire at the end of March.	LONDON — Tensions are high between the U.K. and the European Union as the 27-member bloc considers restricting exports of Covid-19 vaccines across the English Channel. The European Union is increasingly frustrated at AstraZeneca for not respecting its delivery targets to the bloc. The pharmaceutical firm reduced the number of vaccines it will deliver to the EU twice in the first quarter and once in the second quarter. As a result, European officials are worried that any future issues could undermine their vaccination targets. AstraZeneca has met its delivery targets for the United Kingdom — where the vaccination rate is higher than in the EU — even though some of these vaccines are coming from plants in the European Union. The U.K. placed its order for the AstraZeneca shots earlier than the EU. "The EU needs to secure deliveries of vaccines to Europeans in line with companies' contractual obligations. We will review the different tools at our disposal for that end, including the use of the export authorization regime in its current or in adapted form," a spokesperson for the European Commission told CNBC on Monday. In late January, the EU approved restrictions on exports of Covid-19 vaccines, but they can only be implemented if a company is not respecting its contractual obligations with the region and if the vaccines are heading to a country considered not vulnerable. This is what enabled Italy to stop a shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines to Australia a couple of weeks ago — the only instance of European authorities preventing Covid shots from leaving the region. However, the legislation is due to expire at the end of March . "There is an ongoing reflection process in the EU, and we will be consulting Member States. All options are on the table," the European Commission spokesperson added via email.  The issue is expected to be discussed by the 27 heads of state on Thursday during a European summit. Speaking to a group of newspapers over the weekend, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: "We have the possibility to forbid planned exports. That is the message to AstraZeneca, 'you fulfil your contract with Europe before you start delivering to other countries'." Von der Leyen had already asked for tougher export restrictions last week. "We will reflect on whether exports to countries who have higher vaccination rates than us are still proportionate," she said on Wednesday. As of last week, the European Union exported 41 million doses of Covid shots to 33 countries. The biggest recipient has been the U.K. The U.K. government did not confirm when contacted by CNBC on Monday whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson was due to speak with European leaders about vaccine exports. A spokesperson for the prime minister said later Monday that the U.K. government believes in the importance of countries not placing export restrictions on vaccines and that nations should work together, Reuters reported. However, the U.K.'s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, told Sky News on Sunday that blocking vaccines would be "counterproductive" and hurt the EU's reputation. Pfizer , whose vaccine has been used the most across the EU so far, reportedly said the region should not block the export of Covid shots because the company needs raw materials from the U.K. Imposing restrictions on the vaccines could lead the U.K. to retaliate by preventing ingredients from getting to EU plants. A spokesperson for Pfizer told CNBC on Monday that its position is aligned with the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, which said in January that export bans risk retaliatory measures "given the global nature of vaccine supply lines." The U.K. aims to finish vaccinating its adult population with the first dose of Covid shots by July. Despite a "tough" start to the rollout in the European Union, as described by von der Leyen last week, the bloc also intends to reach herd immunity by mid-July. "By July 14, we have the opportunity to reach immunity," Thierry Breton, European commissioner for internal market, told French TV channel TF1 on Sunday. The EU's objective will depend on the fulfillment of delivery contracts by four pharmaceutical firms and on the member states' ability to vaccinate their populations.
The European Union on Monday imposed sanctions on four Chinese officials accused of responsibility for abuses against Uyghur Muslims in a raft of measures targeting alleged human rights offenders around the world, despite warnings that Beijing could retaliate. The four are senior officials in the northwest region of Xinjiang. The sanctions involve a freeze on their assets in the EU and a ban on them traveling in the bloc.	The European Union on Monday imposed sanctions on four Chinese officials accused of responsibility for abuses against Uyghur Muslims in a raft of measures targeting alleged human rights offenders around the world, despite warnings that Beijing could retaliate. The four are senior officials in the northwest region of Xinjiang. The sanctions involve a freeze on their assets in the EU and a ban on them traveling in the bloc. European citizens and companies are not permitted to provide them with financial assistance. China at first denied the existence of camps for detaining Uyghurs in Xinjiang but has since described them as centers to provide job training and reeducate those exposed to radical jihadi thinking. Officials deny all charges of human rights abuses there. Xinjiang had been a hotbed of anti-government violence, but Beijing claims its massive security crackdown brought peace in recent years. China's Foreign Ministry responded immediately, denouncing the sanctions as "based on nothing but lies and disinformation" and issuing its own retaliatory measures. The ministry announced sanctions against 10 individuals and four institutions that it said had damaged China's interests and "maliciously spread lies and disinformation." They and their family members would be barred from entering mainland China, Hong Kong or Macao and cut off from financial dealings with those areas, the ministry said. Among those targeted was Adrian Zenz, a U.S.-based German scholar who has publicized abuses against minority groups in China's western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. China has said companies and individuals have petitioned to sue Zenz, but it wasn't clear who the plaintiffs were or how they would pursue legal action across borders. Others targeted for sanctions include five members of the European Parliament: Reinhard Butikofer, Michael Gahler, Raphael Glucksmann, Ilhan Kyuchyuk and Miriam Lexmann. The ministry did not say what specific measures would be taken against the organizations. They were listed as the Political and Security Committee of the Council of the European Union, where the 27 national envoys decide foreign and security policy; the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights; the German-based Mercator Institute for China Studies; and the Alliance of Democracies Foundation in Denmark. Last week, China's ambassador to the EU, Zhang Ming, suggested that Beijing would retaliate. "We want dialogue, not confrontation. We ask the EU side to think twice. If some insist on confrontation, we will not back down, as we have no options other than fulfilling our responsibilities to the people in our country," he said. The new EU sanction system is similar to the Magnitsky Act — Obama-era legislation that authorizes the U.S. government to sanction those it sees as human rights offenders, freeze their assets and ban them from entering the United States. EU foreign ministers, as part of Monday's move, also imposed sanctions over repression in North Korea, "extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances in Libya, torture and repression against LGBTI persons and political opponents in Chechnya in Russia, and torture, extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and killings in South Sudan and Eritrea," a statement said.
President Joe Biden signed a massive fiscal stimulus plan that will send direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans. The OECD estimated earlier this month that the relief bill will add about 1 percentage point to global growth this year. European officials often come under criticism for not providing similar fiscal power.	LONDON — The $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package in the United States is a "significant engine for the world economy" and will have positive spillover effects in the euro zone, the chief economist of the European Central Bank told CNBC. Earlier this month, President Joe Biden signed a massive fiscal stimulus plan that will send direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans. The program, which is already underway, is expected to prop up the world economy. In fact, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated this month that the relief bill will add about 1 percentage point to global growth this year. And the euro zone is expecting to benefit from that too. "There will be positive spillovers from the U.S., the fact that there is a significant stimulus in the U.S. will boost global GDP, will boost exports from the euro area," ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane told CNBC's Annette Weisbach Monday. A large part of the economic output in the euro area is driven by exports, which were severely hit by the pandemic. Data released in January showed that euro zone exports dropped 11.4% over a 12-month period. "Of course, the initial impact was visible more in the financial market, but over time, as this stimulus gets rolled out, it will be a significant engine for the world economy," Lane added. European officials often come under criticism for not providing similar fiscal power to the United States. The 27 European nations, for example, agreed in July to implement a 750 billion euro ($895 billion) joint stimulus, but those funds have not yet been distributed. "Given the nature of the U.S. you can have very large fiscal packages embodied in a single piece of legislation. As you know in the European situation we've a mix, we have 19 fiscal policies and then we have the joint fiscal action," Lane said. Lane pointed to a recent meeting among euro zone finance ministers, where there were commitments to "an agile fiscal response" with no early exit. At the same meeting, European officials also said that it is likely that stricter budgetary targets will remain on hold in 2022, so member states will continue to have the capacity to address the economic challenges of the coronavirus pandemic. The euro area has been severely hit by the health emergency, having contracted almost 7% in 2020. Though the ECB has forecast a growth rate of 4% for the euro area this year, this comes with a large level of uncertainty. The economic performance will depend on the evolution of the pandemic, including new variants; as well as the vaccination rollout, which has been difficult for the EU so far. In addition, some EU nations are currently facing the start of a third wave of infections and have therefore imposed tougher restrictions on movement. In this context, whether at the national or European level, Lane suggested that member states might soon be discussing how to provide more help for their populations. "The parameters of the fiscal debate have clearly moved with the U.S. decision. And it is an important issue for European policymakers to reflect upon about how to calibrate the European fiscal response, and to make sure it's sufficient to get through this pandemic," Lane said.
There are increasing signs that the British public are growing frustrated with the restrictions, with anti-lockdown protests hitting the capital at the weekend. The vaccination rollout has been a silver lining in a pandemic that hit the U.K. hard.	LONDON — When the first coronavirus lockdown was imposed across the U.K. exactly a year ago, most would have struggled to conceive that, 12 months on, restrictions on public and private life would still be in place. With that now a reality, there are increasing signs that the British public are growing frustrated with the constraints, with anti-lockdown protests hitting the capital at the weekend. Although the U.K. has laid out a roadmap for the lifting of restrictions, with the government aiming to ease most Covid curbs by June 21, there have been smoke signals over the last few days that the government doesn't expect normal life to resume even then. Government ministers, and health experts advising them, have made a number of comments suggesting that summer vacations are now "highly unlikely" given the situation in other parts of Europe where coronavirus cases are rising due to new variants of the virus. Another health expert — the head of immunization at Public Health England — suggested Sunday that masks and social-distancing measures could be required for several years . The government has also signaled it wants to extend its authority to reverse any easing of measures and, thanks to support from the opposition Labour party, is expected to receive approval to extend emergency powers until October, despite a group of lawmakers within the ruling Conservative Party describing the move as "authoritarian." Combine these factors and a summer of freedom for the U.K. public is starting look more unlikely, potentially setting the stage for more public discontent as Brits become desperate to return to "normality." Especially as the vaccine rollout continues at pace; on Saturday, a record-breaking combined total of 844,285 first and second doses were given to those in line for the shot, up from 711,157 people receiving a vaccine dose on Friday. March 23 is the first anniversary of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's announcement to the British public that the country would go into lockdown, with the government implementing unprecedented measures in peacetime that were designed to stop the spread of the coronavirus that had first emerged in the then-largely unheard of Chinese city, Wuhan, in December 2019. Then, when Johnson made the first "stay-at-home" announcement, one that citizens have now become used to, the U.K. had reported a daily jump in the number of deaths caused by the virus, with 335 fatalities over 24 hours with hospitals and health care staff grappling to understand Covid-19 and effective treatments. Fast forward a year and the U.K. has the ignominious position of having recorded the fifth-highest number of coronavirus cases in the world, after the U.S., Brazil, India and Russia, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. To date, the U.K. has reported over 4.3 million infections, and over 126,000 deaths — the fifth highest number of deaths globally after the U.S., Brazil, Mexico and India. A minute's silence will be held in the U.K. on Tuesday to reflect on the deaths caused by the virus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement that "the last 12 months has taken a huge toll on us all, and I offer my sincere condolences to those who have lost loved ones." He added that the country had shown "great spirit shown by our nation over this past year." The reasons behind the higher death toll in the U.K., compared to its continental counterparts in mainland Europe, are manifold but underlying factors include a higher rate of obesity, preexisting health conditions and socio-economic factors. The government, for its part, has come in for intense criticism that it locked down too late, failed to implement border controls and checks on incoming travelers to the U.K., did not adequately protect health care workers and presided over an inadequate test and trace system still considered sub-par. In sum, it's been accused of not being prepared for a pandemic, and for mismanaging one when it arrived. One bright spot, and a saving grace, has been the U.K.'s highly-regarded scientific community which has been at the forefront of research into the virus, its effects and trials looking at the best way to combat it. In June 2020, for example, U.K. health experts led by the University of Oxford discovered that a low-cost steroid treatment, Dexamethasone, could greatly lower the risk of death when given to the most critically-ill Covid patients. An even bigger breakthrough came when the University of Oxford and Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical AstraZeneca , successfully developed and trialed one of a handful of effective vaccines, with the shot's creation even more remarkable given that it can take years to develop vaccines. U.K. vaccine research was boosted by government funding too. The U.K. was the first country in the world to approve and deploy the Pfizer - BioNTech vaccine back in early December, and quickly initiated a national immunization program that has gathered pace. In January, the AstraZeneca vaccine was added to the arsenal and the vaccination program went from strength to strength, surprising even the most cynical Brits and winning the country's heath experts and National Health Service plaudits for the bold decision-making, and a well-managed rollout. Unlike other countries in Europe, who erroneously questioned the AstraZeneca vaccine's efficacy in the over-65s, the U.K. went ahead with mass immunizations with the elderly and health care workers prioritized. Health experts also took the view (criticized at the time but now replicated in other countries) that the gap between the first and second doses of the coronavirus vaccines being deployed should be elongated up to 12 weeks in order to offer more initial protection to more people. The decision was vindicated by later clinical data showing that the strategy was effective and even increased the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The rollout has exceeded expectations; as of March 20, over 27.6 million British adults have received a first dose of a vaccine, and over 2.2 million have had their second shot, according to government data . There is palpable restlessness among members of the public — particularly those opposed to lockdown in the first place — as well the business community, for society to reopen. Anti-lockdown protests in London last weekend attracted several thousand demonstrators who chanted "Freedom!" as they marched through the capital. Later, scuffles between the police and demonstrators led to over 30 arrests. So, when it comes to the vaccine, it has been a case of "so far, so good." The U.K. has seen the benefit with the number of new cases, hospitalizations and deaths steadily decreasing. The speed of the rollout has been seen as critical, at a time when new variants of the virus have emerged and threatened to potentially undermine the positive effects of the vaccines. Mainland Europe is seeing the ramifications of its perhaps understandably slower rollout given the fact that the EU chose to order vaccines as a bloc and, crucially, ordered later than the U.K. and U.S. As well as slower supplies and production issues, the EU has had to contend with vaccine hesitancy, which is not prevalent in the U.K., and bureaucracy, again a factor not so much of an issue in Britain where the health care service is largely a joined-up and well-connected centralized system. But this week the U.K. faces a potential challenge to its rollout if EU leaders, meeting virtually Thursday, decide to block exports of Covid vaccines made in the bloc to countries, like the U.K., that are further ahead in their immunization programs. Johnson has reportedly sought to allay such a move, speaking to his counterparts in France and Germany at the weekend. But if the EU goes ahead, the U.K. could face further supply bottlenecks ; it is already expecting a supply shortage due to a reported delay in exports from an Indian manufacturing facility. Delays could cost Britain its so-far successful rollout, and citizens their liberties, although the government has so far said it still plans to have offered a first dose of a vaccine to all adults by July 31.
Exit polls indicate there is no clear winner in Tuesday's Israeli election, leaving Netanyahu's fate uncertain and signalling continued deadlock. The exit polls conducted by Channels 11, 12 and 13 were nearly identical, showing Netanyahu and his allies with 53-54 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, Israel's parliament. If the final results are in line with the exit polls, both sides will have to court Bennett, a former Netanyahu ally with strained relations with the prime minister, to form a majority of at least 61 seats.	Exit polls indicate there is no clear winner in Tuesday's Israeli election, leaving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fate uncertain and signalling continued political deadlock. The polls on Israel's three main TV stations showed Netanyahu and his religious and nationalist allies, as well as diverse array of opponents, both falling short of a parliamentary majority. That could set the stage for weeks of paralysis and even an unprecedented fifth consecutive election. Exit polls are often imprecise and the official results may not be known for days. The exit polls conducted by Channels 11, 12 and 13 were nearly identical, showing Netanyahu and his allies with 53-54 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, Israel's parliament. His opponents were projected to win 59, and Naftali Bennett's Yamina party was projected to win 7-8. If the final results are in line with the exit polls, both sides will have to court Bennett, a former Netanyahu ally with strained relations with the prime minister, to form a majority of at least 61 seats. Bennett shares Netanyahu's hard-line nationalist ideology but has signalled he would be open to co-operating with his rivals if given the chance to be prime minister. The election is widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu's divisive rule, and once again, opinion polls had forecast an extremely tight race. The three-month campaign was largely devoid of substantive issues and focused heavily on Netanyahu's personality and whether he should remain in office. In contrast to past elections where he faced off against a clear rival, this time a diverse array of parties is trying to topple him, having little in common beyond their shared animosity toward him. "Vote, vote, vote, vote, vote," Netanyahu said after casting his ballot in Jerusalem, his wife, Sara, at his side. Netanyahu, 71, who even after 12 years in office remains a tireless campaigner, continued throughout the day. At one point, he marched along a Mediterranean beach imploring people over a megaphone to go vote. "This is the moment of truth for the state of Israel," said one of his challengers, opposition leader Yair Lapid, as he voted in Tel Aviv. Netanyahu has emphasized Israel's highly successful coronavirus vaccination campaign. He moved aggressively to secure enough vaccines for Israel's 9.3 million people, and in three months the country has vaccinated some 80% of its adult population. That has enabled the government to open restaurants, stores and the airport just in time for election day. He also has tried to portray himself as a global statesman, pointing to the four diplomatic accords he reached with Arab countries last year. Those agreements were brokered by his close ally, then-President Donald Trump. Netanyahu's opponents, including a trio of former aides who share his nationalistic ideology but object to what they say is his autocratic leadership style, see things far differently. They say that Netanyahu bungled many aspects of the pandemic, particularly by allowing his ultra-Orthodox allies to ignore lockdown rules and fuel a high infection rate for much of the year. Over 6,000 Israelis have died from COVID-19, and the economy remains in weak shape with double-digit unemployment. They also point to Netanyahu's corruption trial, saying someone who is under indictment for serious crimes is not fit to lead the country. Netanyahu has been charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals that he dismisses as a witch hunt by a hostile media and legal system. Even Netanyahu's reputation as a statesman has suffered a bit in recent days. The United Arab Emirates, the most important of the four Arab nations to establish official diplomatic ties with Israel, last week made clear that it did not want to be used as part of Netanyahu's re-election bid after he was forced to call off a visit to the country. The Biden administration also has kept its distance, a contrast to the support he received in past elections from Trump. In a reminder of the country's many security challenges, Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip fired a rocket into Israel late Tuesday, setting off air raid sirens in southern Israel. The Israeli military said the rocket landed in an open space. Opinion polls forecast a tight race, with a possibility of both Netanyahu and his opponents falling short of securing a parliamentary majority yet again. That could plunge the country into an unprecedented fifth consecutive election later this year. Tuesday's election was sparked by the disintegration of an emergency government formed last May between Netanyahu and his chief rival at the time. The alliance was plagued by infighting, and elections were forced after they failed to agree on a budget in December. "It would be better if we didn't have to vote, you know, four times in two years," said Jerusalem voter Bruce Rosen. "It's a little bit tiring." By 6 p.m. (1600 GMT), 51.5% of eligible voters had cast ballots, a drop of nearly 5 percentage points from the previous election a year ago, the Israeli election commission announced. Netanyahu's opponents have accused him of fomenting deadlock in hopes of bringing about a friendlier parliament that will grant him immunity from prosecution. Netanyahu is hoping to form a government with his traditional religious and hard-line nationalist allies. These include a pair of ultra-Orthodox parties and a small religious party that includes openly racist and homophobic candidates. This time, much will depend on the performance of a handful of small parties struggling to win the minimum 3.25% of the vote to enter the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament. While Netanyahu's Likud was expected to emerge as the largest single party, no party has ever won a 61-seat majority on its own. Both he and his rivals must win the support of smaller allied parties to form a majority coalition. Recent polls have forecast that several parties were hovering near the electoral threshold. A failure by any one of them to enter the parliament would have a significant impact on the balance between Netanyahu and his opponents. Another complicating factor was absentee balloting. Up to 15% of the electorate was expected to vote outside their home districts, a larger-than-usual number due to special accommodations for those with COVID-19 or in quarantine. The government set up special polling stations and even brought ballot boxes to hospital bedsides to allow people to vote safely. Those votes are tallied separately in Jerusalem, meaning final results may not be known for days. Given the tight race, it could be difficult to predict the outcome before the final count is complete. After the results come in, attention will turn to the country's figurehead president, Reuven Rivlin. He will hold a series of meetings with party leaders and then choose the one he believes has the best chance of forming a government as his prime minister-designate. That task is usually, but not always, given to the head of the largest party. That will set off weeks of horse-trading as the prime minister-designate tries to cobble together a government with promises of generous budgets and powerful ministries to his would-be partners. Voting in Jerusalem on Tuesday, Rivlin said the deadlock has had a price. "Four elections in two years erode public trust in the democratic process," he said, even as he urged Israelis to vote again. "There is no other way."
Russia does have a number of logistical challenges to overcome when rolling out a vaccine. It is the largest country in the world and has a population of around 144 million people spread across a territory that spans Europe and northern Asia.	LONDON — Russian President Vladimir Putin received a coronavirus shot on Tuesday, as intrigue surrounds the country's vaccine strategy. Earlier in the day, the Kremlin said it would not reveal the name of the vaccine that Putin would receive, only that it would be one of three Russian-made shots. "We are deliberately not saying which shot the president will get, noting that all three Russian vaccines are absolutely reliable and effective," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to Reuters. There are three Russian vaccines — Sputnik V, EpiVacCorona and CoviVac — with the latter two only recently gaining emergency approval. The 68-year-old Russian president received the vaccine Tuesday evening, according to local media reports. It's unclear whether he was filmed receiving the shot. Peskov noted that Putin did not like the idea of being vaccinated on camera. The vaccination comes as the spotlight falls on the country's vaccine strategy. On Monday, Putin lauded multimillion dollar international sales of Russia's Sputnik V Covid vaccine but the country's own rollout appears sluggish, and contrasts sharply with the high numbers of vaccines destined for the international market . There have been reports that Russia's own production capacity is low and Putin appeared to concur. He said Monday that Russia needed to ramp up vaccine production for domestic use and that supplying domestic needs was a priority, according to Reuters. He noted that 4.3 million people in the country had already received two doses of the vaccine. This is substantially higher than, for example, the U.K. which has given around 2.3 million people both doses to date, but Russia was the first country in the world to approve a coronavirus vaccine (Sputnik V) in August — the U.K. approved its first shot in early December. Russia does have a number of logistical challenges to overcome when rolling out a vaccine. It is the largest country in the world and has a population of around 144 million people spread across a territory that spans Europe and northern Asia. In early March, Putin noted that all but nine Russian regions had started to deploy the vaccine, with delays linked to "problems with logistics, distribution (and) locations," the Moscow Times reported. Global data on vaccination programs shows that Russia lags many other countries in its own domestic rollout, with the number of single doses administered in Russia hovering just above the number of those given in Bangladesh, according to Our World in Data. The vaccination data is made more salient given that Russia has been hit so badly by the pandemic: It has recorded the fourth-highest number of cases in the world (over 4.4 million) and over 94,000 people have died from Covid in the country, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Another big issue hampering Russia's rollout is vaccine hesitancy among its citizens. Daragh McDowell, head of Europe and principal Russia analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, told CNBC the country's lower vaccination numbers are, "probably much more a result of lack of willingness on the part of popular skepticism over the vaccine than a lack of supply." He noted that the latest data from the Levada Center, an independent pollster in Russia, suggests that only 30% of Russians "are willing to get vaccinated, a number that's actually gone down since last year." "This is mainly due to worries about side effects and that the vaccine hasn't been tested enough — in other words, while the Kremlin got a propaganda boost from getting the vaccine out first, this was at the cost of doubts over its safety," McDowell said. Sputnik V was initially authorized in Russia only for people 18-60 years old, meaning that Putin was too old to receive it. Further trials in senior citizens found that the vaccine was safe in people age 60 and over, so that age group can now receive the shot. "The fact that Putin has waited this long to be vaccinated himself will not have gone unnoticed and will have contributed to these doubts," McDowell added. "The president's vaccination will convince some Russians of the vaccine's efficacy and safety (but) high levels of social distrust and conspiratorial thinking will blunt it's impact." He noted that the same polling data that showed 30% of Russians were willing to get vaccinated also revealed that almost two-thirds believed Covid was artificially developed as a biological weapon. Another aspect of Russia's vaccine program that's drawing attention is the high numbers of international sales of its vaccine. On Monday, Putin confirmed that Russia had signed international sales deals for Sputnik V doses for 700 million people. RDIF, Russia's sovereign wealth fund, which backed Sputnik V's development and deployment, said Tuesday that Sputnik V had now been approved in 56 countries, with Vietnam the latest to join the list . Several countries in Eastern Europe, such as Hungary and Slovakia, have also ordered Sputnik V doses . Meanwhile, Europe's medicines regulator started a rolling review of Sputnik V earlier this month. Verisk Maplecroft's McDowell said that although exports of 700 million doses was "an extremely ambitious number," it likely includes doses produced abroad, in India and South Korea for example, under license. Russia's Sputnik V vaccine was approved by Russia's health regulator in August before clinical trials were concluded, prompting skepticism among experts that it might not meet strict safety and efficacy standards. Some experts argued that the Kremlin was eager to claim victory in the race to develop a Covid vaccine, a charge it leveled at other countries. Russia has repeatedly said its vaccine is the target of anti-Russian sentiment. Russia appeared to be vindicated in early February,  when an interim analysis of phase 3 clinical trials of the shot, involving 20,000 participants, was published in the peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet . It found that the vaccine was 91.6% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 infection. In an accompanying article, Ian Jones, a professor of virology at the University of Reading, England, noted that "the development of the Sputnik V vaccine has been criticized for unseemly haste. But the outcome reported here is clear and the scientific principle of vaccination is demonstrated, which means another vaccine can now join the fight to reduce the incidence of Covid-19."
Officials are concerned that pharmaceutical firms will miss delivery targets in the coming months. And the commission, the EU's executive arm, wants to ensure that member states will receive all the shots that have been promised for the second quarter. These vaccines will be critical in order to reach its target of vaccinating 70% of the EU's adult population by the end of the summer.	LONDON — The European Commission presented new plans on Wednesday to restrict the export of Covid-19 vaccines from the 27-member bloc. Officials are concerned that pharmaceutical firms will miss delivery targets in the coming months. And the commission, the EU's executive arm, wants to ensure that member states will receive all the shots that have been promised for the second quarter. These vaccines will be critical in order to reach its target of vaccinating 70% of the EU's adult population by the end of the summer. "While our Member States are facing the third wave of the pandemic and not every company is delivering on its contract, the EU is the only major OECD producer that continues to export vaccines at large scale to dozens of countries. But open roads should run in both directions," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. The proposals build on the mechanisms already in place, and will introduce two changes where EU member states will look at "reciprocity" and "proportionality" with their exports. They will now consider whether the destination country restricts its own vaccine exports, or raw materials, and whether the destination country is ahead or behind the EU with its vaccine rollout. This tougher position from Brussels comes after it suffered setbacks in the number of vaccines delivered by AstraZeneca . Earlier this year, the Anglo-Swedish firm said it could only deliver 30 million doses of its vaccine, developed alongside Oxford University, in the first quarter instead of around 90 million doses. And, more recently, the pharma giant also cut delivery expectations for the second quarter to less than half of what the bloc was initially expecting. The AstraZeneca shot is important for the wider rollout in the European Union, because some countries favor it due to it being cheaper and requiring less stringent maintenance conditions, compared with others. A EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, said at a briefing Wednesday that the new proposal "is not an export ban." "There is a continued shortfall in the production of vaccines and there is also ... a not-fair-enough balance when it comes to distribution," the official said, adding that the idea is to overcome this gap and make vaccine supply more balanced. Von der Leyen already suggested last week that the EU should consider tougher vaccine controls. She claimed at the time that while the EU had exported 41 million doses of Covid-19 shots since January to 33 countries worldwide, some nations were not showing the same level of reciprocity. Data from the commission shows that from the exports so far, the U.K. has received the most, more than 10 million doses; followed by Canada, which has received 6.6 million; and then Japan with 5.4 million. The renewed stance in Brussels could become an issue for the U.K., which has been the biggest recipient of coronavirus shots produced in the EU so far, and where the vaccination rate is well ahead of the EU's. "It is not against the U.K., it is to ensure AstraZeneca complies with the commitments it takes vis-à-vis with the European Union," Arancha Gonzalez, minister of foreign affairs in Spain, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Wednesday. "The export restrictions we have prepared for were never meant to be against countries. They were meant to be to ensure that pharmaceutical companies would comply with their commitments, with the contracts they have made with the European Commission," she added. A spokesperson for the U.K. government said Wednesday: "We are all fighting the same pandemic — vaccines are an international collaboration by great scientists around the world. And we will continue to work with our European partners to deliver the vaccine rollout." The commission announced in late January that member states would be able to prevent shots from leaving the bloc when pharmaceutical firms were not complying with deliveries and when the vaccines were heading to countries not considered vulnerable by the EU. The new plans on Wednesday build on this legislation. But the old rules are expiring at the end of March. The latest proposal will be discussed by the 27 heads of state on Thursday during an EU summit. Earlier this week, Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin warned about a tougher vaccine export policy, saying it could undermine the supply of raw materials for vaccine production in the EU. "I am very much against it. I think it would be a very retrograde step," Martin told RTE radio.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has reversed plans for a lockdown over Easter amid criticism from experts and officials over the move. Experts said it would have little impact on a third wave of infections sweeping the country. Merkel said plans to place the country in a strict lockdown over the Easter holiday — which would have seen all shops and churches close from April 1-5 — were a "mistake."	German Chancellor Angela Merkel reversed plans on Wednesday for a coronavirus lockdown over Easter amid criticism from experts and officials over the move. The plans had called for placing the country in a strict lockdown over the Easter holiday — which would have seen all shops and churches close from April 1-5. "We must try to slow down the third wave of the pandemic. Nevertheless, it was a mistake," Merkel said during a press conference, according to German news outlet Deutsche Welle . "At the end of the day, I carry the last responsibility." "It's now important for me to say so here. A mistake should be called a mistake and above all, it should be corrected, preferably in good time," she added, according to the news agency. Merkel's comments come after sharp criticism that a plan, devised earlier this week with regional leaders, to impose a strict lockdown over the Easter period to help halt a third wave of coronavirus cases currently being seen in Germany, largely driven by more infectious variants of the virus. Critics of the move, which included health experts and business leaders, said the lockdown could cause more harm than good, particularly the plans to allow grocery stores and supermarkets to open for a limited amount of time over the holiday — a move likely to cause crowds to gather. Others questioned the lost working hours and wages the move would entail. "It was well reasoned, but was not really doable in such a short time," Merkel said Wednesday, reflecting on the original lockdown proposal. "Too many questions, from missing wages through to the loss of time in factories and facilities, could not be adequately answered in time." It's a rare U-turn from a leader considered Europe's figurehead and seen as a steady hand during times of crisis. It's also a further signal that Germany, a country lauded for its initial response to the pandemic, is starting to feel the strain of difficult decisions having to be made as the pandemic continues to throw up new challenges and concerns. When the pandemic emerged in Europe in early 2020, Germany showed it was able to quickly test, trace and isolate early cases of the virus, helping to stop its spread. Its modern health-care network also helped prevent as many deaths as were seen in its continental neighbors. Germany has recorded almost 2.7 million cases and over 75,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. This compares with the U.K.'s 4.3 million cases and over 126,000 deaths. The country had started to ease lockdown measures recently, allowing schools to reopen in February and some nonessential shops to admit customers again earlier this month. Like other European nations, it was banking on the rollout of coronavirus vaccines to enable it to slowly reopen its economy, the largest in Europe. Vaccination rollouts have not gone to plan in the EU, however, with Germany, a country known for its organizational skills, negatively surprising experts with its sluggish program. Germany is not alone in having to adjust plans around Easter; Italy is to reimpose a national lockdown over the period for the second-year running while Paris and other parts of France are again under a partial lockdown.
The U.K. has set out plans to create a new national health security agency to plan for, prevent and respond to "future external health threats, such as infectious diseases." The "UK Health Security Agency" is to lead protection against future health threats and "will ensure the nation can respond quickly and at greater scale to deal with pandemics and future threats," the government announced Wednesday.	LONDON — The U.K. has set out plans to create a new national health security agency to plan for, prevent and respond to "future external health threats, such as infectious diseases." The "UK Health Security Agency" is to lead protection against future health threats and "will ensure the nation can respond quickly and at greater scale to deal with pandemics and future threats," the government announced Wednesday. The agency will be led by Dr. Jenny Harries, an official who has become a familiar face to the British public during the coronavirus pandemic as England's deputy chief medical officer. Harries has frequently participated in televised briefings alongside government officials during the pandemic. The U.K. reflected on a tough year of coronavirus lockdowns and losses on Tuesday , a year after the first lockdown was imposed on March 23, 2020. Since then, over 4.3 million people have contracted the virus nationwide, with more than 125,000 deaths — making it one of the hardest-hit countries in the world. One bright spot has been the country's rapid vaccination rollout, which started in December. To date, over 28.3 million adults in the U.K. have had the first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Last Saturday, a record-breaking 844,285 vaccine doses were delivered on one day alone. Health officials point out there is no room for complacency despite the scheduled easing of further restrictions on public life. More infectious variants of the virus are spreading throughout the world and the U.K.'s continental neighbors on mainland Europe are also now experiencing a third wave of infections. As elsewhere, there is a consensus among U.K. officials that the country needs to be better prepared to deal with any future pandemics, and what it called "external" health threats. The U.K.'s Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he wants "everybody at UKHSA, at all levels, to wake up every day with a zeal to plan for the next pandemic."  Covid-19, he said, had "shown the challenges of protecting the nation's health are changing at an unprecedented pace, as new types of threats emerge." The government said the new body, which will come into force in April, replacing the National Institute for Health Protection, will be "the U.K. leader for health security, providing intellectual, scientific and operational leadership at national and local level, as well as on the global stage." The primary focus for the UKHSA in its initial phase will be the continued fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the government said. It will also continue to bring together agencies and expertise that have been deployed during the coronavirus crisis, such as the U.K.'s respected genomic surveillance capabilities, and its contact tracing network.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline stretching from Russia to Germany poses a security threat to Europe. The pipeline, which is approximately 95% completed, is a major sticking point for the Biden administration and crucial NATO ally, Germany. Berlin has resisted pressure from Washington to pull its support for the project.	WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Germany on Wednesday that companies building the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline could face sanctions, as Washington tries to pressure Berlin to pull its support for the controversial Russian-backed energy project. Blinken, during a press conference at NATO headquarters, said he made clear to German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas that President Joe Biden opposes the project, which would pipe gas directly from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, bypassing U.S. and EU ally Ukraine. The secretary said he wanted to make sure during his conversation with Maas that there was "no ambiguity" in the U.S. position on the pipeline. "The pipeline divides Europe, it exposes Ukraine and Central Europe to Russian manipulation and coercion and it goes against Europe's own stated energy security goals," Blinken said. "President Biden has been very clear for a long time in his view that Nord Stream 2 is a bad idea and I reiterated that view directly to [German] Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and I also made clear that firms engaged in pipeline construction risk U.S. sanctions," Blinken added. Read more: The Nord Stream 2 dilemma: Why a trans-Atlantic dispute is likely to go from very bad to even worse The U.S. is concerned the pipeline project will undermine Ukraine's security and economy, which relies on transporting gas, while making Western Europe more dependent on Russian energy. Berlin has resisted pressure from Washington to pull its support for the project. Last week, Blinken called on firms participating in Nord Stream 2 to quit the project or risk sanctions. "The Department reiterates its warning that any entity involved in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline risks U.S. sanctions and should immediately abandon work on the pipeline," the nation's top diplomat said. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on a Russian pipe-laying ship, but it has been unclear how hard a line the Biden administration will take. Russia's Gazprom owns Nord Stream 2 AG, the company tasked with the planning, construction and operation of the pipeline. The project has received financing from Germany's Uniper and Wintershall Dea, France's Engie, Austria's OMV and the Netherlands' Shell.
The Dutch capital of Amsterdam became the first city worldwide to formally implement doughnut economics in early April last year. Belgium's capital city of Brussels went on to adopt the doughnut in late September, while the Canadian city of Nanaimo voted to follow suit in December. Scholars advocating for a new approach argue that the current economic system sacrifices both people and environments at a time when everything from shifting weather patterns to rising sea levels is global in scope and unprecedented in nature.	LONDON — More and more cities are embracing a doughnut-shaped economic model to help recover from the coronavirus crisis and reduce exposure to future shocks. British economist and author of "Doughnut Economics" Kate Raworth believes it is simply a matter of time before the concept is adopted at a national level. The Dutch capital of Amsterdam became the first city worldwide to formally implement doughnut economics in early April last year , choosing to launch the initiative at a time when the country had one of the world's highest mortality rates from the coronavirus pandemic. Amsterdam's city government said at the time that it hoped to recover from the crisis and avoid future crises by embracing a city portrait of the doughnut theory. As outlined in Raworth's 2017 book, doughnut economics aims to "act as a compass for human progress," turning last century's degenerative economy into this century's regenerative one. "The compass is a doughnut, the kind with a hole in the middle. Ridiculous though that sounds, it is the only doughnut that actually turns out to be good for us," Raworth told CNBC via telephone. Its goal is to ensure nobody falls short of life's essentials, from food and water to social equity and political voice, while ensuring humanity does not break down Earth's life support systems, such as a stable climate and fertile soils. Using a simple diagram of a doughnut, Raworth suggests that the outer ring represents Earth's environmental ceiling — a place where the collective use of resources has an adverse impact on the planet. The inner ring represents a series of internationally agreed minimum social standards. The space in between, described as "humanity's sweet spot," is the doughnut. "We want to make sure everybody has the fundamental resources they need to lead a life with dignity, community and opportunity. Leave nobody in the hole in the middle," Raworth said. The model, which has previously been commended by Pope Francis , has received renewed attention amid the global health crisis. Scholars advocating for a new approach argue that the current economic system sacrifices both people and environments at a time when everything from shifting weather patterns to rising sea levels is global in scope and unprecedented in nature. The Doughnut Economics Action Lab, or DEAL, started working with Amsterdam policymakers to downscale the global concept of the doughnut into a city model in December 2019, Raworth said. The municipality then formally adopted the model on April 8, 2020. "We had some doubts at first regarding the timing," Marieke van Doorninck, deputy mayor of the City of Amsterdam, told CNBC. "But it turned out that people were also longing for ideas to rebuild our economy after the crisis. Our circular strategy is a tool to ensure we don't go back to 'business as usual' but look forward to a way to shape our economy differently." Within six weeks of Amsterdam's announcement, Raworth told CNBC that policymakers in Copenhagen, Denmark had started exploring the concept. Belgium's capital city of Brussels went on to adopt the doughnut in late September, while the Canadian city of Nanaimo voted to follow suit in December. Raworth said many more towns and cities worldwide are in contact with DEAL every week, and work continues with partners in Costa Rica, India, Bangladesh, Zambia and Barbados, among others. "The city of Amsterdam has always been a pioneering city. It loves to be a pioneer which is a brilliant attribute because there are many cities that will not lead. They will only follow when they see someone else go," Raworth said. "It is not going to work to have three, four, five separate strategies all trying to connect. When they encountered the concept of the doughnut, I know that they said: 'Aha, this is a concept that sits above and embraces everything that it is that we want to do.'" Van Doorninck, who's responsible for spatial development and sustainability in the Dutch capital, said the city's circular strategy was focused on areas where local government "can really make a difference." These areas include food and organic waste streams, consumer goods and the built environment. As a result, the city has targeted a 50% reduction in food waste by 2030, implemented measures to make it easier for residents to consume less (by establishing easily accessible and well-functioning second-hand shops and repair services over the next three years) and pushed for construction companies to build with sustainable materials. "We are very proud to be an example for other cities and we (are) happy to spread the message," van Doorninck said. "Nothing succeeds like success. It would be very good news for so many people if a successful doughnut in Amsterdam means that other cities, countries and institutions will start using the theory." Around five months after Amsterdam bet its post-Covid recovery on the doughnut, the Brussels region formally embraced the model, using it as a portrait for the city's transition to a sustainable and thriving economy. Barbara Trachte, secretary of state for the Brussels region, told CNBC that an important feature of the Brussels doughnut was its "deeply participatory dynamic." Trachte, who is responsible for economic transition and scientific research for the Brussels region, said the model embodied a "paradigm shift" and helped to shape the region's efforts to look at economics differently. "I think people understand the power of the doughnut theory, to rethink the old economic mantras," she said. "It gives them a positive boost, a sort of 'let's do it' attitude, that can move mountains. And if the Brussels Region can help show the way, all the better." Raworth said there was something about the dynamism, scale and energy of a city that might help to explain why these areas are more open to experimenting with new ideas. There's also, certainly in the U.K. at least, a sense of local civic pride that means people tend to be prouder to say the city they are part of, rather than the nation in which they reside, she said. "There's also something about the visibility of a city. You can see what happens when the city policymakers paint yellow lines on the street and move car lanes to bike lanes. You can see how that changes," she added. When asked whether she believed the doughnut model would soon be adopted at a national level, Raworth replied: "Yes, I do." "Everything that's happening is because people in a place have seen it and said: 'We think that could be useful for us.' So, it's all drawn by local changemakers," she continued. "We go where the energy is and it is getting picked up. We know the power of peer inspiration so when Amsterdam launches, it triggers this interest in many places."
At the heart of the recent dispute is the fact that the EU has received significantly fewer vaccines than expected from AstraZeneca, which is putting its wider rollout at risk. So far, only 17 million doses of this vaccine have been distributed to EU countries, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. AstraZeneca said 10 million doses will be sent to EU nations in the last week of March, bringing it closed to the 30 million target for the first quarter.	LONDON — The U.K. and European Union are trying to resolve a dispute over Covid-19 vaccine supplies, shortly after EU officials announced stricter rules on exports of shots produced in the bloc. The U.K. and the EU have been at odds in recent weeks with the latter complaining that London is not showing the same level of reciprocity in the distribution of vaccines. The EU has said that since the end of January more than 10 million doses produced in the EU have gone to the U.K., but the U.K. had exported none in return. "We are all facing the same pandemic and the third wave makes cooperation between the EU and UK even more important. We have been discussing what more we can do to ensure a reciprocally beneficial relationship between the UK and EU on Covid-19," the U.K. government and the European Commission said in a joint statement on Wednesday. "Given our interdependencies, we are working on specific steps we can take - in the short-, medium - and long term - to create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all our citizens," the U.K. and EU said, adding that talks would continue. At the heart of the recent dispute is the fact that the EU has received significantly fewer vaccines than expected from AstraZeneca , which is putting its wider rollout at risk. The Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical firm was due to distribute around 90 million doses in the first quarter, but that number has since been cut to 30 million doses. AstraZeneca, which developed its Covid vaccine in collaboration with the University of Oxford, has said yield issues in EU plants have hindered production. So far, only 17 million doses have been distributed to EU countries, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. EU leaders will hold a virtual summit on Thursday to discuss ways to bolster Covid vaccine supplies and how to improve the rollout of doses. EU countries faced a new setback after AstraZeneca reduced its delivery target for the second quarter to 70 million doses, down from 180 million. "I remind you that AstraZeneca has only delivered a small portion of its agreed contractual commitments," Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU's trade chief, said at a press conference on Wednesday. As a result, the European Commission decided to step up rules on the exports of vaccines produced in the bloc. The executive arm of the EU said on Wednesday that in addition to checking whether companies are fulfilling their contracts, it will also take into consideration whether the country receiving EU-made vaccines has a higher vaccination rate and better epidemiological situation as a whole and whether the recipient nation has any restrictions on sending vaccines or raw materials elsewhere. This is why the U.K. could expect to see a lower number of imported Covid shots going forward. It has a higher vaccination rate than the EU and, according to the EU commission, is not sharing its vaccines with other nations. "Our export authorization mechanism is not addressed at any specific country, but it's clear that in the EU, we also need to ensure vaccination of our own population," Dombrovskis said. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that blocking vaccines was not "sensible." At the weekend, Italian authorities discovered 29 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines at a finishing plant close to Rome. AstraZeneca said in a statement that these shots were waiting for quality control and that 13 million were due to be dispatched to low- and middle-income nations and the remaining 16 million doses were due to be sent to EU nations, with 10 million expected to be sent in the last week of March. "It is incorrect to describe this as a stockpile. The process of manufacturing vaccines is very complex and time consuming. In particular, vaccine doses must wait for quality control clearance after the filling of vials is completed," AstraZeneca said in a statement.
Heralded as "the vaccine for the world," AstraZeneca's Covid shot has always been accompanied by high hopes since its development at breakneck speed in 2020. But unlike other coronavirus vaccine developers, the shot developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford has been been particularly plagued with issue after issue since its inception.	Heralded as "the vaccine for the world," AstraZeneca's Covid shot has been accompanied by high hopes ever since its inception. But unlike other coronavirus vaccines, the shot developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford has been plagued by problem after problem. AstraZeneca's troubles started almost as soon as it published interim trial data and have continued ever since. The drugmaker "seems to have a real PR problem on its hands in the U.S. and in Europe," Sunaina Sinha Haldea, managing partner of Cebile Capital, told CNBC on Thursday, warning that its "public relations problem risks undermining confidence in the vaccine outside of the U.K." Here's a timeline of all the problems that have struck AstraZeneca in the past year: AstraZeneca published an interim analysis of clinical trials showing that its Covid vaccine had an average efficacy of 70% in protecting against the virus. The result was initially cheered by the global community, already buoyed by positive results for Moderna's and Pfizer-BioNTech's shots. After further scrutiny, it became clear that the 70% figure came from combining the analyses of two separate dosing regimens within the trials. One dosing regimen showed an effectiveness of 90% when trial participants received a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart. The other showed 62% efficacy when two full doses were given at least one month apart. AstraZeneca admitted the half-dose regime was an error but described it as "useful mistake" and "serendipity." It attracted criticism from U.S. experts, however, and AstraZeneca's haphazard communication surrounding the mistake arguably marked the start of its reputational issues. In early January, the U.K. started to roll out the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine . It had an added bonus for the country: the majority of its doses would be made in Britain. However, it wasn't long before an argument over supplies started brewing with the European Union, following reports that the drugmaker was not going to fulfil its contracted deliveries to the bloc. A very public dispute over contracts ensued , starting a saga of acrimonious relations between the EU and both the U.K. and the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker. The EU made waves suggesting that AstraZeneca divert supplies to the bloc from the U.K. As the dispute over supplies was brewing, some European nations started to cast doubt over the AstraZeneca vaccine's efficacy in the over-65 age group— arguably those most in need of the shot due to age-related Covid risks. Germany's vaccine committee recommended that the AstraZeneca vaccine should be offered only to people ages 18-64, saying there was not enough trial data to assess the efficacy in people over 65. Several German newspapers reported that the vaccine had an efficacy rate of less than 10% in the over-65 cohort — described as "completely incorrect" by AstraZeneca. France's President Emmanuel Macron poured oil on the fire, saying the vaccine seemed "quasi-ineffective" for those over 65 . Later trial data involving older participants showed that the vaccine was safe and effective for the group, and saved lives, but by then the reputational damage was done — particularly in France where vaccine hesitancy is already rife . At the end of January, the EU's drugs regulator approved the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for all adults . France, Germany and other countries then revised their stances, approving the vaccine for the over-65 group (with some caveats in France). The problems for AstraZeneca got even worse in March, despite real-world data from the U.K. showing that the shot, alongside Pfizer's, was having indubitably positive effects with coronavirus cases — hospitalizations and deaths all falling . Meanwhile, the EU's infection rate was rising as the bloc's vaccine rollout remained sluggish. Then there were reports of blood clots in some people who had been vaccinated with the AstraZeneca shot, and more than a dozen European countries suspended its use pending a safety review. AstraZeneca defended its vaccine, saying the number of blood clots recorded post-vaccination were lower than could be expected to occur naturally . The World Health Organization and European Medicines Agency conducted safety reviews into the vaccine and concluded it was safe and effective and that its benefits outweighed the risks. By then, however, further damage to the AstraZeneca shot's reputation had been done . The woes for AstraZeneca have continued this week — despite it starting on a high note for the drugmaker. On Monday, the findings of a large U.S. trial showed that its vaccine was safe and highly effective, spurring hopes that it could soon seek U.S. clearance for the shot. However, on Tuesday, a U.S. health agency said AstraZeneca may have included "outdated" information in the trial results , casting doubt over published efficacy rates. AstraZeneca responded that the figures published Monday "were based on a pre-specified interim analysis with a data cut-off of 17 February" and said it would share its primary analysis with the most up-to-date efficacy data within 48 hours. On Wednesday, it issued updated phase three trial data for its Covid-19 vaccine that showed its vaccine to be 76% effective — slightly lower than the 79% rate published on Monday. The issues facing AstraZeneca could be set to continue, as EU leaders meet virtually on Thursday to discuss possible vaccine export bans that could hit the drugmaker. The EU and U.K. said Wednesday, however, that they wanted to find a "win-win" solution to the supply issue. The negative coverage of AstraZeneca has led some onlookers (and certainly, the British media) to suggest that the vaccine has become a target for negative sentiment in Europe directed at the U.K. after Brexit. It has also been suggested that the shot could be the victim of vaccine nationalism in the U.S., where rival shots from Moderna and Pfizer - BioNTech originate (although BioNTech is a German company). Whatever the underlying causes, AstraZeneca's reputation has been sorely damaged. As health-care analysts at Shore Capital said in a note Thursday: "Any confusion about results can be quickly amplified into concerns about the safety and efficacy of vaccines even when those concerns are not based on solid evidence." The AstraZeneca vaccine, they noted, "has been particularly hard hit by confusion around the data reported. Importantly, such confusion can lead to an erosion of trust in vaccines which are proven, life-saving medicines."
Germany was initially widely praised for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. A year on, and the situation is very different. Europe's biggest economy is now confronting a third wave of infections, a rising death toll and accusations of mismanagement aimed at the government.	LONDON — A third wave of the coronavirus pandemic has heaped more political problems onto Chancellor Angela Merkel and her ruling CDU party as the country edges closer to federal elections later this year. Germany was initially widely praised for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, dealing deftly with the initial outbreak in the country by isolating cases and tracing contacts while its modern and well-equipped hospitals helped to keep fatalities low. A year on, and the situation is very different, with Europe's biggest economy confronting a third wave of infections, a rising death toll and accusations of health crisis mismanagement aimed at the government. On Wednesday, Merkel made waves by reversing a plan to lockdown the country over the Easter break saying she had made a "mistake." This came after criticism from health experts and business leaders, who said the proposal could cause more harm than good. The concession comes as experts reflect on Germany's handling of the pandemic, and look at how the ruling Christian Democratic Union-Christian Social Union parties could be affected when Germans cast their votes in a federal election in September. Merkel's CDU party has already fared poorly in recent state elections , signaling that it could be punished again later in the year by voters erring toward the center-left Social Democrats and particularly, the environmentalist Greens, whose support has risen markedly. "Mismanagement hurts," Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, commented in a note Thursday. "Last March, a deft response to the pandemic sent support for Chancellor Angela Merkel and her CDU/CSU almost into the stratosphere." But he added that while Germany handled the first wave of the pandemic better than most other developed countries, "this is no longer the case." "Confusing policy shifts and slow vaccination progress have now undermined public confidence in the ability of the CDU/CSU, which has led the government for most of post-war history including the past 15 years, to steer Germany through the crisis," he noted. Schmieding noted that a kickback scandal involving CDU-CSU members of Parliament had resonated with the public, with polls showing a fall in support for the CDU-CSU back to pre-pandemic levels. "Merkel's U-turn away from an 'Easter shutdown' may add to the woes ," he added. A drop in popularity for the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, comes as question marks remain over who will be at the helm of Germany's government come September when Merkel's final term in office comes to an end. The CDU-CSU have not yet said which candidate it will put forward for the election. Merkel's U-turn on Wednesday was unusual given that she has long been considered a steady hand during times of crisis. The move showed that the German government is also feeling the pressure of having to make difficult decisions amid a fast-moving pandemic situation. Following the U-turn on Wednesday, Merkel rejected demands by the opposition to ask Parliament for a vote of confidence in her government. Germany has now recorded over 2.7 million cases and 75,498 deaths, to date, according to Johns Hopkins University data, far lower than the U.K.'s This compares with the U.K.'s 4.3 million cases and over 126,621 deaths. The country had started to ease lockdown measures recently, allowing schools to reopen in February and some nonessential shops to admit customers again earlier this month. Like other European nations, it was banking on the rollout of coronavirus vaccines to enable it to slowly reopen its economy, the largest in Europe. Germany is not alone in having to adjust its plans; Italy is to reimpose a national lockdown over the Easter period for the second-year running while Paris and other parts of France are again under a partial lockdown. Public tolerance of renewed lockdowns might be higher were vaccine rollouts going to plan in the EU. But, as a whole, immunization programs across the bloc reveal a checkered rate of vaccinations. EU leaders met virtually on Thursday to discuss whether to block vaccine exports from the EU, as other countries like the U.K race ahead with their programs. Earlier on Thursday, Merkel defended the EU's strategy to procure vaccines as a bloc, rather than individually. "Now that we see even small differences in the distribution of vaccines cause big discussions, I would not like to imagine if some member states had vaccines and others did not. That would shake the internal market to its core," she told German lawmakers ahead of the EU summit, Reuters reported. She also suggested the region's vaccination issues were more to do with lower production capacity rather than under-ordering shots. "British production sites are manufacturing for Britain and the United States is not exporting, so we are reliant on what we can make in Europe," she said. "We have to assume that the virus, with its mutations, may be occupying us for a long time to come so the question goes far beyond this year," she added.
The EU has exported more shots than it has given to its citizens so far. However, some EU nations have voiced concerns about the stricter export rules, with countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands wanting supply chains to remain open. European Commission President said that AstraZeneca, "has to catch up, has to honor the contract it has with the European member states, before it can engage again in exporting vaccines."	LONDON — The European Union has stepped up tough rules on the exports of Covid vaccines, while also piling pressure on AstraZeneca to deliver more shots to the region. It comes as the region's sluggish vaccine rollout faces scrutiny, despite the EU continuing to export millions of coronavirus shots abroad. In an attempt to have a stronger negotiating position with pharmaceutical firms that do not respect delivery targets, the bloc has extended its strict rules on vaccine exports. Before approving shipments of Covid-19 shots, the EU will consider whether the recipient country has any restrictions on vaccines or raw materials, as well as if it is in a better epidemiological situation. "We want to make sure that Europe gets its fair share of vaccines. Because we must be able to explain to our citizens that if companies export their vaccines to the whole world, it is because they are fully honoring their commitments and it does not risk security of supply in the European Union," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday. Data released on Thursday showed that the EU has exported 77 million doses of Covid shots since December to 33 countries worldwide. At the same time, 88 million have been delivered to EU countries, of which 62 million have been administered. As such, the EU has exported more shots than it has given to its citizens so far. However, some EU nations have voiced concerns about the stricter export rules, with countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands wanting supply chains to remain open. There is a risk that if exports of vaccines are stopped, it could start a trade war and other parts of the world — which make the raw materials needed for vaccine production — might stop shipping them to Europe. The EU has also been at odds with the Swedish-British drugmaker for not delivering as many Covid shots as the bloc was expecting. The 27 nations were awaiting 90 million doses of this vaccine in the first quarter and 180 million in the second quarter of 2021. However, AstraZeneca has said that production issues mean it can only deliver 30 million doses until the end of March and 70 million between April and June. The reduced delivery targets are a concern for EU nations, some of whom wanted more of this vaccine as it's cheaper and easier to store than others. Any further delivery delays to Europe could compromise its wider rollout plans. "We all know, we could have been much faster if all pharmaceutical companies had fulfilled their contracts," von der Leyen said on Thursday. During a press conference, she added that AstraZeneca, "has to catch up, has to honor the contract it has with the European member states, before it can engage again in exporting vaccines." The EU's vaccine rollout has faced a number of challenges since the beginning and the Commission, which negotiated with the drugmakers, has been criticized for taking too long to sign vaccine deals. Speaking to CNBC on Friday, Italy's former prime minister Mario Monti said: "We should not be too surprised that Europe has reacted quite well in terms of monetary, financial fiscal response to the pandemic, and so far not quite (as) well in terms of procurement and industrial response." He argued that while EU nations have integrated their monetary policies and part of their fiscal responses, "there has never been such a thing as a health union." The individual governments are still in charge of their own health policies, whereas areas like international trade are the main responsibility of the European Commission. The EU's tighter export rules could become an issue for the U.K. in particular, which has been receiving vaccines from the EU. Its vaccination rate is higher than the bloc's, when looking at the number of first doses given. Numbers from the European Commission show that the U.K. has received 21 million doses of vaccines produced in the bloc — the highest share of EU exports so far. The U.K. has administered 31 million doses of Covid-19 shots to its population so far, which suggests that about two-thirds of the vaccines used in the U.K. have come from the EU. "We have been discussing what more we can do to ensure a reciprocally beneficial relationship between the U.K. and EU on Covid-19," the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday. "Given our interdependencies, we are working on specific steps we can take - in the short-, medium - and long term - to create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all our citizens." Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said at a press conference on Thursday that a vaccine supply agreement between the EU and the U.K. could be announced as early as Saturday.
Britain's finance ministry said the two sides have agreed terms on a "Memorandum of Understanding" that will set the conditions for how regulators from the EU and Britain share information. However, Brussels has said the MoU will not automatically lead to Britain's large financial industry being able to sell a wide range of products and services to EU clients again.	Britain and the European Union agreed a new post-Brexit financial services pact on Friday that will allow them to co-operate on regulation but does little to improve the City of London's access to the bloc. Britain's finance ministry said the two sides have agreed terms on a "Memorandum of Understanding" that will set the conditions for how regulators from the EU and Britain share information. However, Brussels has said the MoU will not automatically lead to Britain's large financial industry being able to sell a wide range of products and services to EU clients again. Industry experts said while the framework was useful, it was unlikely to rekindle anything like the kind of access banks and brokers had to the EU before Britain left the bloc. Brexit has already put a dent in Britain's financial industry and a City of London official has described the framework as a "talking shop". "This is unlikely to offer solid foundations for bulk cross border business," said Simon Morris, a financial services partner at law firm CMS. In January, more than 6 billion euros in daily share trading left London for Amsterdam, along with swathes of trading in derivatives. In a further potential blow to Britain's financial services might, Brussels is now considering forcing the clearing of euro swaps, still dominated by the London Stock Exchange's LCH arm in London, to move to the bloc. Friday's MoU agreement is similar to what the EU already has with the United States for arranging regular, informal and non-binding meetings of financial regulators to discuss new rules and air any disagreements. So far, the EU has declined to grant any long-term direct access for financial firms from Britain, saying this week that it was in no rush. "Overall, for investors in UK financial services, a greater degree of cooperation between Europe and the UK can only be seen in a favourable light," said Alan Custis, head of UK equities at Lazard Asset Management. "But it still feels as though the UK needs to continue to plough its own furrow in case there is a change of heart." Jonathan Hill, a former EU financial services commissioner, said this week that Britain should not sit around for access, known as equivalence, but focus on making the City more attractive to international investors. "Achieving a form of equivalence with the EU is essential but it should not detract us from the real challenge: making London and other financial capitals in Europe more competitive relative to the fast growing US and Asian markets," said Daniel Pinto, chief executive of Stanhope Capital.
Chinese officials on Monday said Sweden's H&M and other foreign companies should not to make rash moves or step into politics after the companies raised concerns about forced labor in Xinjiang, sparking furious online backlash and boycotts. H&M, Burberry, Nike and Adidas and other Western brands have been hit by consumer boycotts in China since last week over comments about their sourcing of cotton in Xinjiang. Chinese social media users last week began circulating a 2020 statement by H&M announcing it would no longer source cotton from Xinjiang.	Chinese officials on Monday said Sweden's H&M and other foreign companies should not to make rash moves or step into politics after the companies raised concerns about forced labor in Xinjiang, sparking furious online backlash and boycotts . H&M, Burberry,  Nike and Adidas and other Western brands have been hit by consumer boycotts in China since last week over comments about their sourcing of cotton in Xinjiang. The growing rift comes as the United States and other Western governments increase pressure on China over suspected human-rights abuses in the western region. "I don't think a company should politicize its economic behavior," said Xu Guixiang, a Xinjiang government spokesman at a news conference on Monday morning. "Can H&M continue to make money in the Chinese market? Not any more." "To rush into this decision and get involved in the sanctions is not reasonable. It's like lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet," he said. Chinese social media users last week began circulating a 2020 statement by H&M announcing it would no longer source cotton from Xinjiang. H&M said at the time the decision was due to difficulties conducting credible due diligence in the region and after media and human rights' groups reported the use of forced labor in Xinjiang — a charge that Beijing has repeatedly denied. Elijan Anayat, another Xinjiang government spokesman, said during the briefing that Chinese people do not want the products of companies such as H&M and Nike that have boycotted Xinjiang's cotton. He said he welcomed companies to take trips to the region's cotton fields to see for themselves what is happening. Washington on Friday condemned what it called a "state-led" social media campaign in China against U.S. and other international companies for committing not to use cotton from Xinjiang. The wave of consumer boycotts in China has coincided with a coordinated set of sanctions imposed by Britain, Canada, the European Union and the United States last week over what they say are human rights abuses taking place in Xinjiang. The U.S. government has publicly accused Beijing of genocide against the Uyghur Muslim ethnic minorities in the region. Xu repeatedly rejected accusations of genocide and human rights abuses in the region and accused the Western powers of engaging in political manipulation to destabilize China with the sanctions. "They have lost their minds and their conscience, they are enthusiastic about political manipulation and the abuse of sanctions, to a level that is hysterical," said Xu. "Their real purpose by fabricating the issue of genocide is to disrupt security and stability in China," Anayat said. The United States in January announced an import ban on all cotton and tomato products from the area due to allegations of forced labor from detained Uyghur Muslims. Western governments and rights groups have previously accused authorities in the far-western region of detaining and torturing Uyghurs in camps, where some former inmates have said they were subject to ideological indoctrination. China has repeatedly denied all such charges and say the camps are for vocational training and combating religious extremism.
The public health situation is deteriorating further in France and Germany, while the U.K. is easing lockdown on Monday. Doctors in Germany and France have warned that their respective healthcare systems are under increasing pressure. The U.K. is allowing up to 6 people to meet outdoors from Monday, with outdoor sports also allowed to resume.	LONDON — Europe's Covid crisis looks to be diverging further this week as the public health situation deteriorates in France and Germany, but the U.K. takes another step in the easing of its lockdown on Monday. Germany has already extended its lockdown until April 18, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called on German states to do more to curb infections, and suggested that the federal government could wrest some control from the regions (which have been largely free to decide their own measures) to better contain the crisis. This comes despite Merkel performing a U-turn over plans to implement a strict Easter lockdown. "We have to break this third wave," Merkel told broadcaster ARD on Sunday. "We are obliged by law to contain the spread, and at the moment, that's not happening." She added that additional restrictions, such as curfews, could be needed to prevent "exponential growth" of the virus, Deutsche Welle reported . Germany reported 9,872 new cases on Monday, data from the Robert Koch Institute showed , bringing its total tally of infections to over 2.7 million. Almost 76,000 people have died from the virus, to date. On Saturday, intensive care doctors in the country called for a two-week hard lockdown in order to avoid overwhelming the health care system, and similar calls were made in France on Sunday, where cases continue to surge to worrying levels. The French government has already placed more than a dozen regions, including Paris, under a partial lockdown, but cases are rising and hospitals are struggling. On Sunday, critical care doctors in Paris warned in Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper that soaring infections could soon overwhelm the capital's hospitals and could force them to choose which patients they have the resources to treat. France reported 37,014 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, health ministry data showed , bringing its total number of infections to over 4.5 million. Over 94,000 people have died from the virus in the country, to date. Strategists at Deutsche Bank noted Monday that " investors are becoming increasingly worried at the rising number of cases in multiple regions, which in turn is raising the prospect of further restrictions and limits on economic activity." While mainland Europe struggles with a rise in cases, the U.K is easing lockdown measures further from today, following its roadmap to lift all restrictions on social contact on June 21. Dubbed "Happy Monday" in the British media, Brits can now gather in groups of up to six people outdoors and team sports can begin again. The "stay at home" rule has also come to an end, but the government is advising caution and says people should continue to work from home if possible. Travel abroad remains prohibited unless for essential reasons and a £5,000 ($6,887) fine has been introduced for anyone attempting to holiday abroad. The government plans to announce later this week — earlier than planned — how it expects international travel to resume. On April 12, non-essential shops, hairdressers, beauty salons and outdoor drinking and dining at pubs and restaurants will be allowed, giving Brits much-needed relief after a year of lockdowns and coronavirus losses. The country has reported over 4.3 million coronavirus cases and over 126,000 deaths. One bright spot in the country's pandemic experience has been its vaccination rollout that began in earnest in December, making it the first country to rollout coronavirus vaccines en masse. To date, 57% of the nation's adults having had a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine , meaning that 30 million adults have now had a first shot. The U.K.'s bold immunization program has been lauded for its speed and agility but has attracted criticism on the continent, where the rollout of shots has been more sluggish. Drugmaker AstraZeneca has been in the line of fire for delaying vaccine supplies to the bloc. So far, the EU has stopped short of preventing vaccine exports to the U.K., however, and both sides have pledged to work together to resolve a dispute over vaccine supplies.
The European Union could open up a "Pandora's box" if it restricts exports of Covid vaccines, said James Crabtree of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. He said the EU is facing "enormous political pressure" to begin to experiment with vaccine nationalism. The bloc has already imposed strict rules on exports, including checks on how controlled the receiving country's virus situation is compared to Europe's.	The European Union could open up a "Pandora's box" if it decides to restrict exports of coronavirus vaccines, a political analyst told CNBC last week. Vaccination drives in the 27-member bloc have been hindered by production issues. Anglo-Swedish firm AstraZeneca earlier this year cut its first-quarter target from 90 million doses to 30 million doses. The shot, developed in partnership with the University of Oxford, is favored for the vaccine rollout in the European Union. Officials have already imposed strict rules for exports . The EU will check if the receiving country has the virus under better control than Europe and whether it has limitations on vaccines or raw materials before allowing the shots to be shipped. Some EU nations, however, have concerns about the new rules and want supply chains to remain open. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is "really struggling" because other rich countries are doing much better on vaccinations compared to the EU, said James Crabtree, an associate professor in practice at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. "There's enormous political pressure … to begin to experiment with a kind of vaccine nationalism," Crabtree told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Friday. "This is, of course, very dangerous because the EU is normally one of the most responsible international actors," he said. He also warned that other countries may follow the EU's lead in prioritizing vaccines for domestic populations. "If it begins to try and restrict the flow of vaccines out of EU factories, then it opens up a Pandora's box in which countries like India may then begin to do the same," said Crabtree. That could be very damaging given that new Covid variants are likely to keep emerging, he added. For its part, the EU's trade chief, Valdis Dombrovskis, said it is "highly unfair" to accuse the EU of vaccine nationalism, given that it is "one of the largest vaccine exporters." Data shows that the EU has exported 77 million doses of the shots to 33 countries since December, while 88 million have been delivered to EU countries. The bloc has also complained that London is not showing the same level of reciprocity in the distribution of vaccines. Heather Conley of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) noted that the U.K. and EU said they are working toward a "reciprocally beneficial relationship." Still, leaders in Europe are nervous about their political futures with some countries going to the polls in the coming year or so, said Conley, who is director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at CSIS. "Political testiness of leaders and this hysteria about political futures will make the EU take steps that may work ultimately against their long-term interest of getting those vaccines into arms very quickly," she told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Friday. "I think the international harm that that would do to global vaccine production would be greater than the increased number of vaccines in the EU," she said. Experts have long warned that vaccine nationalism could be bad for public health and the economy. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in January said the coronavirus will continue to mutate and thrive if the distribution of vaccines remains inequitable. "Vaccine nationalism hurts us all and is self-defeating," Tedros said. "But on the flip side, vaccinating equitably saves lives, stabilizes health systems and would lead to a truly global economic recovery that stimulates job creation." — CNBC's Silvia Amaro, Chloe Taylor and Noah Higgins-Dunn contributed to this report.
A group in Germany, called the Citizens' Will Alliance, complained to the country's constitutional court that the European treaties do not allow the bloc to take on debt jointly. As a result, the German court on Friday stopped a law that would have paved the way for the European Commission to raise the funds. The German judges said they had to first rule on a motion for an interim injunction on the law. Countries severely hit by the pandemic, such as Italy and Spain, are desperately waiting for the fresh cash so they can rebuild their economies faster.	 LONDON — The European Union's much-needed coronavirus stimulus plan has hit a stumbling block after the German constitutional court raised questions about how the new debt is being taken on. The EU's 27 nations agreed in July to tap financial markets via the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, and raise 750 billion euros ($883 billion) to tackle the economic crisis sparked by the coronavirus. It was described at the time as a "Hamiltonian moment" for the bloc, in reference to the deal struck by U.S. Founding Father Alexander Hamilton to convert previous debts into joint obligations of the federal union. Though EU countries share many political decisions, each nation has full control over its fiscal arrangements. Agreeing to take on new debt proved controversial for more fiscally-conservative nations, who worry their taxpayers might face a higher bill as a result. This was the case in the Netherlands, for example, but Prime Minister Mark Rutte stressed at the time the unique nature of the deal: it is meant to be a one-off event to deal with an unprecedented and severe economic shock across the region. But this argument has not convinced every EU-sceptic. A group in Germany, called the Citizens' Will Alliance, complained to the country's constitutional court that the European treaties do not allow the bloc to take on debt jointly. As a result, the German court on Friday stopped a law that would have paved the way for the European Commission to raise the funds. The German judges said they had to first rule on a motion for an interim injunction on the law. "We are aware that the Recovery Fund is a political project already decided upon. However, given the considerable risks involved, the federal government should ensure that borrowing at the EU level and a circumvention of the fiscal rules does not become a permanent solution," the German constitutional court said on Friday. It comes despite 478 out of 645 German lawmakers giving the ratification of the law the greenlight last week. The European Commission cannot tap financial markets for the funds before all the member states have legislated in favour of the move. As many as 22 of the 27 EU nations have done so or are due to conclude the process next month. Austria, Poland, Hungary and the Netherlands have not yet confirmed when they will vote, and Germany is now under a cloud of uncertainty. "Unless the issue is resolved fast and in favour of the law which both houses of the German parliament had approved with broad majorities beforehand, pay-outs from the fund could thus be delayed or even be at risk," Holger Schmieding, chief European economist at Berenberg said in a note on Monday. The European Commission wants to start raising funds this summer and make them available to member states in the second half of 2021 — a year after the initial agreement. Countries severely hit by the pandemic, such as Italy and Spain, are desperately waiting for the fresh cash so they can rebuild their economies faster. And the recovery funds have become even more important as nations across Europe battle against a third wave of infections and impose stricter lockdowns. "Although the German Court case could generate some noise, we consider it unlikely that it will ultimately thwart the EU's common fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic," Schmieding said. He believes that a delay in pay-outs "would be unfortunate," but as long as markets expect the money to come through at some point, borrowing rates for EU nations should remain low. There is another issue at play, however. This is not the first time that the German constitutional court has raised questions about what it perceives as risky EU integration. In May of last year, the same court ruled that parts of the European Central Bank's government bond purchasing program were illegal under German law. "The risk of a bigger battle looms because Friday's motion reflects a bigger institutional problem for Germany and for Europe," Erik Nielsen, chief economist at UniCredit, said in a note on Sunday. He said the constitutional court could chose "a big fight with Germany's other branches of the state" or with the ECB once again, this time over its Covid stimulus program. 
Berlin's top health official, Dilek Kalayci, said Tuesday that the decision was taken as a precaution. The country's medical regulator announced 31 cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the vaccine. Nine of the people died.	The German state of Berlin is again suspending the use of AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine for people under 60 due to reports of blood clots. Berlin's top health official, Dilek Kalayci, said Tuesday that the decision was taken as a precaution ahead of a meeting of representatives from all of Germany's 16 states after the country's medical regulator announced 31 cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the vaccine. Nine of the people died. All but two of the cases involved women aged 20 to 63, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, Germany's medical regulator, said. Reports of an unusual form of blood clot in the head, known as sinus vein thrombosis, prompted several European countries to temporarily halt the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine earlier this month. After a review by medical experts, the European Medicines Agency concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks but recommended that warnings about possible rare side effects should be provided to patients and doctors. Most European Union countries have since resumed use of the vaccine. Earlier Tuesday, two state-owned hospitals in Berlin announced that they had stopped giving AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine to female staff members under 55-years-old. The heads of five university hospitals in western Germany called for a temporary halt to the vaccine for all younger women, citing the blood clot risk. Some 2.7 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been administered in Germany so far.
Global leaders jointly called for a pandemic treaty early Tuesday, arguing that the Covid-19 crisis had posed the "greatest challenge for the global community since the late 1940s." The joint letter, published in newspapers around the world, included the signatories of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The U.S. and China, as well as Russia, were notably absent from the signatories of the letter, however.	Global leaders have published a letter calling for a pandemic treaty to improve cooperation and transparency in the case of future outbreaks, but China and the U.S. were not among the signatories. In the joint letter, published Tuesday in newspapers around the world, the leaders argued that the Covid-19 crisis had posed the "greatest challenge for the global community since the late 1940s." The document was signed by more than 20 global leaders and officials from across Europe, Africa, South Africa and Asia, including U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. However, both China and the U.S. — which have locked horns numerous times during the pandemic, with accusations of a lack of transparency , propaganda and misinformation — were missing from the list. When questioned about the absence of China and the U.S. from the letter, the World Health Organization's Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (one of the signatories and main champions of a treaty) played down concerns. "I don't want it to be seen as a problem, it wasn't even a problem," he said during a press briefing Tuesday morning. "When the discussion on the global pandemic treaty starts, all member states will be represented." "Mainly it's like an opt-in (process). Countries who were interested were flagging to join, but in some instances were also inviting regional representation," he added. The WHO's director general said discussions with member states, including the U.S. and China, had been "positive," but did not confirm whether the U.S. and China (as well as Russia, another notable absentee) had been asked directly if they wanted to sign the letter. Within the letter, global leaders expressed the hope "that we can build a more robust international health architecture that provides better protection for future generations." "There will also be pandemics and other serious health crises in the future. No national government or multilateral organization can face such a threat alone. It is only a matter of time when the time comes again." The WHO's director general as well as European Council President Charles Michel, one of the first officials to call for an international agreement aimed at tackling future pandemics , also signed the letter. The press briefing on Tuesday morning comes ahead of the WHO's expected presentation of its joint investigation with China into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is largely expected to reiterate initial findings presented last month. In February, the WHO-China team of experts reported that the coronavirus "most likely" originated in animals before spreading to humans and dismissed a theory that the disease had been leaked by a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan. There were unanswered questions over whether the team had been able to fully investigate the matter, however, given delays in the investigation (the team of experts led by WHO went to China in early 2021, more than a year after the pandemic first emerged) and China's acute sensitivity over the pandemic. Beijing has refuted accusations that it withheld information and was slow to warn global health agencies of the new coronavirus when it emerged, and has vehemently denied that it was to blame for the initial outbreak that has gone on to severely damage the global economy and kill nearly 2.8 million people so far. According to a draft copy obtained by The Associated Press , the conclusion of the joint WHO-China study set to be released later Tuesday will reiterate its initial findings that the virus most likely originated in animals, and will propose further investigation into every scenario — except for the lab leak hypothesis. Transparency, or a lack thereof, has been a persistent bugbear throughout the coronavirus pandemic, a global health crisis that few governments appeared prepared for. The U.K. has already said it will launch a new health security agency to ensure that the country is ready for any future pandemics. The lack of international coordination during the pandemic has also appeared to be stark, with vaccine supply and distribution the latest source of acrimony between countries, particularly between the EU and U.K. The international leaders now calling for an international pandemic treaty say the main objective of the agreement would be "to promote a nationwide and societal approach that strengthens national, regional and global capacities and resilience to future pandemics." The system proposed would see increased international cooperation in order to improve warning systems, the shared use of data and research, as well as the "local, regional and global development and distribution of measures in the field of medicine and public health, e.g. vaccines, drugs, diagnostics and personal protective equipment." Perhaps equally as important, the treaty would seek to foster "more transparency, cooperation and responsibility" among signatories, leaders hope. "Such a treaty would lead to more mutual accountability and shared responsibility, transparency and cooperation in the international system in accordance with its rules and norms," they said. "To do this, we will work with world leaders and all stakeholders including civil society and the private sector. We believe that, as heads of state and government and heads of international institutions, we have a responsibility to ensure that the world learns the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic." The Group of Seven (G-7) of industrial nations, is expected to explore the pandemic treaty idea further at a summit in Cornwall, in the U.K., in June.
Germany has suspended use of the coronavirus vaccine created by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford in the under-60s, due to renewed concerns over reports of blood clots. The move comes after the country's medicines regulator found 31 cases of a rare type of blood clot in people vaccinated with the vaccine produced by the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker.	Germany has suspended use of the coronavirus vaccine created by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford in the under-60s, due to renewed concerns over reports of blood clots. The move comes after the country's medicines regulator found 31 cases of a rare type of blood clot in a small number of people immunized with the coronavirus vaccine produced by the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker. The suspension is likely to deal yet another blow to its vaccine's reputation. Initially, a few regions suspended some use of the shot Tuesday due to concerns over a possible link to rare but serious forms of blood clots. But then on Tuesday it was announced that the whole country would no longer give the vaccine to anyone under 60 years old following advice from the country's independent vaccine committee, known as STIKO. The committee said in a statement on Tuesday that "after several consultations, the majority of the STIKO decided, with the help of external experts, to only recommend the Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine for people aged 60 and over." This decision was "based on the currently available data on the occurrence of rare but very severe thromboembolic side effects. This side effect occurred 4 to 16 days after vaccination, predominantly in people (under) 60 years of age," it said. With regard to the question of administering the second vaccine dose to younger people who have already received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Germany's vaccine committee said it would issue guidance on the matter by the end of April. Germany's Paul Ehrlich Institute, a federal agency and medical regulatory body, told CNBC that there had been 31 cases of blood clots in the cerebral veins — a condition known as sinus vein thrombosis or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis  — reported to it as part of spontaneous recording. Within that number, thrombocytopenia (a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of platelets in the blood) was also reported in 19 cases. In nine of those cases, the people affected died. All but two of the 31 cases involved women aged 20 to 63 years while the two men affected were 36 and 57 years old, the Paul Ehrlich Institute said. It added that it "continues to investigate and evaluate all incoming case reports and is actively involved in the relevant discussions at the EMA," the European Medicines Agency, where case reports from all EU member states are evaluated. To put the numbers in context, almost 2.7 million people in Germany had received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine as of Monday, with 767 people having had a second dose, according to data from Germany's public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute. Chancellor Angela Merkel said the suspension of the vaccine's use in the under-60s would help to boost citizens' trust, which has already been dented when it comes to the AstraZeneca vaccine after a series of missteps, arguably both on the part of the drugmaker, and by European leaders . "Everything is based on one principle and that is trust," Merkel said at a news conference, Reuters reported. "Confidence arises from the knowledge that every suspicion is counted in every individual case." The 66-year old chancellor added that she would also be willing to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine "when it is my turn," Deutsche Welle reported. Nonetheless, Germany's move is bound to cause more pain to AstraZeneca and public confusion and concern toward the vaccine. AstraZeneca has already seen its shot suspended once before in a handful of European countries, before the EMA and World Health Organization reviewed the vaccine's safety data and concluded that was "safe and effective" and its benefits outweighed any risks. The EMA said at the time, however, that it could not rule out any link between the shot and blood clots, which are a regular occurrence in the general population at any rate. Concerns have been raised enough for Canada to also suspend use of the vaccine in the under-55s over fears of a possible link to blood clots. Clinical and real-world data have shown the vaccine to dramatically reduce Covid cases, hospitalizations and deaths , however. The vaccine is a major component of the U.K.'s, and other countries' immunization programs, and is seen as a cost-effective vaccine that can be easily transported and stored. On Wednesday, the WHO said it continues to monitor safety evidence reviews of the vaccine but that the shot's benefit-risk profile "weighs heavily in favor of its use," Reuters reported. Alejandro Cravioto, chair of the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, told a briefing the panel was "comfortable" with the vaccine's use, since many of the countries using it have safety warning systems in place and are not reporting problems. Many scientists and the U.K. government have defended the shot , saying it has already saved thousands of lives. In a statement to CNBC, AstraZeneca said international regulators had found the benefits of its jab outweighed any possible risks significantly. It said it was continuing to analyze its database of tens of millions of records for the vaccine to understand "whether these very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia occur any more commonly than would be expected naturally in a population of millions of people." "We will continue to work with German authorities to address any questions they may have," it added. The drugmaker stressed that "tens of millions of people have now received our vaccine across the globe. The extensive body of data from two large clinical datasets and real-world evidence demonstrate its effectiveness, reaffirming the role the vaccine can play during this public health crisis." Previously, Germany had not given the vaccine to people 65 and over, saying there was insufficient data on its efficacy in that age group. As more data emerged showing it was safe and effective, however, it reversed that policy.
EU citizens had to contend with a barrage of news coverage and negative sentiment toward the AstraZeneca vaccine. Even from top officials themselves. The shot was suspended by more than a dozen European countries following concerns over a small number of reports of blood clots. Age usage guidance surrounding the vaccine has been changed several times.	LONDON — There are signs that Europe's diverging — and changing — usage rules when it comes to the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford are sowing further confusion and mistrust among citizens. Not only have EU citizens had to contend with a barrage of negative sentiment toward the vaccine, even from top officials themselves, but they've also seen the shot suspended by more than a dozen European countries following concerns over a small number of reports of blood clots. The European Medicines Agency and World Health Organization, following safety reviews of the data, recommended continued use of the shot, saying its benefits outweighed possible risks. But those fears have not gone away, with confusion now reigning over which age group should, and can, take the vaccine. On Tuesday, Germany suspended use of the AstraZeneca shot in all citizens under 60, citing renewed concerns after a small number of reports of rare but serious blood clots. Earlier this week, some hospitals in Berlin had initially stopped vaccinating women under 55 with AstraZeneca's shot. Germany had initially only permitted the vaccine to be used in the under-65s, saying there was not enough data to show it was safe and effective for the elderly, although it reversed that decision in early March. Meanwhile, Spain decided on Wednesday to extend the use of the vaccine to essential workers over 65 years old. The vaccine had until then been restricted to the 55-to-65 age group, but will now be made available to priority groups in that age group such as health workers, police officers or teachers. In France, the AstraZeneca vaccine was also initially not permitted for the over-65s, with French President Emmanuel Macron, now criticized for his armchair epidemiology by many French commentators, saying erroneously that the vaccine was "quasi-ineffective" for the over-65s. France later reversed that stance as more clinical trial data emerged, saying that the vaccine would be allowed for people affected by co-morbidities, including those aged between 65 and 74. Confused yet? You're not alone. Comments on Twitter show that people on both sides are confused over official stances toward the vaccine. One Twitter user based in Germany noted that "you can't blame people for being confused" after he listed the twists and turns that have characterized the timeline of AstraZeneca's vaccine. Another user, Aetera, based in Germany noted that "everyone here is confused whether it is good or bad" while another British Twitter user, Mike Carrivick, said the reversal of usage rules around the vaccine was the "irony of ironies" but one with a potentially serious consequence. He noted: "No wonder many are confused and lives put at risk." London-based Kristen Covo was another Twitter user expressing her confusion over AstraZeneca's safety credentials following its suspension in a handful of European countries, and then the resumption of its use following the EMA and WHO's advice. With regard to the question of administering the second vaccine dose to younger people who have already received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Germany's vaccine committee said it would issue guidance on the matter by the end of April. The ambivalent, and changing, stance taken by European countries toward the vaccine has been made all the more confusing by an accompanying narrative (and big dispute) over supplies of the shot. The EU has repeatedly lambasted the drugmaker for not living up to its supply delivery schedule while at the same time, various EU officials and leaders have provoked doubts on the vaccine's efficacy, which in turn has prompted vaccine skepticism among many EU citizens. One BBC reporter based in Brussels noted that it had been labeled the "Aldi vaccine," after the low-cost grocery store, because people saw the shot as the budget option . There are other reports of people requesting the Pfizer - BioNTech or Moderna shots instead of the AstraZeneca vaccine. As one English Twitter user called gazztrade questioned on Wednesday, does the EU "want the AstraZeneca vaccine or not?" To date, only 10% of Europe's total population has received one vaccine dose and 4% have completed a full vaccine series, according to data compiled by WHO. The United Nations health agency has described the region's vaccine rollout as " unacceptably slow ."
Chancellor Angela Merkel appealed to Germans on Thursday to stay at home over Easter and meet fewer people to help curb a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Merkel was accused of losing her grip on the COVID-19 crisis last week after she ditched plans for an extended Easter holiday agreed two days earlier with governors of Germany's 16 states. On Thursday, the city government of Berlin said it will impose a nighttime ban on gatherings from Friday and only allow children of essential workers to attend nursery from next week.	Chancellor Angela Merkel appealed to Germans on Thursday to stay at home over Easter and meet fewer people to help curb a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic, as the capital Berlin announced a nighttime ban on gatherings from Friday. "It should be a quiet Easter, with those closest to you, with very reduced contact. I urge you to refrain from all non-essential travel," Merkel said in a video message, adding this was the only way to help doctors and nurses fight the virus. Merkel was accused of losing her grip on the COVID-19 crisis last week after she ditched plans for an extended Easter holiday agreed two days earlier with governors of Germany's 16 states. She has since tried to shift the blame for the third wave of the pandemic onto state premiers, accusing them of failing to stick to earlier agreements to reimpose restrictions if infections rose. On Thursday, the city government of Berlin said it will impose a nighttime ban on gatherings from Friday and only allow children of essential workers to attend nursery from next week. As the weather has turned warm in recent days, Berliners have been flocking to public spaces. About a hundred youngsters threw bottles and stones at police in one park on Wednesday when they tried to break up the party, the Berliner Zeitung reported. Merkel said it was no longer the elderly who were fighting for their lives in the pandemic, but the middle-aged and even younger patients who were ending up on ventilators in hospital. She held out hope, however, that the sluggish distribution of vaccinations would speed up after Easter, when family doctors will start giving shots. Christian Karagiannidis, the scientific head of the DIVI association for intensive and emergency medicine, said Germany needs a two-week lockdown, faster vaccinations and compulsory tests at schools if hospitals are not to be overwhelmed. "If this rate continues, we will reach the regular capacity limit in less than four weeks," he told the Rheinische Post daily. "We are not over-exaggerating. Our warnings are driven by the figures." The Berlin city government said people would only be allowed to be outside on their own or with one other person from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m., though children under 14 are exempted. This will be the first limited curfew imposed in Berlin since the pandemic began a year ago. The city of Hamburg already announced on Wednesday it will restrict nighttime outings from Friday, with supermarkets and takeaways shut from 9 p.m. Unlike Britain and France, Germany's 16 states, which run their own healthcare and security affairs, have been reluctant to impose drastic limits on movement out of fear of further damaging the economy, as well as an aversion to far-reaching restrictions on freedoms in a country wary of its Nazi past. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany, Europe's most populous country and largest economy, rose 24,300 to 2.833 million on Thursday, the biggest daily increase since Jan. 14. The reported death toll rose by 201 to 76,543.
With the death toll nearing 100,000, intensive care units in the hardest-hit regions at breaking point and a slower-than-planned vaccine rollout, Macron was forced to abandon his goal of keeping the country open to protect the economy. "We will lose control if we do not move now," the president said in a televised address to the nation.	President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday ordered France into its third national lockdown and said schools would close for three weeks as he sought to push back a third wave of Covid-19 infections that threatens to overwhelm hospitals. With the death toll nearing 100,000, intensive care units in the hardest-hit regions at breaking point and a slower-than-planned vaccine rollout, Macron was forced to abandon his goal of keeping the country open to protect the economy. "We will lose control if we do not move now," the president said in a televised address to the nation. His announcement means that movement restrictions already in place for more than a week in Paris, and some northern and southern regions, will now apply to the whole country for at least a month, from Saturday. Departing from his pledge to safeguard education from the pandemic, Macron said schools will close for three weeks after this weekend. Macron, 43, had sought to avoid a third large-scale lockdown since the start of the year, betting that if he could steer France out of the pandemic without locking the country down again he would give the economy a chance to recover from last year's slump. But the former investment banker's options narrowed as more contagious strains of the coronavirus swept across France and much of Europe. For school-children after this weekend, learning will be done remotely for a week, after which schools go on a two-week holiday, which for most of the country will be earlier than scheduled. Thereafter, nursery and primary pupils will return to school while middle and high school pupils continue distance learning for an extra week. "It is the best solution to slow down the virus," Macron said, adding that France had succeeded in keeping its schools open for longer during the pandemic than many neighbours. Faster vaccinations Daily new infections in France have doubled since February to average nearly 40,000. The number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care has breached 5,000, exceeding the peak hit during a six-week-long lockdown late last year. Bed capacity in critical care units will be increased to 10,000, Macron said. The new lockdown risks slowing the pace of France's economic recovery from last year's slump. It will force the temporary closure of 150,000 businesses at a cost of 11 billion euros ($12.89 billion) per month, the finance ministry said The set-back for France, the euro zone's second-largest economy, may also dampen Europe's hopes of bouncing back swiftly from the pandemic, in the way that the U.S. and Chinese economies are doing. France's new lockdown underlines the cost of the European Union's slow rollout of anti-COVID vaccines. Neighbouring Britain, which finalised its divorce with the bloc on Jan. 1., has inoculated nearly half its population against the coronavirus and is re-opening its economy just as France hunkers down once again. Macron said the vaccine campaign needed to be accelerated. Mired early on in red tape and slowed by supply shortages, it is only now finding its stride three months in, with just 12% of the population inoculated. Bringing the calendar forward, Macron said people in their sixties would be eligible for a shot from mid-April and those in their fifties a month later. A goal of 30 million adults inoculated by mid-June remained the target, he said. Seeking to offer hope, Macron said the April lockdown and a swifter vaccination campaign would allow the slow re-opening of the country from mid-May, starting with museums and the outdoor terraces of bars and restaurants, albeit under strict rules. "We can see a way out of this crisis," Macron said.
A Treasury official said the department realized the companies were owned by different individuals than the Bazzoni it blacklisted in January. The administration on its last full day in office imposed sanctions on a different Alessandro Bazzoni over accusations he was tied to a network attempting to evade sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector.	One of the final acts of the Trump administration was almost certainly one of the most confounding for Alessandro Bazzoni, a restaurant owner in Verona, Italy. As part of a crackdown on blacklisted Venezuelan crude, former President Donald Trump's Treasury Department accidentally slapped sanctions against his company on Jan. 19 in a case of mistaken identity. "It was a mistake," Bazzoni said, speaking to Reuters by telephone from his restaurant in Verona on Thursday. On Wednesday, Treasury reversed course and acknowledged its error, removing sanctions from AMG S.A.S. Di Alessandro Bazzoni & C., as well as sanctions on what appears to be a graphic design company in Porto Torres, Italy. A Treasury official said the department realized the companies were owned by different individuals than the Bazzoni it blacklisted in January. In 2019, the Trump administration sanctioned Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela seeking to force the resignation of President Nicolas Maduro, who it accuses of corruption, human rights violations, and rigging his 2018 re-election. The administration on its last full day in office imposed sanctions on a different Alessandro Bazzoni over accusations he was tied to a network attempting to evade sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector. Treasury also slapped sanctions on companies it said were tied to Bazzoni, including AMG S.A.S. Di Alessandro Bazzoni & C., with the same address as the Dolce Gusto restaurant and pizzeria in Verona, Italy. Records show the Verona-based Bazzoni owns both companies. "They resolved the problem. I shouldn't be involved anymore," he said. "It was a mistake ... thankfully it was all resolved in a couple of months." The SerigraphicLab di Bazzoni Alessandro, also listed by OFAC, did not reply to emailed requests for comment. "At the end of the Trump administration they were doing a lot really, really fast with respect to Venezuela, Iran and China," said Tim O'Toole, a sanctions specialist at law firm Miller & Chevalier. "When you move that fast, you tend to make mistakes," he added.
The Myanmar military has shutdown broadband internet services in the latest of numerous crackdowns on protestors since the Feb. 1 coup. On Sunday, more than 100 people died in the bloodiest day since the coup began. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, the estimated death toll to date is 536, though the actual number is likely higher, AAPP said.	Myanmar has descended into chaos as protestors show no signs of backing down against the Feb. 1 military coup that ousted the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy party head. The protestors have been met with brutal force. A U.N. special envoy warned of an imminent "bloodbath" if the military doesn't end its brutal crackdown, which has taken the lives of hundreds so far. In the latest move, the military has shutdown broadband internet services, according to Reuters . Local reports from Myanmar, say protestors are getting slain in the major cities of Yangon and Mandalay, currently under martial law. May Wong, a journalist covering the crisis, posted a graphic video of the carnage. Violence across the country has spread beyond the main cities. A 13-year-old boy was killed near the Thai border in southwest Myanmar. On Sunday, more than 100 people died in the bloodiest day since the coup began. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners , the estimated death toll to date is 536, though the actual number is likely higher, AAPP said. Violence against ethnic minorities has risen as well. The Karen National Union, a political organization in southeast Myanmar with an armed wing, claimed its Karen people were attacked by Myanmar army fighter jets in late-night airstrikes, according to Reuters . The attack breaches a 2015 cease-fire agreement. Several ethnic minority groups are now teaming up to fight back against the country's junta. Three forces in the country, including the Arakan Army have vowed to form an alliance and conduct a "spring revolution" if the violence doesn't stop, Reuters reported. "We have no other options left but to confront these serious threats posed by the illegitimate military junta's army in order to defend our territory, our Karen peoples and their self-determination rights," read a KNU statement from March 30 . In November elections, Suu Kyi's NLD won enough seats to form a government ,  but the Myanmar military, citing irregularities, contested the results. On Feb. 1, the military ousted the seated government, detaining Suu Kyi and other NLD party members. Since then, Suu Kyi has been charged with illegally importing walkie-talkies and a natural disaster violation for breaching Covid-19 protocols. Most recently, she was hit with an official secrets act charge, the most serious to date. If convicted, the prison sentence could be as much as 14 years. According to a Myanmar free expression website , the law "was created by the British colonial government in 1923 to criminalize the sharing of almost any kind of information held by the government." Local media reported more than 600 detainees were released after being charged with various alleged infractions in attempts to appease protestors. Suu Kyi and party members remain behind bars. Myanmar is no stranger to military rule. The country was run by the totalitarian Burma Socialist Programme Party for much of the last century. The country is also known as Burma. In 1988,  a student-led revolution against the military became a nationwide movement with Suu Kyi emerging as its leader. In 1990, Suu Kyi's NLD won the country's general election, the first since 1960, but the military placed the elected officials under house arrest. The Nobel Peace Prize-winning Suu Kyi remained in some form of detention for nearly 15 years. In 2015, in Myanmar's first democratic elections in 25 years , she led her party to victory. Her international reputation has suffered in recent years after she defended Myanmar military's ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya minority. But she remains popular among the country's Buddhist majority. The U.S. and European Union have imposed sanctions on military officials connected to the junta. In addition, the U.S. and U.K. placed sanctions on local companies that provide resources to the military. In its most recent action, the U.S. suspended a trade deal with Myanmar until the elected government is brought back to power. Canada and Australia have placed bans on the purchase and exportation of arms to and from Myanmar. Several other countries including Japan, France and Thailand have suspended aid to Myanmar and have halted business operations within the country. The United Nations has yet to introduce sanctions against Myanmar. Several individuals in high-ranking positions have spoken out about the ongoing violence. The U.N.'s envoy to Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, called on the Security Council on Wednesday to take collective action, warning that "a bloodbath is imminent" in Myanmar. The U.N. in a tweet recommended its employees leave the country temporarily. A group of more than 130 human rights organizations and nonprofit groups have called for the Security Council and U.N. member states to impose a global arms embargo against Myanmar. However, Russia and China sit on the Security Council and hold veto power over any U.N. effort to impose sanctions or embargoes. The Security Council issued a statement in early March which called on the military to exercise restraint and expressed support for Myanmar's democratic transition. However, Russia, China, India and Vietnam requested the removal of the word "coup" and the threat of further action, according to Reuters . China has been largely neutral as it  holds close ties with both the ousted NLD and the military junta. However, Chinese interests would be threatened by sanctions on Myanmar's resources, mining and energy companies, according to the Institut Montaigne, a French nonprofit think tank. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin met with Myanmar Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing in Naypyitaw in an effort to strengthen ties with the military, according to Reuters . Fomin said Myanmar was a strategic partner and ally, despite clear human rights abuses.
Dozens of marches and rallies are planned across Britain on Saturday as part of a "national weekend of action" against a proposed new law that would give police extra powers to curb protests. Since the bill was brought before parliament last month, there have been sporadic protests.	Dozens of marches and rallies are planned across Britain on Saturday as part of a "national weekend of action" against a proposed new law that would give police extra powers to curb protests. The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts bill would toughen measures officers can take to disperse demonstrations, such as imposing time and noise limits, which campaigners and activists fear would be used to curb dissent. Since the bill was brought before parliament last month, there have been sporadic protests, notably in Bristol, southwest England, where demonstrations turned violent with officers and a police station bombarded with bricks and glass bottles, and police vehicles set on fire. Prime Minister Boris Johnson criticized what he described as "disgraceful attacks" on officers, but protesters have accused police of using heavy-handed tactics. On Saturday, activists, climate change campaigners, and the Black Lives Matter movement say they will join "kill the bill" rallies in London and other towns and cities including Manchester, Leeds, Brighton and Bristol. "As protest is criminalized and our fake democracy is pushed further towards authoritarianism, we seek to find where we can come together with other movements to tackle the common causes that affect us all," said Alanna Byrne from environmental group Extinction Rebellion. Days of protests by her group paralyzed parts of London in early 2019, action which helped fuel calls from some politicians for the police to be given the tougher powers to prevent excessive disruption. Demonstrations had not been permitted while a coronavirus lockdown was in place, but restrictions were eased this week, meaning organized rallies can go ahead providing they are "Covid secure." In London, police warned, "enforcement action will be taken, if needed, in the interests of public health." Some senior officers have said the "kill the bill" tag was deliberately provocative as "the bill" is a nickname in Britain for the police.
A significant rise in tensions between Russia and Ukraine in recent weeks is prompting fears of a revival of the military conflict. Since Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, there have been ongoing skirmishes between Ukraine's troops and pro-Russian separatists in Donbass. The fighting is believed to have killed around 14,000 people.	LONDON — A significant rise in tensions between Russia and Ukraine in recent weeks is prompting fears of a revival of the military conflict. Since Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, there have been ongoing skirmishes between Ukraine's troops and pro-Russian separatists in Donbass, a region in eastern Ukraine. The fighting, which has been punctuated by periods of cease-fire (which both sides have accused the other of violating), is believed to have killed around 14,000 people. Last week, Ukraine said four of its soldiers had been killed by shelling by Russian forces in Donbass. Earlier in March, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of Ukraine, Ruslan Khomchak, said that Russia's "armed aggression" in the Donbass was a "major threat" not only to Ukraine's national security but to all NATO allies. Earlier this week, he said there has been a buildup of Russian troops near the border. Russia's actions have not gone unnoticed in the U.S. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated Washington's support for Ukraine's territorial integrity "in the face of Russia's ongoing aggression," the State Department said in a statement. Speaking to Ukraine's foreign minister, Blinken "expressed concern about the security situation in eastern Ukraine and offered condolences on the recent loss of four Ukrainian soldiers," the statement added. The Kremlin said Wednesday it was concerned by rising tensions in eastern Ukraine and that it feared Kyiv's forces could do something to restart a conflict. "We express concern over the growing tension and express concern that one way or another the Ukrainian side could take provocative actions that would lead to war. We really don't want to see that," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to Reuters. "I mean a civil war, which there already was there," Peskov said, when asked to clarify on a conference call with reporters. Speaking on Tuesday to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who have tried to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed "serious concern about the escalation of armed confrontation on the contact line being provoked by Ukraine" and, as Russia sees it, Ukraine's "refusal" to honor agreements that were part of the latest cease-fire coordinated in July. Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, noted on Wednesday that "it feels like Putin is trying to test and probe the West's defences and resolve to confront him — maybe this is a prelude to a new military offensive in Ukraine." "It feels like Putin is readying for some big step — maybe a diversion for his own problems at home with Navalny and focus on ... State Duma elections. A victory in Ukraine would throw some red meat again to the nationalist crowd in Russia and expose the weakness again of the West," he added, referring to jailed Russian dissident Alexei Navalny. Ash advised Russia watchers to keep an eye on water shortages that have been experienced in Crimea. the roots of which were laid seven years ago when Ukraine shut off the North Crimean Canal, cutting off the majority of the region's fresh water supply. "If anywhere I would watch south and to the water problems being experienced in Crimea. The risk is that Russia is trying diversionary tactics in Donbass when the bigger prize would be a military thrust into Ukraine to capture water courses which supply Crimea with water," Ash said. "Maybe Putin thinks the West is weak and divided and unable to respond," Ash continued, citing inadequate sanctions by the Joe Biden administration on, for example, the Nordstream gas pipeline, over the SolarWinds hack that breached U.S. government networks , and 2016 election meddling "as a signal that the U.S. is just petrified to act for fear of what Russia might do."
Describing vaccines as an "essential tool" in the pandemic battle, Francis called for a "spirit of global responsibility" to ensure poorer nations receive shots. He sounded a note of indignation at the start of his address, decrying that there has been no shortage of war and conflict during the world's worst health crisis in a century.	Pope Francis in his traditional Easter Sunday address denounced as "scandalous" how armed conflicts continue to rage even as the coronavirus pandemic has triggered severe social and economic suffering and swollen the ranks of the poor. Francis tempered his "Urbi et Orbi″ address (Latin for "To the city and to the world") wishes of joy on the Christian feast day along with accounts of pain from the globe's many armed conflicts in Africa, the Mideast, Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe. Describing vaccines as an "essential tool" in the pandemic battle, Francis called for a "spirit of global responsibility" as he encouraged nations to overcome "delays in the distribution of vaccines" and ensure that the shots reach the poorest nations. "Everyone, especially the most vulnerable among us, requires assistance and has the right to have access to necessary care," the pontiff said. He sounded a note of indignation at the start of his address, decrying that there has been no shortage of war and conflict during the world's worst health crisis in a century. "The pandemic is still spreading, while the social and economic crisis remains severe, especially for the poor. Nevertheless — and this is scandalous — armed conflicts have not ended, and military arsenals are being strengthened,″ Francis said, sounding angry. "That is today's scandal." The pontiff prayed that public authorities would see to it that those needing assistance have a "decent standard of living. Sadly, the pandemic has dramatically increased the number of the poor and the despair of thousands of people." He lamented the plight of people afflicted by war and other conflicts, citing Haiti, one of the world's poorest countries and which has been wracked by violent protests and political strife including an alleged coup. Francis urged Haitians "not to be overwhelmed by difficulties, but to look to the future with confidence and hope." Francis offered encouragement to young people in Myanmar who are "committed to supporting democracy and making their voices heard peacefully." Demonstrators in Myanmar took to the streets holding painted eggs in a reference to Easter. Myanmar's military has violently sought to quash those opposed to a Feb. 1 coup that ousted a democratically elected government. Francis thanked Lebanon and Jordan for taking in refugees from war in Syria, praying that peace finally comes to "millions are living in inhumane conditions." He also prayed for ends to conflicts in Yemen and Libya. Citing suffering of people in Africa, he decried "internal violence and international terrorism, especially in the Sahel and Nigeria." Other troubled areas he mentioned were Ethiopia's Tigray province and Mozambique's Cabo Delgado province, which has been blooded by days of fighting with rebels for control of a town. Francis prayed for the safe return home of prisoners of long conflicts in Europe, in eastern Ukraine and in Nagorno-Karabkh. Earlier in the day, Francis celebrated Easter Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, where the faithful in the pews barely numbered 200 in keeping with pandemic protocols, compared to the usual thousands. Normally, Francis would give his Easter speech about world affairs  from the central balcony of the basilica overlooking St. Peter's Square. Instead, for the second consecutive Easter, he read it indoors to discourage crowds from gathering. "Dear brothers and sisters, once again this year, in various places, many Christians have celebrated Easter under severe restrictions and, at times, without being able to attend liturgical celebrations," Francis said, before offering a special Apostolic blessing to faithful worldwide. "We pray that those restrictions, as well as all restrictions on freedom of worship and religion worldwide, may be lifted and everyone be allowed to pray and praise God freely,″ the pontiff said.
The campaign has prompted complaints that regulators were too slow to approve the shots and led to a simmering tussle with AstraZeneca as the pharmaceutical giant repeatedly slashed its delivery commitments. It's a messy picture, further complicated by the unique nature of European politics. Despite several issues so far, the EU is confident that the next three months will prove to be a turning point in the vaccine program.	LONDON — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it herself: "The start was tough." The European Union has had a bumpy Covid-19 vaccine rollout. The campaign has prompted complaints that regulators were too slow to approve the shots and led to a simmering tussle with AstraZeneca as the pharmaceutical giant repeatedly slashed its delivery commitments. More recently, several countries briefly halted their use of the Oxford- AstraZeneca vaccine amid safety concerns, a move that baffled health experts and raised questions about future uptake. The World Health Organization expressed concern earlier this week that the region's ongoing coronavirus crisis now appears " more worrying " than it has for several months. The warning comes as many countries introduce new measures in an attempt to curb a third wave of infections. The health agency also described Europe's vaccination campaign as "unacceptably slow" and said it was crucial to speed up the rollout because new infections are currently increasing in every age group apart from those aged 80 years or older. It's a messy picture, further complicated by the unique nature of European politics. "There have been various problems with the system, and it is a complex system, so I think it's key not to point the finger to one pointed failure but recognize that it's very complex," Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told CNBC. The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, has been in charge of negotiating contracts with the pharmaceutical firms on behalf of the 27 member states. The institution is also responsible for overseeing the exports of the shots produced in the bloc. However, health policy matters are a competence of the member states, which means the 27 capitals organize the inoculations in their own countries and can ultimately decide to buy Covid shots outside the deals struck by the commission, for example. This juxtaposition between national and EU institutions has often hindered the reputation of the bloc in the wider vaccination efforts. "There is issues to do with both (national and EU institutions). There clearly are politics in it and we have all heard about that in the media, but there are also issues to do with the decision-making structures, the commissions' views and the priorities of member states," Bauld told CNBC. This was highlighted recently when 13 EU countries decided to halt the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot while possible side effects were investigated. At the time, the European Medicines Agency – the drugs regulator for the entire 27-member region — recommended that countries continue to use the vaccine even while it was reviewing data of blood clots in some vaccinated people. But some member states preferred to be cautious and used their sovereign power to stop the use of this vaccine while the EMA completed its review. The drug regulator's safety committee concluded in a preliminary review that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risk of side effects. It has also been the case that heads of state have used the institutions in Brussels to complain about the hiccups in the process. Earlier in March, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said there was "secrecy" in the decision to distribute the vaccines at the commission's steering board. The group, which is chaired by the commission, has representatives from all the member states, including Austria. "Why do they come up with this now knowing that Austria is a member of the steering board, like the 26 other member states, and has been informed of the previous allocations like the others?" an EU official from another member state, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, asked during a CNBC interview in March. The distribution of the vaccines is carried out on a pro-rata basis, depending on the size of the countries' population. But some EU nations were particularly keen to have more of the AstraZeneca shot, since it is cheaper and easier to store than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. "If a member state decides not to take up its pro rata allocation, the doses are redistributed among the other interested member states," the commission said in a statement in March. The distribution of vaccines became an issue as a result of AstraZeneca's repeated cuts to supply deliveries. While the EU was expecting to receive 90 million doses of the shot by the end of the first quarter, the pharmaceutical giant said it could only deliver 40 million doses in that timeframe. This was later revised down to 30 million doses. AstraZeneca has blamed low yields in European plants for the lower deliveries. Additionally, the drugmaker has said it could only aim to deliver 70 million doses between April and June, when the EU was expecting 180 million in the same period. "We also know that AstraZeneca has unfortunately under-produced and under-delivered. And this painfully, of course, reduced the speed of the vaccination campaign," von der Leyen said at a press conference in March. To solve this issue, the commission proposed stricter rules on exports of shots produced in the bloc. Since the end of January, the 27 countries can stop shipments of Covid vaccines when a company is not complying with delivery targets with the EU. This is how the Italian government stopped a shipment of AstraZeneca shots from going to Australia in March. Between the end of January and late March, the commission received 315 requests for vaccine exports, but only this one was refused. But because EU officials are concerned about further delivery delays, the commission decided to toughen up the export regulations from late March onward. The commission will not only be checking whether the pharma companies are delivering on schedule, but also whether the recipient country has any bans or restrictions of Covid vaccines produced there and whether this nation also has a better epidemiological situation than the EU. "It is quite concerning at the political level the whole discussion about exports restrictions, controls or even bans," Dimitri Eynikel, coordinator at Medecins sans Frontieres, told CNBC. He added that this could lead to further obstructions, divisions and delays in vaccine distributions. Ultimately the supply chain is international and if one nation were to stop sending raw materials to the EU, for example, then that could undermine the production of the shots within the bloc. The EU's move to have stricter oversight on where vaccines go sparked criticisms of vaccine nationalism . "I think the EU is definitely prioritizing its population first but no different from other high-income countries or regions. The United States is doing the same, the U.K. is doing the same so in that sense (the EU) is no different," Eynikel said. Data shared by the International Monetary Fund has shown that China, India and the EU are among the biggest exporters of Covid shots, while the U.S. and the U.K. have exported none so far. Despite several issues so far, the EU is confident that the next three months will prove to be a turning point in the vaccine program. In total, the commission is expecting 360 million doses of Covid shots between April and June, meaning it is well placed to achieve its target of vaccinating 70% of the adult population before the end of summer. "Despite the fact that things could have gone faster, granted, but we have had a great success. The alternative of not having procured vaccines together would be that we would be competing between European member states and possibly some of us would have not have the vaccine even at this stage," Chris Fearne, Malta's health minister, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Tuesday.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen delivered a searing speech Monday that reaffirms global priorities for the U.S. Among the administration’s aims, she said, are inclusive growth and a realization that “America first must never mean America alone.” The speech provided a sharp break from the isolationist policies in place under former President Donald Trump.	Following four years of a decidedly protectionist agenda, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is here to tell you that things are about to change in a major way. The Cabinet official most in charge of President Joe Biden 's economic agenda set forth a bold set of principles Monday that differ from the previous administration's priorities by about as much as one could imagine. Gone is former President Donald Trump 's saber-rattling against China. In its place is a policy that "will be competitive where it should be, collaborative where it can be" but only "adversarial where it must be." Where Trump and his Treasury leader, Steven Mnuchin, used their pulpit not only to pick fights with traditional adversaries like China but also traditional allies such as Germany, Yellen countered with "America first must never mean America alone." And while the past administration paid generally little heed to issues like diversity and climate change, Yellen said both are at the center of not only the U.S. social agenda but also its economic one. Drawing a line between the past and present, Yellen asserted, in a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, that "the most important difference today is a fundamental recognition that our policies at home and abroad must be designed to be inclusive, tackle inequality, and respect our environment." The searing rhetoric, though, was no ordinary policy speech. Instead, it serves essentially as a curtain-raiser for this week's World Bank/International Monetary Fund spring meeting. The message: that globalization, and the U.S.'s perceived role as the center of the mission, is back in vogue. "Over the last four years, we have seen firsthand what happens when America steps back from the global stage," Yellen said. "America first must never mean America alone. For in today's world, no country alone can suitably provide a strong and sustainable economy for its people." Those weren't the only tough words Yellen had for the prior administration. Without naming Trump, she criticized the slow response to the Covid-19 pandemic , saying the White House "failed to engage early to address the crisis beyond our borders," which Yellen said made the economic aspect even worse. She stressed the importance of not just stopping the virus at home, but also in other nations. However, before the pandemic arrived, the economy had been doing well under the protectionist Trump, who often used the term "globalists" disparagingly against some of his own administration officials. Unemployment was at a 50-year low, inflation was in check, and the administration, despite its repeated alienation of allies around the world, managed to negotiate a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico and redraw arrangements elsewhere. Leading economic officials including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have lamented that the wealth gap had been closing meaningfully prior to the pandemic and now has widened again, largely the result of economic restrictions put in place to combat the virus. Despite criticism from the political left on his handling of global trade and the widespread tariffs put in place, Biden has indicated little change in that approach. The bulk of Trump's tariffs have been left in place. Further, the Trump years featured consistently above-trend economic gains not to mention a strong stock market. For Yellen, though, the message was about more than numbers. She talked about the importance of getting displaced women back in the workforce, and emphasized the important of providing aid to minorities who also have been hit disproportionately hard during the pandemic. Climate change, she said, is "the biggest long-term threat the world faces." Overall, she said the administration's aim is "to fight poverty and promote a more inclusive global economy that aligns with our values." From a headline perspective, the two big proposals were getting G-20 nations to agree on a minimum global corporate tax and another aim, announced last week, to approve $650 billion in special drawing rights that will provide U.S. dollars to IMF members. Both moves might have a distinctly global focus that the Trump administration mostly eschewed, other than an effort to bring home profits that were stashed overseas. Despite likely criticism that the Biden administration's international focus could threaten the U.S. at home, the Yellen speech sends a clear message that the days of America first are over for now. "While we embraced trade as an engine for growth, we neglected those who did not benefit. And in the most recent period, when we might have adopted policies at home to face these issues and joined with our allies to address issues abroad, we isolated ourselves and retreated from the international order that we created," Yellen said. "We can do better," she added, regarding inequality. "We must do better."
Australia said on Wednesday it will ask the European Union to release more than 3 million doses of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine, testing Brussel's claim it is not blocking shipments, as the country struggles to vaccinate its population. The European Union on Tuesday denied blocking vaccine shipments to Australia, which has fallen dramatically behind in its scheduled vaccination program. The EU said it was not responsible for AstraZeneca's failure to uphold commitments to other countries. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia was asked by the EU to withdraw export permit applications and letters requesting supplies have gone unanswered.	Australia said on Wednesday it will ask the European Union to release more than 3 million doses of AstraZeneca 's Covid-19 vaccine, testing Brussels claim it is not blocking shipments, as the country struggles to vaccinate its population. The European Union (EU) on Tuesday denied blocking vaccine shipments to Australia , which has fallen dramatically behind in its scheduled vaccination program. The EU said it was not responsible for AstraZeneca's failure to uphold commitments to other countries. AstraZeneca did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Wednesday. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia was asked by the EU to withdraw export permit applications and letters requesting supplies have gone unanswered. Morrison said if the EU was now indicating its willingness to release shipments, he would again ask for the 3.1 million doses to be released. The 3.1 million doses were scheduled to arrive in Australia by the end of March. "We obviously want those millions of doses," Morrison told reporters in the capital Canberra. "Given statements made overnight, that apparently there is no obstruction to that and then I would hope that could be readily addressed." Morrison on Wednesday insisted he was not criticizing the EU, but senior members of his government continued to blame the EU for blocking vaccines. "They're not giving approval is effectively the same as blocking," Australia's Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio. Australia says the delay in receiving the 3.1 million additional doses is why it has fallen behind in vaccinations. Australia has recorded a small number of Covid cases compared to most nations and has now eradicated the virus from its community, but its slow vaccine rollout is pressuring Morrison who is struggling in the polls a year out from the next election after a series of damaging allegations about the mistreatment of female lawmakers and staff in his Liberal party. Only about 670,000 people have been vaccinated against an initial government target of 4 million by March-end. Australia received an initial shipment of 300,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in late February, which it said was the last it received. Last month the EU, at Italy's request, blocked a shipment of 250,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Australia, citing vaccine shortages in Europe. The AstraZeneca vaccine from Europe was to underpin the early stages of Australia's vaccine drive, supplementing 50 million shots of the vaccine that will be produced locally by CSL Ltd. It has also imported doses of Pfizer 's vaccine for frontline Covid workers. Australia has recorded just over 29,000 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began.
EMA says review of AstraZeneca vaccine is ongoing. Review findings expected on Wednesday or Thursday. France, Germany, Netherlands, suspend AZ in younger people. Another EMA committee member says link "plausible."	A senior official at Europe's medicines regulator has said there is a clear "association" between AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine and very rare blood clots in the brain, though the direct cause of the clots is still unknown. The European Medical Agency (EMA) said in a statement after the comments by Marco Cavaleri, chair of its vaccine evaluation team, that it was still conducting a review of the vaccine and expected to announce its findings Wednesday or Thursday. An AstraZeneca spokesman declined to comment on Cavaleri's remarks, which he made in an interview with Italian newspaper Il Messaggero that was published on Tuesday. "In my opinion, we can now say it, it is clear that there is an association (of the brain blood clots) with the vaccine. However, we still do not know what causes this reaction," Cavaleri said, without giving evidence to support his comments. The EMA has said the benefits of the AstraZeneca shot outweigh any risks, and the World Health Organization has backed the vaccine. AstraZeneca has said previously that its studies have found no higher risk of clots because of its vaccine. The EMA is investigating 44 reports of an extremely rare brain clot known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) out of 9.2 million people who have received the vaccine in the European Economic Area, which comprises European Union member states and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Cavaleri said the EMA would say in its review that there is a link, but was not likely to give an indication this week on which age groups should or should not get the AstraZeneca shot. Some countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, have suspended the use of the vaccine in younger people while the investigations continue. In response to Cavaleri's comments, the Amsterdam-based EMA said in a statement on Tuesday: "EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) has not yet reached a conclusion and the review (of any possible link) is currently ongoing." The EMA said last week that its review had not identified any specific risk factors, such as age, gender or medical history, for these very rare events. In a separate interview, Armando Genazzani, a member of the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), told La Stampa daily that it was "plausible" that the blood clots were correlated with the AstraZeneca vaccine. A high proportion of the reported cases are in young or middle-aged women, but that has not led the EMA to conclude this group is at particular risk. Scientists are exploring several possibilities that might explain the rare brain blood clots. One theory suggests the vaccine triggers an unusual antibody in some rare cases; other investigators are looking into a possible link with birth control pills. But many experts say there is no definitive evidence and it is not clear whether or why AstraZeneca's vaccine would cause a problem not shared by other vaccines that target a similar part of the coronavirus. "We need to know more about the people affected and we need to understand exactly how the illnesses came about, while many other questions remain at this time," said Adam Finn, a professor of pediatrics at Britain's Bristol University who has been involved with UK studies of several Covid-19 vaccines, including the AstraZeneca shot and another developed by Pfizer. He said it was very clear that clotting cases were "very rare indeed" and that the vaccines that are available and in use in Britain "prevent Covid very effectively".
The Oxford-AstraZeneca shot has been dogged by safety concerns in recent weeks, with several European countries briefly suspending their use of the vaccine last month. The World Health Organization, the U.K.'s medicines regulator and the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis have all said that the benefits of administering the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot far outweigh the risks. AstraZeneca has previously said its studies have found no higher risk of blood clots as a result of its vaccine.	LONDON — Europe's medicines regulator found a possible link between the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford and rare blood clotting issues — though it said the benefits of getting the shot still outweigh its risks. Unusual blood clotting with low blood platelets will be added as a "very rare" side effect to the vaccine's product information, along with a slew of other possible adverse reactions, Emer Cooke, executive director of the European Medicines Agency, said in a televised news conference Wednesday. The warning comes after the regulator's safety committee reviewed extremely rare cases of unusual blood clots in some people vaccinated with the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot. Most of the cases occurred in women under 60 within two weeks of the shot, officials said. The EMA hasn't yet identified specific risk factors that contributed to the phenomenon. Researchers also don't know what's specifically causing the blood clots, but one plausible explanation is that the vaccine causes an immune response in some people that's similar to one seen in patients treated with heparin, which is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, Cooke said. "This case clearly demonstrates one of the challenges posed with large-scale vaccination campaigns," she said. "When millions of people receive these vaccines, very rare events can occur that were not identified in the clinical trials." Separately, the U.K.'s medicine regulator said on Wednesday that it also identified a possible link between the shot and the rare blood clots. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, similarly said the benefits of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine outweighed the risks for most people. Britain's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said people under 30 who don't have any underlying health conditions should get a different vaccine if possible. The EMA, which flagged other possible side effects, added that it was of "great importance" that health-care professionals and people receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine were aware of the risks and to watch for possible symptoms that typically occur in the first two weeks after inoculation. "These include, for example, shortness of breath, chest pain, swelling in the leg, persistent abdominal pain, neurological symptoms including severe or persistent headache or blurred vision and skin bruising beyond the site of injection," Dr. Sabine Straus, chair of EMA's safety committee, said at the same news conference. Those side effects will be listed as possible adverse drug reactions on the vaccine's product information, she said. Shares of AstraZeneca closed down around 1% in London. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the U.K.'s deputy chief medical officer, described the country's new advice on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as a "course correction" for the U.K. The MHRA, the body that approved it for use in the U.K., has been looking at the data following the reports — both in the U.K. and in continental Europe — of serious but rare blood clots, some of which have been fatal. A U.K. trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on children had already been paused while the medicines regulator investigated a possible link between the shot and the blood clotting disorders, specifically, cases of blood clots in veins within the brain, known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) as well as thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets which help the blood to clot). The U.K. government noted that, up to and including March 24, there had been 22 reports of CVST and eight reports of other thrombosis events with low platelets, out of a total of 18.1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine (a two-dose shot) given by that date. The Oxford-AstraZeneca shot has been dogged by safety concerns in recent weeks, with several European countries briefly suspending their use of the vaccine last month. The EMA said on March 31 that it had found the shot to be safe and effective, but added it could not rule out the possibility of a causal link between the vaccine and clotting events so would continue to investigate. The World Health Organization, the U.K.'s medicines regulator and the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis have all said that the benefits of administering the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot far outweigh the risks. AstraZeneca has previously said its studies have found no higher risk of blood clots as a result of its vaccine. Most countries have since resumed use of the shot but many have suspended inoculations across certain age groups. The EMA had denied any known link between the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot and rare blood clots before Tuesday when a senior official at Europe's medicines regulator reportedly said there is a clear "association" between the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and very rare blood clots in the brain. In an interview with Italian newspaper Il Messaggero published Tuesday, Marco Cavaleri, chair of the EMA's vaccine evaluation team, said: "In my opinion we can now say it, it is clear that there is an association with the vaccine. However, we still do not know what causes this reaction." — CNBC's Holly Ellyatt contributed to this report.
The ECB put forward an emergency bond-buying program in March of 2020 to deal with the economic shock from the pandemic. This program, knows as the PEPP, is currently set to last until March 2022 and total up to 1.85 trillion euros ($2.2 trillion). Hawkish members of the euro zone's central bank are less keen to use the full amount provided by the emergency purchase program, wary of a long and significant intervention in markets.	Robert Holzmann, the governor of Austria's central bank, told CNBC Thursday that he believed the European Central Bank might be able to start reducing its bond purchases during the summer. "When we decided in December an extension of the PEPP program we made a change by changing from a volume that needs to be spent, to a volume which can be spent," he said. "So what amount of money that will be spent is dependent on the quarter in advance and the decision for the third quarter, we'll make (it) at the end of the second quarter, and hopefully, by that time, there will be a possibility to reduce again the purchases," Holzmann told CNBC's "Street Signs Europe." The ECB put forward an emergency bond-buying program in March of 2020 to deal with the economic shock from the pandemic. This program, knows as the PEPP, is currently set to last until March 2022 and total up to 1.85 trillion euros ($2.2 trillion). Hawkish members of the euro zone's central bank are less keen to use the full amount provided by the emergency purchase program, wary of a long and significant intervention in markets. But dovish members of the ECB are more cautious about lifting the stimulus pedal too soon given that the euro zone economy is still to fragile. Reducing asset purchases in the latter half of this year, and fading out the PEPP, could therefore be helpful in this wider debate over the ECB's methods. The German constitutional court has questioned the legality of the ECB's original asset purchase program, one that was introduced before the pandemic to deal with the 2011 sovereign debt crisis. More recently, the court also stopped the approval of EU-wide fiscal funds, due to concerns that European laws do not allow the 27 EU member states to package up and issue new debt jointly. Some experts are worried that the court will soon question the ECB's pandemic purchase program as well, which could be an issue for the economic recovery in the region. In the meantime, one of the current risks for the euro zone is a potential increase in borrowing costs as inflation expectations rise. Earlier on Thursday, ECB member Klaas Knot told CNBC that the central bank could frontload bond purchases as a way to contain borrowing costs (the sovereign debt yields) for euro area governments. "If it (rising bond yields) is due to better growth and inflation prospects then that's entirely benign, but if it is due to spillovers coming from different regions in the world then I think it is entirely legitimate for us to temporarily frontload some of the purchases," Knot said. His comment highlights the flexibility of the ECB's purchase program — an element that President Christine Lagarde often refers to. Overall, the assessment for the euro area seems more positive than a few months back. In addition to expecting fewer bond purchases in the latter part of 2021, Austria's central bank chief also sees upside risks for the euro zone economy, given that business activity and vaccination rates are picking up. "There might have been some glitches in vaccination in recent weeks and months," he said, but "with vaccination we have now an instrument which could clearly lead us out of this economic downturn." The ECB has forecast a 4% GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate for the euro area this year, after the region contracted almost 7% in 2020. The central bank sees GDP standing 2.3% above pre-crisis levels by the end of 2023.
"We have both upside and downside risks, depending on the speed of the vaccine rollout and the extent of virus mutations," Finnish central bank governor Olli Rehn told CNBC's "Street Signs Europe." "In this context, the best approach in monetary policy is simply to keep calm and stay the course," he added. His comments come shortly after Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot had reportedly suggested an expected rebound for the euro zone economy in the second half of the year could allow the ECB to begin phasing out its emergency bond purchases in the third quarter.	LONDON — The European Central Bank should look to secure a sustained economic recovery in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic before exiting crisis-fighting measures, Finland's central bank chief told CNBC on Thursday. "We are ready to recalibrate our purchases as needed and in that sense, as I said, I would be rather cautious in this regard as I think it is better to be safe than sorry and see that we genuinely have a sustained recovery in the economy before we move to the exit gear in terms of monetary accommodation," Finnish central bank governor Olli Rehn told CNBC's "Street Signs Europe." "We have both upside and downside risks, depending on the speed of the vaccine rollout and the extent of virus mutations. In this context, the best approach in monetary policy is simply to keep calm and stay the course," he added. His comments come shortly after Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot  told Reuters that an expected rebound for the euro zone economy in the second half of the year could allow the ECB to begin phasing out its emergency bond purchases in the third quarter. The ECB last month decided to ramp up bond buying within its 1.85 trillion euro ($2.2 trillion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, sometimes referred to as PEPP. The move came amid worries that rising government bond yields (how much it costs them to borrow) could threaten the bloc's economic recovery. The euro area is still waiting for coronavirus relief funds at the EU level, and many countries are grappling with a third wave of coronavirus infections, as the pace of vaccinations lags other parts of the world. All of these factors pose risks to the 19 economies that share the euro. The International Monetary Fund said in its World Economic Outlook on Tuesday that the euro area was on track to grow 4.4% this year, following a contraction of 6.6% last year. "In the near term, there is still plenty of uncertainty about the speed of the vaccine rollout (and) about the possible extent of virus mutations. But, yes, in the second half of this year and next year, we see the recovery strengthening and certainly, the outlook in this sense is more positive," Finland's Rehn said. "In terms of policy response, it is better to be safe than sorry and maintain a significant degree of accommodation in monetary policy in order to build a sturdy bridge over these troubled waters of the coronavirus pandemic." — CNBC's Silvia Amaro contributed to this report.
Coronavirus vaccine maker CureVac has said it hopes its coronavirus shot will receive European approval in the second quarter. CureVac's CEO Franz-Werner Haas told CNBC Thursday that the vaccine maker was close to finalizing the recruitment for the vaccine's Phase 3 clinical trial. The company hopes that approval of its shot could come not long after, given the urgent need for additional effective coronavirus vaccines.	Coronavirus vaccine maker CureVac has said it hopes its Covid shot will receive European approval in the second quarter. CureVac's CEO Franz-Werner Haas told CNBC Thursday that the vaccine maker was close to finalizing the recruitment for the vaccine's Phase 3 clinical trial. Approval could come not long after, he said, given the urgent need for additional effective coronavirus vaccines and the expedited regulatory approval process. "We are expecting, according to our calculations, that towards the end of April or beginning of May that we will have the data," Haas told CNBC's Squawk Box Europe. "So we expect to be given approval, depending on the data certainly, in the beginning of June." Once the trial is underway, the German biotech CureVac will wait for safety data and then conduct an interim analysis of results from the late-stage study. Crucially, it will also have to wait until a certain number of trial participants develop Covid-19 in order to see how effective the vaccine is at preventing the virus. The data is then submitted to regulatory authorities, such as the European Medicines Agency, for what's called a "rolling review;" this is where the data is analyzed by regulators as it emerges, speeding up the assessment of new, potentially life-saving vaccines or medicines during public health emergencies. The U.K. and EU have pre-ordered up to 455 million doses of CureVac's mRNA vaccine, subject to regulatory approval. The company is already producing its vaccine, despite the fact it has not yet been authorized, in anticipation of the shot's approval. CureVac CEO Haas said the company was trying to avoid manufacturing pitfalls hit by other vaccine makers. This issue has perhaps been most notable at AstraZeneca and has put the vulnerability of global supply chains into sharp relief. "Manufacturing is certainly a struggle at the moment," he said. "It's not only that we are producing by ourselves, but we have an entire network in Europe, with other companies supporting us with manufacturing there as well, but it's very hard sometimes to get the equipment, to get the facilities built-up but also the material to produce the mRNA." "But we're doing everything to get as many doses produced as we can," Haas added.
The British government and health experts in the country have rushed to defend the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. It comes after medicines regulators in the EU and U.K. made announcements on Wednesday over a possible link to blood clots. One Twitter user commented Thursday that officials appear to have gone into "damage limitation" mode.	The British government and health experts in the country have rushed to defend the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford  following concerns over a possible link to blood clots. On Wednesday, t he U.K.'s health and vaccine regulators issued a change of guidance over who should receive the shot. They now recommend that anyone under the age of 30 should receive an alternative vaccine amid concerns that it could, in rare circumstances, lead to a serious blood clot. Following a safety review of the AstraZeneca vaccine, sparked by concerns over reports of rare blood clotting disorders in a small number of vaccinated individuals, both the U.K. and European medicines regulators (the MHRA and EMA, respectively) stressed that the benefits of the jab still outweighed the risks. However, amid concerns that the reputation of the vaccine could be damaged further, experts have rushed to defend it - and one Twitter user commented that officials appeared to have gone into "damage limitation" mode. On Thursday, the U.K. health secretary stressed that the risk of a blood clot after receiving the AstraZeneca Covid vaccination is about the same as on a long-haul flight. He said the safety measures surrounding the vaccine were robust and enabled regulators to "spot this extremely rare event." On the chances of developing a blood clot, Matt Hancock  told BBC Breakfast : "The safety system that we have around this vaccine is so sensitive that it can pick up events that are four in a million - I'm told this is about the equivalent risk of taking a long-haul flight." Meanwhile, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has received a first shot of the vaccine himself, said that "the best thing people should do is look at what the MHRA say, our independent regulator - that's why we have them, that's why they are independent. "Their advice to people is to keep going out there, get your jab, get your second jab," he added on Thursday. It comes amid growing concerns that Wednesday's announcement could lead to vaccine hesitancy in Britain, where the immunization program has gone well so far, with over 31.7 million adults having received a first dose of a vaccine, to date . The U.K. has been working through priority groups for a vaccine, with the under-50s (without underlying health conditions) next in line for a shot. England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam also sought to downplay concerns on Wednesday, saying that the reports of blood clots were "vanishingly rare." He also noted that "changes in preference for vaccines are business as usual and this is a course correction." "If you sail a massive liner across the Atlantic, then it's not really reasonable that you aren't going to have to make at least one course correction during that voyage," he said at a press briefing, adding that the vaccines were be kept under "very careful review." Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases at Cardiff University School of Medicine, was among the experts saying the move by the U.K. to restrict the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine was sensible. "It does sound like a sensible decision based on the evidence we have so far of a probable causal link between the AZ vaccine and these very rare thrombotic side effects that have been noted," he told CNBC Thursday. However he noted that vaccine hesitancy was now "clearly a concern." "It's going to be important to keep on emphasizing the message that vaccination is saving lives and has already saved thousands of lives in the U.K. already," he added. Meanwhile, Andrew Pollard, professor of pediatric infection and immunity at the University of Oxford, which developed the shot along with AstraZeneca, said in a statement Wednesday that "safety has been our priority throughout the development of the vaccine ... and we are reassured to see that safety monitoring continues under the close scrutiny of regulators and public health authorities as the vaccine is rolled out around the world." Countries in mainland Europe are likely to have a harder time convincing their citizens that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe, given the numerous doubts and disputes over the shot and supplies to date. After a second review into the shot, the European Medicines Agency also ruled on Wednesday that the vaccine was safe, but said it found a "possible link" between the jab and very rare cases of blood clots. The EMA did not place any age restrictions on recipients, however. The agency's Executive Director Emer Cooke looked to reassure the public, noting that researchers were still trying to find out what has been causing a small number of rare but serious clots, including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). The issue, "clearly demonstrates one of the challenges posed by large scale vaccination campaigns when millions of people receive these vaccines, very rare events can occur that were not identified during the clinical trials," she said. EU leaders met on Wednesday night but were unable to agree on a coordinated strategy regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine. To date, four European countries have stopped using the AstraZeneca vaccine altogether, including Denmark and the Netherlands, while a raft of others, including Germany, France and Spain, have put age restrictions on the shot. Most of the cases of blood clots identified by the regulators occurred in women under 60 within two weeks of the shot. Officials are still looking into specific risk factors that could have contributed to the phenomenon, however. Unusual blood clotting with low blood platelets will be added as a "very rare" side effect to the vaccine's product information, the EMA added.
The State Department denied Tuesday evening that it was discussing a joint boycott alongside allies of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. The Olympic Games are due to take place between Feb. 4 and Feb. 20. The United States has not yet made a decision.	WASHINGTON – The State Department denied Tuesday evening that it was considering a joint boycott alongside allies of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. "Our position on the 2022 Olympics has not changed. We have not discussed and are not discussing any joint boycott with allies and partners," a senior State Department official wrote in an emailed statement to CNBC. Department spokesman Ned Price had initially suggested during a press briefing earlier on Tuesday that a boycott of the Olympic Games was among the possibilities for addressing China's human rights abuses. The Olympic Games are due to take place between Feb. 4 and Feb. 20. Any discussion of a diplomatic boycott of the Olympic Games would come as the Biden administration works to rally allies to mount international pushback on China. While there is broad bipartisan support for taking a tougher policy stance against China, there is hardly unanimous agreement that a boycott would be the most productive path to pursue. Read more: Calls grow louder to boycott Beijing’s Olympics — and analysts warn of retaliation from China A former senior Treasury official, who requested anonymity to describe past deliberations on the topic, suggested such a move would reflect a "Cold War statement" on behalf of the United States. "It's better to go there and dominate," the official told CNBC. "It's better to be Jesse Owens than the Soviets in '84." (Owens, a Black American sprinter, won four gold medals at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Berlin. The Soviet Union boycotted the 1984 games in Los Angeles after the U.S. snubbed the 1980 games in Moscow in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.) Last month, the United States sanctioned two Chinese officials , citing their roles in serious human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. The sanctions by the Biden administration complement actions also taken by the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada. Beijing has previously rejected U.S. charges that it has committed genocide against the Uyghurs, a Muslim population indigenous to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in northwest China. The Foreign Ministry called such claims "malicious lies" designed to "smear China" and "frustrate China's development." The sanctions came on the heels of a contentious meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan and China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and State Councilor Wang Yi in Alaska. Ahead of the Alaska talks, Blinken slammed China's sweeping use of "coercion and aggression" on the international stage and warned that the U.S. will push back if necessary. "China uses coercion and aggression to systematically erode autonomy in Hong Kong, undercut democracy in Taiwan, abuse human rights in Xinjiang and Tibet, and assert maritime claims in the South China Sea that violate international law," Blinken said at a news conference in Japan . Biden, who spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping in February, has previously said that his approach to China would be different from his predecessor's in that he would work more closely with allies in order to mount pushback against Beijing. "We will confront China's economic abuses," Biden said in a speech at the State Department , describing Beijing as America's "most serious competitor." "But we're also ready to work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so. We'll compete from a position of strength by building back better at home and working with our allies and partners." Tensions between Beijing and Washington soared under the Trump administration, which escalated a trade war and worked to ban Chinese technology companies from doing business in the United States. Over the past four years, the Trump administration blamed China for a wide range of grievances, including intellectual property theft, unfair trade practices and recently, the coronavirus pandemic . — CNBC's Kayla Tausche contributed to this report.

"His Royal Highness passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle," Britain's royal family announced Friday. Philip married his third cousin Elizabeth in 1947. He became British consort to the sovereign after King George VI died in 1952. The Duke of Edinburgh had taken up more than 22,000 solo engagements, 637 overseas visits, delivered an estimated 5,493 speeches and worked as a patron to almost 800 organizations.	LONDON — The House of Windsor has lost its patriarch. Prince Philip, the Greece-born royal who as the husband of Queen Elizabeth II was the longest-serving consort to a British sovereign, died Friday. He was 99. "His Royal Highness passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle," the royal family announced. "Further announcements will be made in due course. The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss." After the announcement, flags were lowered to half-staff, and the BBC News channel played "God Save the Queen." The Duke of Edinburgh's death came 12 days before Queen Elizabeth's 95th birthday on April 21, two months before what would have been Philip's 100th birthday on June 10 and on the 16th anniversary of the marriage of Prince Charles and Camilla. Under a long-standing plan known as "Operation Forth Bridge," his death ushers in a period of national mourning. The royal family webpage was replaced with a tribute page in black in memory of the prince, who was married to Elizabeth for nearly 74 years. "The official website of the Royal Family is temporarily unavailable while appropriate changes are made," the royal.uk site said. At noon Saturday London time (7 a.m. Saturday ET ), a "Death Gun Salute" will be fired to mark Philip's death. Forty-one rounds will be fired at one round a minute across the United Kingdom, in Gibraltar and on Her Majesty's Ships at sea, the Defence Ministry said. In London, the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery will use the same guns that were fired for the royal couple's wedding in 1947 and for Elizabeth's coronation in 1953. The House of Commons tweeted that it will sit at 2:30 p.m. on Monday to pay tribute to the duke. Philip had insisted that he did not want the "fuss" of a state funeral at Westminster Hall, according to The Times of London . The Royal College of Arms announced that Philip's body will lie at rest in Windsor Castle ahead of the funeral in St George's Chapel, in line with custom and his wishes. It said there will be no state funeral and no lying in state. It also said the date of the funeral will be announced. "The funeral arrangements have been revised in view of the prevailing circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and it is regretfully requested that members of the public do not attempt to attend or participate in any of the events that make up the funeral," it added in a statement . Buckingham Palace added: "Those wishing to express their condolences are asked to do so in the safest way possible, and not to gather at Royal Residences." The family also asked the public to make donations to a charity instead of leaving floral tributes. Condolence messages can be posted at the royal.uk website.  Philip , whom the queen referred to as "my constant strength," was hospitalized in February after " feeling unwell, " and was treated for an infection and a preexisting heart condition, Buckingham Palace said. He was released a month later after undergoing a heart procedure. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement that "it was with great sadness" he had been informed of Philip's death, reflecting on the duke's "extraordinary life and work" and offering his condolences to the queen. "Like the expert carriage driver that he was he helped to steer the royal family and the monarchy so that it remains an institution indisputably vital to the balance and happiness of our national life," Johnson said. "We mourn today with Her Majesty The Queen, we offer our condolences to her and to all her family, and we give thanks, as a nation and a Kingdom, for the extraordinary life and work of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh." Tributes also came pouring in from world leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. "On behalf of all the people of the United States, we send our deepest condolences to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the entire Royal Family, and all the people of the United Kingdom," Biden said in a statement. "Jill and I are keeping the Queen and to Prince Philip's children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren in our hearts during this time." Putin wished the queen " courage and spiritual fortitude in the face of a heavy and irreparable loss." The duke, who popularized the sobriquet "The Firm" for Windsor family business, ended his official duties in the fall of 2017. Months earlier, in June, he was hospitalized for an infection and missed the Queen's Speech opening the newly elected Parliament that month. Two days after missing Easter 2018 services  at St. George's Chapel, he was admitted to King Edward VII Hospital for previously scheduled hip replacement surgery, the palace said. That 10-day hospitalization came weeks before the birth of Prince William and Kate 's third child, Prince Louis Arthur, and the marriage of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle on May 19, 2018, at St. George's . In January 2019, Philip was uninjured after he was involved in a collision while driving a Land Rover — at age 97 — near the queen's Sandringham estate. The vehicle overturned , according to witnesses, and two women were treated for injuries. Weeks later, he decided to turn in his driver's license . During the coronavirus pandemic, Philip and Elizabeth had been staying at Windsor Castle, west of London. The Duke of Edinburgh supported his wife throughout an unprecedented time of social, economic, technological, political change and family crises. Fourteen prime ministers held office while Philip was British consort — companion to the sovereign — from Winston Churchill in 1952 through Johnson. Both the duke and the queen, the world's longest-reigning monarch, witnessed the transformation of a once-global British Empire into a Commonwealth of 52 independent member states, a free association headed by the queen. Philip's public statements had been few and far between in recent years and, even rarer were his direct dealings with the media. Previously, the duke was renowned for speaking his mind at public engagements, many times with cringe-worthy remarks that bent the bounds of humor. During the 1981 recession, for example, he said: "Everybody was saying we must have more leisure. Now they are complaining they are unemployed." "Aren't most of you descended from pirates?" Philip asked a wealthy resident of the Cayman Islands in 1994. "You're too fat to be an astronaut," he told a 13-year-old boy in 2001. When meeting in 2012 with a mayor who used a mobility scooter, Philip asked him: "Have you run over anybody?" Philip was born June 10, 1921, on the Greek island of Corfu as the youngest child and only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg. Andrew, whose father, King George I of Greece, was assassinated in 1913, was a commander in the Greek army during the 1919-1922 war with Turkey. With Greece's defeat, Andrew and the family were exiled in 1922, settling in France. Philip's maternal grandfather, Prince Louis of Battenberg, renounced his German titles, adopted the surname Mountbatten, an Anglicized version of the German Battenberg, and became a British citizen. At age 7 in 1928, Philip was sent to school in England. He lived with his maternal grandmother, Victoria Mountbatten, and his uncle George Mountbatten. Philip's four sisters married German aristocrats, and three of them — Sophie, Cecilie and Margarita — joined the Nazi party . To be sure, one of his brothers-in-law was among those implicated in the 1944 plot to kill Adolf Hitler. In an interview with historian Jonathan Petropoulos published in his 2006 book "Royals and the Reich," Philip stressed that he was never "conscious of anybody in the family actually expressing anti-Semitic views," but he acknowledged there were "inhibitions about the Jews" and "jealousy of their success." As a teenager, Philip joined the Royal Navy and went on to serve in World War II, including participating in the battles of Cape Matapan and Crete and the invasion of Sicily. He was in Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender on Sept. 2, 1945, and would later receive the Greek War Cross of Valor for his services in the Navy. In 1947, the 26-year-old Philip married his third cousin, Princess Elizabeth, 21, and in doing so, renounced his Greek title to become a naturalized British subject. He was later made Duke of Edinburgh by Elizabeth's father, King George VI. The royal matrimony at that time was not without controversy since Philip was not a native son. The Queen Mother reportedly referred to him as "the Hun." Nevertheless, the couple married in Westminster Abbey and received more than 2,500 wedding gifts from around the world. One year later, son and heir to the throne Charles was born, followed by Anne, Andrew and Edward. Philip's naval career, which had seen the newly married couple stationed in Malta for a short period, subsequently ended when George VI died Feb. 6, 1952, and Princess Elizabeth became queen. The duke assumed his new role as consort, accompanying Her Majesty around the world on domestic trips, state visits and Commonwealth tours. Elizabeth was formally crowned queen in 1953 in the first live television coronation to be broadcast globally. Shortly thereafter, Philip and Elizabeth embarked upon a seven-month international tour, visiting 13 countries and logging over 40,000 miles. Alongside his royal commitments, the duke became a qualified pilot and regularly played polo until his 50th birthday. Philip achieved many flying qualifications that would see him receive his Royal Air Force wings in 1953, helicopter wings two years later and private pilot's license in 1959. In an official capacity, Philip traveled to more than 140 countries. "The great thing about my father is that nobody's ever forgotten meeting him, so they've all got their stories," Prince Edward , the Earl of Wessex, said during an engagement at Windsor Castle in May 2017. "Wherever he's been, wherever in the world — people remember him. You can't really get a better accolade than that," he added. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip's reign also had to endure times of crises, including the British monarch being shot at with blanks in 1981. Two years earlier, the queen's art advisor, Anthony Blunt, was revealed to be a Communist spy, and Philip's uncle, Louis "Dickie" Lord Mountbatten, was killed by an Irish Republican Army bomb. In 1992, the marriages of three of their children collapsed. Andrew and Anne divorced from their spouses and Charles and Diana began a separation that ended in divorce four years later. Also in 1992, fire gutted Windsor Castle, one of the couple's official residences. The queen described this 12-month period as an "annus horribilis." During Charles and Diana's troubles, Philip reportedly counseled the couple to reconcile, but to no avail. A year after the 1996 divorce, Diana and her boyfriend Dodi Fayed were killed in a Paris car crash as photographers were chasing their limousine. Before the funeral, Philip successfully encouraged his 15-year-old grandson, William, to walk behind Diana's casket. Sixty years earlier, the then-16-year-old Philip marched behind the casket of his sister Cecilie after she was killed in a plane crash. "If you don't walk, I think you'll regret it later," Philip told William, according to British media accounts. "If I walk, will you walk with me?" Fayed's father claimed that Philip had ordered the couple executed, but in 2008, a London coroner rejected Mohamed al Fayed's conspiracy allegations , ruling there was no such evidence. The jury eventually decided that the crash resulted from grossly negligent driving by the couple's chauffeur and the pursuit of their limousine by paparazzi. In the decades following his marriage to the queen, the Duke of Edinburgh had taken up more than 22,000 solo engagements, 637 overseas visits, delivered an estimated 5,493 speeches and worked as a patron to almost 800 organizations, according to the royal website . One of his most successful associations has arguably been the creation of the Duke of Edinburgh Award, a youth self-improvement program that has been running for 65 years. In May 2017, the palace announced that the then-95-year-old prince would permanently discontinue his royal duties as of the fall. Philip and his wife had gradually passed on some of their respective workload in recent years. Their son and heir, Prince Charles, as well as grandsons, Princes William and Harry and other family members assumed more collective responsibility until Andrew was effectively stripped of his royal duties in 2019 because of his association with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Harry stepped back as a senior royal in 2020. The queen said in tribute to her husband on their golden wedding anniversary on Nov. 20, 1997, "Quite simply, (he has) been my strength and stay all these years, and I and his whole family, in this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim or we shall ever know." The couple celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary in November 2017. During their private celebration at Windsor Castle, Elizabeth presented him with the Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order for "services to the sovereign." Survivors include his wife, Queen Elizabeth II, and their children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal ; Prince Andrew, Duke of York ; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. The queen and Philip also had eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren, including Augustus Philip Hawke Brooksbank, who was born Feb. 9 to Princess Eugenie and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, and is is named in part to honor the Duke of Edinburgh. "This is obviously a very sad day for Her Majesty, the Royal Family and the whole country," Sir Lindsay Hoyle, speaker of the House of Commons, said in a statement. "The Duke of Edinburgh has given his unwavering support to The Queen, both as a husband and as a consort. Described by Her Majesty as 'my constant strength', he served this country too, first with distinction during the Second World War and selflessly throughout eight decades during peacetime. ... "He will be remembered for his loyal devotion to service and his leadership of hundreds of ideals and causes close to his heart. Most notably, of course, is the Duke of Edinburgh's Award which helps millions of young people around the world to achieve their full potential as team members and future leaders in their chosen fields." In a statement lamenting Philp's passing, the charity said it has aided 6.7 million young people in the U.K. alone in the 65 years since he founded it. — CNBC's Marty Steinberg is based in New Jersey.
Cameron, who led the U.K. from 2010 to 2016, reportedly sent text messages about Greensill to ministers including Finance Minister Rishi Sunak. The investigation will be led by legal expert Nigel Boardman. Cameron began working as an adviser to Greensill in August 2018.	LONDON — The U.K. government on Monday announced plans to open an independent investigation into Greensill Capital following former Prime Minister David Cameron's efforts to lobby ministers on behalf of the financial firm. "The Cabinet Office is commissioning an independent review on behalf of the prime minister to establish the development and use of supply chain finance and associated activities in government and the role Greensill played in those," Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesperson told reporters, according to Reuters. "This independent review will also look at how contracts were secured and business representatives engaged with government," he said, adding the prime minister wanted it to be concluded promptly. The investigation will be led by legal expert Nigel Boardman, a former partner at Slaughter and May law firm and a non-executive director at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Greensill, which fell into administration last month, claims on its website that it "unlocks finance so the world can put it to work" and in 2020, it issued over $143 billion in finance to over 10 million customers. The London-headquartered firm, in which Japan's SoftBank invested around $1.5 billion, filed for administration after its insurance provider refused to renew $4.6 billion of insurance for its loans. Its collapse has put tens of thousands of steelmaking jobs at risk in the U.K. In 2010, Cameron promised to tackle "secret corporate lobbying," warning it could become the next political scandal. Cameron, who led the U.K. from 2010 to 2016, sent text messages about Greensill to ministers including Finance Minister Rishi Sunak, according to a response to a freedom of information request . Sunak confirmed on Friday that Cameron contacted him informally by phone, saying that the matter was passed on to the appropriate officials. Greensill reportedly wanted a government loan scheme to be changed or expanded in scope so that it could access cheap loans from the Treasury. Sunak added that it was right that the "Treasury listened to — and gave due consideration to — all potential options to support businesses to survive the pandemic." Cameron and Greensill founder Lex Greensill also met Health Secretary Matt Hancock to discuss a payment scheme for the NHS, according to a report from The Sunday Times newspaper . Cameron began working as an adviser to Greensill after leaving office in August 2018. The former Conservative Party leader has denied that he broke any rules over the matter nor any code of conduct. In his first comments in weeks over the scandal, Cameron on Sunday conceded that he should have contacted government ministers through formal channels, saying there were "important lessons to be learnt." Cameron said he had been trying to get money for Greensill through a government-backed emergency loans scheme that was set up to help firms affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The government declined to support Greensill through its "Covid Corporate Financing Facility."
The U.K. has eased its lockdown further with the reopening of non-essential shops and pub beer gardens on Monday. A number of pubs with 24-hour licenses opened as soon as they were allowed: at one minute past midnight. The U.K. aims to lift all social restrictions on June 21.	LONDON — The U.K. has eased its lockdown further with the reopening of non-essential shops and perhaps the most keenly-missed social hotspot — pubs — able to welcome customers to their gardens again on Monday. Hairdressers, beauty and nail salons and indoor leisure facilities such as gyms and spas are now allowed to reopen and overnight stays away from home in England are now permitted. International travel remains illegal, however, unless for essential reasons. Public buildings such as libraries and community centers will also reopen, as will outdoor attractions including zoos and theme parks. Still, the reopening of pub gardens as the weather improves is expected to give a much-needed morale boost to the British public and the hospitality sector. It comes after a tumultuous year that has seen pubs, bars and restaurants closed for much of the last 12 months. A number of pubs with 24-hour licenses opened as soon as they were allowed. The Kentish Belle, a micropub in London, for instance, opened at 1 minute past midnight on Monday. Meanwhile, The Switch bar in Newcastle did the same and was fully booked, despite temperatures dropping below freezing. Regular pubs across the country have been fully booked for weeks as drinkers counted down to April 12. Punters will be required to sit outside until further measures are eased in the coming months. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed last week that an analysis of the Covid infection data following the reopening of schools meant that the country's reopening plan, or "roadmap," could continue. The government has based its decisions on lifting the lockdown on four factors: that the vaccine deployment program continues successfully, that evidence shows vaccines are reducing hospitalizations and deaths and that there is no surge in hospitalizations. In addition, it said its assessment would look at the risks posed by new variants of the virus. Johnson said last week that there was currently "nothing in the present data" to deviate from the roadmap, allowing "Step 2" of the easing to take place on April 12. Johnson urged caution, however, saying that many restrictions remained in place; outdoor gatherings must still be limited to 6 people or 2 households, for example, and people cannot socialize indoors with anyone they do not live with or have not formed a support bubble with. The U.K. was hit particularly badly by the coronavirus. To date, over 4.3 million infections have been reported in the U.K. and over 127,000 people have died. One silver lining has been the country's vaccination program which has been one of the fastest and successful in the world so far. To date, over  32 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and over 7.4 million have received a second dose. The swiftness of the rollout, which began in December ahead of the U.S. and EU, largely enabled the country to overcome a third wave of cases in late 2020 that was attributed to the spread of a more infectious variant of the virus. The next easing of lockdown is due on May 17, when most mixing rules will be lifted outdoors, with a limit of 30 people. Indoor mixing will also be allowed for up to six people and indoor parts of pubs and restaurants, cinemas, museums and group exercise classes will reopen. The government looking to completely lift all restrictions on social contact on June 21.
The race has just become even more complicated, with two rivals contesting the conservative ticket. CDU lawmakers will discuss who that should be on Tuesday and hope to come to a decision this week. But it will be a difficult choice between their party leader and someone as popular as Soeder. The CDU/CSU are polling about 27%, but are closely followed by the Green party, which currently has about 21% of the public support and has been going up in recent surveys.	LONDON — It was never going to be easy to find a successor to Angela Merkel, German chancellor for the last 16 years. But the race has just become even more complicated, with two rivals contesting the conservative ticket. The obvious conservative candidate in the upcoming German election would be Armin Laschet, head of the North Rhine-Westphalia state. He was elected leader of Merkel's CDU party in January and claims he wants to modernize Germany. That was until Markus Soeder, from the Bavarian sister party, the CSU, threw his hat in the ring. Soeder is arguably the most popular man in German politics. "It has always been clear that the race to Angela Merkel's succession will be long and will not follow a straight line. It might not be a blockbuster movie but rather a binge-viewing-worthy political series," Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, said in a note on Tuesday. When it comes to federal elections, the CDU and CSU act together — and so will only field one candidate. CDU lawmakers will discuss who that should be on Tuesday and hope to come to a decision this week. But it will be a difficult choice between their party leader and someone as popular as Soeder. Elisabeth Motschmann, a lawmaker for the CDU, told CNBC's Squawk Box Europe on Tuesday that she supports Soeder. "For this very hard job, I think that Markus Soeder will do his best and is able to win," she said. "I don't think that (Laschet) would be hard enough and he can't decide like Soeder." Jens Suedekum, professor at Dusseldorf Institute for Competition Economics, told CNBC via email that, "what characterizes Soeder is his unique degree of flexibility, you may call it opportunism, when it comes to political principles." Germany's conservative party has seen its popularity fall since January, when the coronavirus pandemic began to worsen in the country. It is finally set to harmonize lockdown rules in an effort to contain a third wave of cases. This comes after the population expressed frustration at how the rules have differed from region to region ever since the initial outbreak of the Covid-19 . But things could be about to look up for the conservatives. "Once the CDU/CSU's official election campaign starts in full force and vaccinations ramp up, things will look better for them," Naz Masraff, director at consultancy firm Eurasia Group, said in a note on Tuesday. However, she stressed that Laschet would likely have a more difficult time consolidating the CDU/CSU's voter base and winning back centrist voters from the Green party. "He will also have to work hard to change his image as a weak and equivocating leader who hasn't taken as strong a line on the pandemic, or on corruption in the party's ranks, as many Germans expected," Masraff added. Whoever the CDU chooses to be its running candidate could ultimately have an impact on what kind of coalition will emerge in September. "Laschet's candidacy would benefit the Greens and the Social Democrats. It would also increase the chances of a Green chancellor after September's elections," Masraff said. The CDU/CSU are currently in the lead in the polls, with around 27% of the vote; the Greens, however, are gaining ground with around 21%. The party with the most votes will lead coalition negotiations after the September election. Christian Schulz, chief economist at Citi, told CNBC's Squawk Box Europe on Tuesday that as the September election approaches, investors will be looking at what the new government could mean for fiscal policy in the euro area. He said that both conservative candidates "say very little about what they want to do," but added: "Soeder gets across has having more Eurosceptic instincts, so he would probably be the worst outcome for markets at least in the short term." The yield on the 10-year German bond has risen since Soeder's announcement on Sunday, indicating some concerns over political uncertainty.
An 81-page leaked document says "indiscriminate surveillance of natural persons should be prohibited when applied in a generalized manner to all persons without differentiation." On social credit scoring, which is already used in China, the draft legislation says: "AI systems used for general purpose social scoring" should be prohibited. Certain uses of "high-risk" AI could be banned altogether, according to the document, while others might not be able to enter the bloc if they fail to meet certain standards.	LONDON — Using artificial intelligence software for mass surveillance and ranking social behavior could soon be outlawed in Europe, according to draft legislation that has been shared online . The 81-page document, which was first reported by Politico , says "indiscriminate surveillance of natural persons should be prohibited when applied in a generalized manner to all persons without differentiation." It adds the methods of surveillance could include monitoring and tracking of people in digital and physical environments. On social credit scoring, which is already used in China to stop people traveling if they commit "social misdeeds,"  the draft legislation says: "AI systems used for general purpose social scoring" should be prohibited. While China is able to keep tabs on its citizens with its credit scoring system, some academics argue it is too intrusive and could lead to the government taking overt control over people's lives. Certain uses of "high-risk" AI in Europe could be banned altogether, according to the document, while others might not be able to enter the bloc if they fail to meet certain standards. A European Commission spokesperson told CNBC: "The Commission is set to adopt the regulatory framework on AI next Wednesday 21 April 2021. Any text that you might see before is therefore by definition not 'legitimate' – we do not comment on leaks." AI systems deemed to be high-risk should be inspected if they are going to be deployed and the creators of the system may have to show that it was trained on unbiased datasets in a traceable way and with human oversight. Companies developing AI in and outside the EU could reportedly be fined 20 million euros ($24 million) or 4% of global revenue if they breach the yet to be introduced laws. The proposals are set to be formally announced next week by the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, and they're subject to change until such a time. They will need to be voted on before they're introduced. The European Commission is trying to find the right balance between supporting innovation and ensuring AI benefits its 500 million plus inhabitants. If the proposals are adopted then Europe could set itself apart from the U.S. and China, which are yet to introduce any serious AI regulation. Omer Tene, vice president of nonprofit the International Association of Privacy Professionals, said via Twitter that the legislation "represents the typical Brussels approach to new tech and innovation. When in doubt, regulate." Samim Winiger, an AI researcher in Berlin, Germany told CNBC that the EU is "far behind" China and the U.S. in the AI race. "I find it rather difficult to understand how the introduction of highly complex, highbrow AI regulations in a niche market, will have any real impact on the development of 'AI' globally," he said.
The EU agreed in July to tap financial markets in search of 750 billion euros ($898 billion) to distribute across the 27 nations and prop up their economies after the coronavirus shock. However, in order to receive these funds, countries have had to detail how they will be using them — a process that has not yet concluded.	LONDON — Austria's finance chief believes there is no need for concern over the EU's recovery funds, with investors growing increasingly wary about a delay in the much-needed post-pandemic cash. The EU agreed in July to tap financial markets in search of 750 billion euros ($898 billion) to distribute across the 27 nations and prop up their economies after the coronavirus shock. However, in order to receive these funds, countries have had to detail how they will be using them — a process that has not yet concluded. In addition, the German constitutional court threw a curveball at the process. Last month, it raised doubts about it and effectively halted the necessary legislative steps in Germany, before the funds could be released. "We of course have followed quite closely the developments by the court ruling in Germany. To a certain extent they are stipulating what many critics say that there is a danger to implementing temporary measures in a permanent way," Gernot BlümeI, the finance minister of Austria, told CNBC on Friday. The German court acted after a group called the Citizens' Will Alliance complained that the EU treaties did not allow the bloc to take on debt jointly. The German judges said that the federal government should ensure that borrowing at the EU level "does not become a permanent solution" — an opinion shared by Austria. "I can understand what the German court said and in some parts I agree," he said, adding that Austria is "a little bit more skeptical when it comes to a permanent mutualization of debts within the European Union" in comparison with France and Germany. "That's not what the Union was designed for. And we have now taken crisis combatting measures. But per (its) definition a crisis is a temporary situation, so the measures that we have put up to fight this crisis have also a temporary motive," BlümeI told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" Friday. There is another element needed before the funds can be released: All EU member states need to conclude the ratification process in their national parliaments. Austria is among the 10 EU nations that is yet to do that and without this, the EU cannot tap the debt markets. "I am convinced there will be no delay to be able to also emit those European bonds because it is an important measure to re-boost the European economy," Austria's finance chief said when asked why his country had not taken this step yet. "We have agreed on those measures, Austria is paying a big share of 12 billion euros into this pot and we do this because we think it is the right way to increase growth within the European market because all citizens of Europe will benefit from it," he added. Austria, just like other EU nations, has struggled to rapidly roll out Covid-19 vaccines to its citizens. But Chancellor Sebastian Kurz confirmed last weekend that negotiations to buy the Russian Sputnik V vaccine had concluded, even though this shot has not yet been approved by the European Medicines Agency. BlümeI said that Austria had followed the rules and "tried to get more doses for vaccination, just to be quicker in recovering the economy and giving the people back their freedom." "I can't see anything wrong in doing so," he said. A few eastern EU nations, such as Hungary, have decided to go beyond the deals negotiated by the European Commission to purchase more vaccines themselves, even if these haven't received medical approval across the bloc. Speaking to CNBC, BlümeI said he is optimistic that in the next two to three months, Austria will have vaccinated all of its adult population who wish to receive a vaccine.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday that Moscow will order 10 U.S. diplomats to leave Russia in a retaliatory response to the U.S. sanctions. Lavrov also said that Moscow will add eight U.S. officials to its sanctions list and move to restrict and stop the activities of U.S. nongovernment organizations from interfering in Russia's politics. The moves follow a barrage of new sanctions on Russia announced this week by the Biden administration.	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday that Moscow will order 10 U.S. diplomats to leave Russia in a retaliatory response to the U.S. sanctions. Lavrov also said that Moscow will add eight U.S. officials to its sanctions list and move to restrict and stop the activities of U.S. nongovernment organizations from interfering in Russia's politics. He added that while Russia has a possibility to take "painful measures" against the American business in Russia, it wouldn't immediately move to do that The moves follow a barrage of new sanctions on Russia announced this week by the Biden administration. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. Hit by a barrage of new sanctions this week from the Biden administration, the Kremlin is carefully weighing its response in a tense showdown with the United States. While the U.S. wields the power to cripple the Russian economy, Moscow lacks levers to respond in kind, although it potentially could hurt American interests in many other ways around the globe. Despite its heated rhetoric, Moscow will likely refrain from raising the stakes too high, for now, to avoid provoking even harder-hitting punitive measures from the U.S. But some observers predict that Russia and China will quickly edge closer to coordinate their policies amid the growing U.S. pressure. Russia has denied interfering in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and involvement in the SolarWind hack of federal agencies — the activities punished by the latest U.S. sanctions. The Russian Foreign Ministry warned of an "inevitable" retaliation, charging that "Washington should realize that it will have to pay a price for the degradation of bilateral ties." The U.S. on Thursday ordered 10 Russian diplomats expelled, targeted dozens of companies and people, and imposed new curbs on Russia's ability to borrow money. Pundits predicted Moscow would almost certainly respond in kind to the expulsions but would refrain from any other significant moves to avoid a further escalation. President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, invited U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan on Friday to tell him about the Russian response, but the Kremlin wouldn't say what measures he announced. Russia's economic potential and its global reach are limited compared with the Soviet Union that competed with the U.S for international influence during the Cold War. Still, Russia's nuclear arsenal and its leverage in many parts of the world make it a power that Washington needs to reckon with. Aware of that, President Joe Biden called for de-escalating tensions and held the door open for cooperation with Russia in certain areas. Biden said he told Putin in Tuesday's call that he chose not to impose tougher sanctions for now and proposed to meet in a third country in the summer. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the summit offer was being analyzed. While the new U.S. sanctions further limited Russia's ability to borrow money by banning U.S. financial institutions from buying Russian government bonds directly from state institutions, they didn't target the secondary market. "It's very important that there're no sanctions on secondary debt because that means that non-U.S. persons can buy the debt and sell it to the U.S. persons," said Tom Adshead, director of research at Macro-Advisory Ltd, an analytics and advisory company. Tougher restrictions would also hurt Western businesses, inflict significant economic pain on the Russian population and allow Putin to rally anti-U.S. sentiments to shore up his rule. Ramping up sanctions could eventually drive Russia into a corner and provoke even more reckless Kremlin action, such as a potential escalation in Ukraine, which has recently faced a surge in clashes with Russia-backed separatists in the east and a massive Russian troops buildup across the border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Paris on Friday to discuss the tensions with French President Emmanuel Macron. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was to join them in a call later. Fyodor Lukyanov, a top foreign policy expert who leads the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, predicted Putin would likely accept Biden's invitation to join next week's call on climate change but could drag his feet on accepting the summit offer. "There is no way to make any deals," Lukyanov said. "There is a mutual antipathy and a total lack of trust."
Philip, who died April 9 at the age of 99 after 73 years of marriage, was being laid to rest in the Royal Vault at Windsor Castle after a funeral service steeped in military and royal tradition. Coronavirus restrictions mean that instead of the 800 mourners included in the longstanding plans for his funeral, there will be only 30 inside the castle's St. George's Chapel. His coffin emerged from the State Entrance of Windsor Castle as those taking part in the ceremonial procession for his funeral took their places.	Military bands played and Queen Elizabeth II joined a procession Saturday at Windsor Castle ahead of a funeral where her husband Prince Philip was being remembered as a man of "courage, fortitude and faith." The service was saluting both his service in the Royal Navy and his support for Britain's monarch over three quarters of a century. Philip, who died April 9 at the age of 99 after 73 years of marriage, was being laid to rest in the Royal Vault at Windsor Castle after a funeral service steeped in military and royal tradition — but also pared down and infused with his own personality. Coronavirus restrictions mean that instead of the 800 mourners included in the longstanding plans for his funeral, there will be only 30 inside the castle's St. George's Chapel, including the widowed queen, her four children and her eight grandchildren. His coffin emerged from the State Entrance of Windsor Castle as those taking part in the ceremonial procession for his funeral took their places. It was loaded on a specially adapted Land Rover, designed by Philip himself, for the eight-minute journey to St. George's Chapel. Senior military commanders lined up in front of the vehicle, with members of the royal family following behind. The queen rode in a state Bentley at the rear of the procession. The entire procession and funeral was taking place out of public view within the grounds of the castle, a 950-year-old royal residence 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of London. It will be shown live on television. Under spring sunshine, some locals stopped outside the castle to leave flowers on Saturday, but people largely heeded requests by police and the palace not to gather because of the coronavirus pandemic. Philip's coffin coffin was draped in his personal standard, and topped with his Royal Navy cap and sword and a wreath of flowers. The funeral will reflect Philip's military ties, both as a ceremonial commander of many units and as a veteran of war. More than 700 military personnel are taking part, including army bands, Royal Marine buglers and an honor guard drawn from across the armed forces. Those marching into place included soldiers of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery, who were firing a gun salute, Guards regiments in scarlet tunics and bearskin hats, Highlanders in kilts and sailors in white naval hats. Philip was deeply involved in the funeral planning, and aspects of it reflect his personality, including his love of the rugged Land Rover. Philip drove several versions of the four-wheel drive vehicle for decades until he was forced to give up his license at 97 after a crash. His body will be carried to the chapel on a modified Land Rover Defender that he designed himself. The children of Philip and the queen — heir to the throne Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward — will walk behind the hearse, while the 94-year-old queen will travel to the chapel in a Bentley car. Grandsons Prince William and Prince Harry will also walk behind the coffin, although not side by side. The brothers, whose relationship has been strained amid Harry's decision to quit royal duties and move to California, will flank their cousin Peter Phillips, the son of Princess Anne. The moment is likely to stir memories of the image of William and Harry at 15 and 12, walking behind their mother Princess Diana's coffin in 1997, accompanied by their grandfather Philip, in a London ceremony televised around the world. Armed forces bands played hymns and classical music before the funeral service, which was being preceded by a nationwide minute of silence. Inside the Gothic chapel, the setting for centuries of royal weddings and funerals, the service was to be simple and somber. There will be no sermon, at Philip's request, and no family eulogies or readings, in keeping with royal tradition. But Dean of Windsor David Conner will say the country has been enriched by Philip's "unwavering loyalty to our queen, by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith." Philip spent almost 14 years in the Royal Navy and saw action in the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific during World War II. Several elements of his funeral have a maritime theme, including the hymn "Eternal Father, Strong to Save," which is associated with seafarers and asks God: "O hear us when we cry to thee/For those in peril on the sea." As Philip's coffin is lowered into the Royal Vault, Royal Marine buglers will sound "Action Stations," an alarm that alerts sailors to prepare for battle — a personal request from Philip. Former Bishop of London Richard Chartres, who knew Philip well, said the prince was a man of faith , but liked things kept succinct. "He was at home with broad church, high church and low church, but what he really liked was short church," Chartres told the BBC. "I always remember preaching on occasions which he was principal actor that the instruction would always come down: 'No more than four minutes.'" Along with Philip's children and grandchildren, the 30 funeral guests include other senior royals and several of his German relatives. Philip was born a prince of Greece and Denmark and, like the queen, is related to a thicket of European royal families . Mourners have been instructed to wear masks and observe social distancing inside the chapel, and not to join in when a four-person choir sings hymns. The queen, who has spent much of the past year isolating with her husband at Windsor Castle, will sit alone. Ahead of the funeral, Buckingham Palace released a photo of the queen and Philip, smiling and relaxing on blankets in the grass in the Scottish Highlands in 2003. The palace said the casual photo was a favorite of the queen. For decades, Philip was a fixture of British life, renowned for his founding of the Duke of Edinburgh's Awards youth program and for a blunt-spoken manner that at times included downright offensive remarks. He lived in his wife's shadow, but his death has sparked a reflection about his role, and new appreciation from many in Britain. "He was a character, an absolute character," said Jenny Jeeves as she looked at the floral tributes in Windsor. "He was fun, he was funny. Yes, he made quite a few gaffes, but it depends which way you took it really. Just a wonderful husband, father, and grandfather, and a good example to all of us, really."
Twelve of Europe's leading football clubs have agreed to establish a Super League, despite widespread criticism of the plans. They include AC Milan, Chelsea, Barcelona, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Real Madrid. The project is being launched to rival UEFA's Champions League format which currently dominates European football and it comes as UEFA was due to sign off on plans for an expanded and restructured Champions League on Monday.	Twelve of Europe's leading football clubs have agreed to establish a Super League, despite widespread criticism of the plans. A statement from the new competition said: "AC Milan, Arsenal, Atlético Madrid, Chelsea, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur have all joined as founding clubs. "It is anticipated that a further three clubs will join ahead of the inaugural season, which is intended to commence as soon as practicable." Florentino Pérez, president of Real Madrid and the first chairman of the Super League, said: "We will help football at every level and take it to its rightful place in the world. Football is the only global sport in the world with more than four billion fans and our responsibility as big clubs is to respond to their desires." The project is being launched to rival UEFA's Champions League format which currently dominates European football and it comes as UEFA was due to sign off on plans for an expanded and restructured Champions League on Monday. The new Super League has been criticized by politicians , such as Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer, as well as former players such as Gary Neville. Mr Johnson said the new league would "strike at the heart of the domestic game, and will concern fans across the country." He added: "The clubs involved must answer to their fans and the wider footballing community before taking any further steps." Sir Keir said the plans had ignored the fans, adding: "Football in empty stadiums hasn't been the same over the last year. I can't wait to get back to games. But this proposal risks shutting the door on fans for good, reducing them to mere spectators and consumers. "The clubs involved in this proposal should rethink immediately. And if they don't, they should face the consequences of their actions. Because football without fans is nothing." Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville told Sky Sports: "I'm not against the modernisation of football competitions, we have the Premier League, the Champions League, but I think to bring forward proposals in the midst of COVID and the economic crisis for all clubs is an absolute scandal. "United and the rest of the 'Big Six' that have signed up to it against the rest of the Premier League should be ashamed of themselves." Neville added: " They should deduct six points off all six teams that have signed up to it . Deduct points off them all. To do it during a season? It's a joke." UEFA, the FA, and the Premier League are among others to have expressed opposition, saying in a joint statement that they "remain united in our efforts to stop this cynical project", adding: "We thank those clubs in other countries, especially the French and German clubs, who have refused to sign up to this. "This persistent self-interest of a few has been going on for too long. Enough is enough." The English FA said: "We would not provide permission to any competition that would be damaging to English football, and will take any legal and/or regulatory action necessary to protect the broader interests of the game." The Super League competition will see 20 participating clubs - 15 founding clubs and a further five teams able to qualify annually based on their achievements during the previous season. It will begin in August with clubs participating in two groups of 10, playing home and away fixtures, some during the week, with the top three in each group qualifying for the quarter-finals. Teams finishing fourth and fifth will compete in a two-legged play-off for the remaining quarter-final spots before a knockout format is used to reach the final at the end of May, which will be staged as a single fixture at a neutral venue. Club players will be able to continue competing in their national leagues and, as soon as possible after the men's competition begins, a women's league will also be launched.
The Greens' popularity has risen in recent years and the polls now have them as only a few percentage points behind Merkel's CDU party, as more and more voters turn to climate-related topics. Baerbock and Robert Habeck, co-leaders of the party, seem to have united and disciplined members like no other leadership team has done before. And the new goal is not only to be part of the government, but perhaps even enter the chancellery later this year.	Annalena Baerbock has been selected as the Green Party candidate to be the next German chancellor, as the country gears up for elections this year where Angela Merkel will exit the political stage. The Greens' popularity has risen in recent years and the polls now have them as only a few percentage points behind Merkel's CDU party, as more and more voters turn to climate-related topics. Baerbock and Robert Habeck, co-leaders of the party, seem to have united and disciplined members like no other leadership team has done before. And the new goal is not only to be part of the government, but perhaps even enter the chancellery later this year. The advent of the Green Party has coincided with its professionalization. It started off as a protest movement and an opposition party. It was divided into a left and a more conservative wing for many years. While that hasn't changed completely, the party is now a true middle-class platform. Baerbock was born in 1980 close to Hannover. She graduated from the London School of Economics in 2005 with a Master's in Public International Law. She's been a member of the party since 2005 and a member of the Bundestag since 2013. During her political career she has served in various roles: She was spokesperson for climate change of the Green Parliamentary Group between 2013 and 2017 and a deputy member of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Energy. Some commentators liken her style and analytical approach to that of current German leader Merkel. The Greens want to restructure the economic model of Germany into a social-ecological system. What does that mean? Clearly the focus is on pushing green technologies, exiting coal energy by 2030 and banning cars with combustion engines from German roads by 2030. That's ambitious given that it's only nine years away. German industry is already ringing the alarm bells: "The Greens want a different society," said the BDI in a statement on March 19. "The restructuring of the society will be very expensive for the economy and the society itself, we would need a much more growth friendly policy approach after the pandemic for Germany." But the Greens are no longer a party full of radicals, they have a plan in mind to finance their program. While the party program calls for the relaxation of the so-called debt brake which would enable Germany to raise more money on public markets, they also call for higher taxes on the wealthy. On top of that, they are pushing for a 500 billion euro fund over 10 years to finance this climate transition. "This is clever political marketing directed at liberal middle-class voters," said Carsten Nickel of Teneo in a note last month. The key question is which role the Greens will play in the next government, with elections due in September. It only has an outside chance it will enter the chancellery, but it's not completely impossible. If the CDU fails to gain a majority alongside another party, including the Greens, then a possible SPD, Left and Green coalition could form in Berlin. And in that case, the next chancellor could well be Baerbock.
The Russian state penitentiary service said Monday a decision has been made to transfer imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is in the third week of a hunger strike, to a hospital. The announcement comes two days after Navalny's physician said his health was deteriorating rapidly and the 44-year-old Kremlin critic could be on the verge of death.	The Russian state penitentiary service said Monday a decision has been made to transfer imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is in the third week of a hunger strike, to a hospital. The announcement comes two days after Navalny's physician said his health was deteriorating rapidly and the 44-year-old Kremlin critic could be on the verge of death. The state prison service, FSIN, said in a statement that Navalny would be transferred to a hospital for convicts located in another penal colony in Vladimir, a city 180 kilometers (110 miles) east of Moscow. According to the statement, Navalny's condition is deemed "satisfactory" and he has agreed to take vitamin therapy. Navalny's physician, Dr. Yaroslav Ashikhmin, said Saturday that test results he received from Navalny's family show him with sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, and heightened creatinine levels that indicate impaired kidneys. "Our patient could die at any moment," he said in a Facebook post. Navalny went on hunger strike to protest the refusal to let his doctors visit when he began experiencing severe back pain and a loss of feeling in his legs. Russia's state penitentiary service has said that Navalny was receiving all the medical help he needs. In response to the alarming news about Navalny's health this weekend, his allies have called for a nationwide rally on Wednesday, the same day that President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to deliver his annual state of the nation address. Navalny, Putin's fiercest opponent, was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin — accusations Russian officials have rejected. Navalny's arrest triggered a massive wave of protests all across Russia, the biggest show of defiance in recent years. Soon after the arrest, a court ordered Navalny to serve 2 1/2 years in prison on a 2014 embezzlement conviction he said was fabricated and the European Court of Human Rights deemed to be "arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable." Last month, the politician was transferred to a penal colony east of Moscow, notorious for its harsh conditions. Navalny has complained about being sleep-deprived due to guards conducting hourly checks on him at night, and said he has developed severe back pain and numbness in his legs within weeks of being transferred to the colony. His demands for a visit from an independent "civilian" physician were rebuffed by prison officials, and he went on hunger strike on March 31. In a message from prison on Friday, Navalny said prison officials threatened to force-feed him "imminently," using "straitjacket and other pleasures."
Germany's political establishment has been in a state of flux for several years, arguably since Chancellor Angela Merkel announced in 2018 that she would not run for a fifth term in office. Since then, new political trends have emerged in the country. The Green Party is a beneficiary of new voter trends.	Germany's political establishment has been in a state of flux ever since Chancellor Angela Merkel announced in 2018 that she would not run for a fifth term in office. Since then, amid constant speculation over who will be the next leader of Germany, new political trends have emerged in Europe's largest and most influential economy. The Green Party, for instance, has grown in popularity among liberal, middle-class voters, benefitting from a shift in voters away from the political mainstream, and a more environmentally-conscious electorate. Recent voter polls and several state elections show that support for the Greens has risen to such an extent that it could become instrumental in forming the next government after a national election in September. Four polls conducted in mid-April in Germany put support for the party between 20-22%, making the Green Party the second most popular party after Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU alliance. This center-right political group, made up of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, has been dominant in German politics for years. But support for the alliance came in around 28-31% in the same polls this month. Germany's political direction could become clearer this week as the Greens and CDU/CSU announce which candidates they will put forward to run for chancellor. On Monday, the Green Party confirmed that Annalena Baerbock will be its candidate for the next German chancellor . Jürgen Trittin, member of the Bundestag and former leader of Germany's Green Party, told CNBC that Baerbock's candidacy was a "historic decision" and a new chapter for the party. "Now, for the first time, this (election) race takes place between the Green Party on one side and the conservatives on the right side," he said. Trittin said he  believed Baerbock would be supported broadly by the party as whole. The CDU/CSU is also expected to announce this week who it will field in the September 26 vote , but it's unclear whether CDU leader Armin Laschet and CSU leader Markus Söder will lead the conservatives into the next election. Berenberg Bank's Chief Economist Holger Schmieding on Monday put the chance that the CDU/CSU will lead the next German government at 65%, with the Greens as junior partner (a 95% probability). However, the Schmieding also said there was a 35% chance that the Greens could form a government without the CDU/CSU. It could instead form a coalition with the Social Democratic Party (the SPD, currently a junior coalition partner with the CDU/CSU) and with either the liberal FDP or the Left Party as a third partner. "Only a 'green-red-red' coalition between the Greens, the SPD and the left-wing Left Party would herald a major shift in German policies, notably towards tighter labour, housing and product markets regulations that would reduce German trend growth," Schmieding noted Monday. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank's macro strategy team said in a note Monday that, "it's no longer implausible that the next German chancellor could come from the Greens following September's federal election." Nonetheless, the bank still sees a CDU/CSU-Green coalition as its baseline scenario, as it expects the conservative alliance to regain polling momentum. Speaking to CNBC Monday, Berenberg's Schmieding said a power vacuum caused by Merkel's departure was to be expected. "When an older leader goes, and Angela Merkel will not run again, there is a bit of a vacuum and it's right that we see some of that, to some extent, on the European level and, to a more significant extent, on the German level," he told CNBC's Squawk Box Europe.
Pfizer's vaccine, developed with German biotech BioNTech, is being widely rolled out in the region. Europe's Covid immunization programs have been slow to progress. RDIF's CEO said that negotiations over Russia's Sputnik V vaccine supplies had taken place with Germany "and several other countries" although he did not name these.	Europe should be open to taking up and using Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, according to Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, amid what he described as a "Pfizer monopoly" across the region. Dmitriev at RDIF, which backed the development of Russia's coronavirus vaccine, told CNBC that the vaccine could be useful to Europe where Covid immunization programs have been slow to progress. "It's very important that Europe is open to different vaccines because it's not good to have a Pfizer monopoly in Europe," Dmitriev told CNBC's "Street Signs Europe" on Monday. "It's good to have AstraZeneca , Johnson & Johnson , and other vaccines so that prices are reasonable and Europe is not subject to a vaccine monopoly that may be in the process of being created." Coronavirus vaccines developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, and the vaccine from Pfizer and German pharmaceutical firm BioNTech are currently the predominant shots being used in Europe. However, the former has been subject to investigations by the European Medicines Agency over concerns that it could be linked to a small number of rare but serious blood clotting incidents in post-vaccinated people. Similar concerns have impacted the Johnson & Johnson shot ( soon to be rolled out in the EU ) but following investigations, the EMA has deemed the benefits of both shots to outweigh the risks . There are now anecdotal reports of Europeans refusing the AstraZeneca shot, which is cheaper to produce and buy, and asking instead for the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. CNBC has contacted Pfizer for a response to Dmitriev's comments. In the meantime, a dispute has been brewing in the EU over the potential use of Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, which was initially the subject of doubts over its clinical data and safety standards and has more recently been seen as a geopolitical tool by Russia which has sold the vaccine to various countries around the world, mainly to its allies. Interim analysis of phase 3 clinical trials of the shot, involving 20,000 participants and published in the peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet in early February, found that it was 91.6% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 infection. The EMA is currently evaluating the clinical data ahead of a possible authorization of the shot which would pave the way for the vaccine to be used in the EU. Several countries in Eastern Europe have expressed an interest in, or have bought and deployed doses of the vaccine already, including Hungary, despite the fact that it has not yet been approved by the EMA. Such purchases have not been without controversy: Slovakia's drug agency, for example, claimed earlier in April that doses of Sputnik V that it received were not the same as those reviewed by international experts . Russia responded by demanding that Slovakia return hundreds of thousands of doses, citing contract violations, Reuters reported . RDIF's CEO said that negotiations over vaccine supplies had taken place with Germany "and several other countries" although he did not name these. France is also known to have had talks with Russia over possible purchases of the vaccine, however. Dmitriev said he hoped the EMA would have finished its evaluation of the shot by June. "We are very clear that we can provide 50 million doses of the vaccine ... from June to September, to Europe."
The notice was issued by Britain's Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden on Monday. It's not clear what the national security grounds are but the government said Dowden "considered advice received from officials across the investment security community."	LONDON — The U.K. government has intervened in Nvidia's proposed $40 billion takeover of chip designer Arm on national security grounds. Britain's Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden issued a Public Interest Intervention Notice (PIIN) on Monday. It's not clear what the national security grounds are but the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said Dowden "considered advice received from officials across the investment security community." Dowden said he has written to the U.K. competition watchdog and asked them to start a "phase one" investigation into the transaction, which was announced in September. The Competition and Markets Authority has been instructed to compile a report for Dowden on the competition and national security aspects of the deal before July 30. Dowden could then approve the deal, permit it on certain conditions, or ask for a more detailed inquiry. "Following careful consideration of the proposed takeover of Arm, I have today issued an intervention notice on national security grounds," said Dowden in a statement. "As a next step and to help me gather the relevant information, the U.K.'s independent competition authority will now prepare a report on the implications of the transaction, which will help inform any further decisions." He added: "We want to support our thriving UK tech industry and welcome foreign investment, but it is appropriate that we properly consider the national security implications of a transaction like this." A spokesperson for Nvidia said: "We do not believe that this transaction poses any material national security issues. We will continue to work closely with the British authorities, as we have done since the announcement of this deal." Arm is being sold by SoftBank, which acquired the firm for £24 billion ($33 billion) in 2016 without any major issues. The new sale, however, has raised concerns that Nvidia could relocate Arm's headquarters to the U.S. and reduce competition in the semiconductor industry. The ongoing global chip shortage has also highlighted how important semiconductors are in today's world. They're used in everything from smartphones and cars to fighter jets and other weapons systems. As a result, nations are keen to become more self-reliant when it comes to chip production, which is currently dominated by China. Set up in the 1980s, Arm licenses its chip designs to manufacturers around the world and it's been referred to as the "Switzerland" of the chip industry due to its neutrality. Chipmakers including Qualcomm have expressed concerns that Nvidia may look to close off access to Arm's technology, but Nvidia insists that such a move isn't planned. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has pledged to keep Arm's headquarters in Cambridge and expand the company's footprint in the city. The deal is also being probed by regulators in the U.S., China and the European Union and some question whether it will be allowed to go through. Five industry sources, including two tech investors , told CNBC in February that they think the deal has a very high chance of being blocked by one or more of the regulators.
Britain requires banks to "ring-fence" the retail arms of their operations to shield them from any problems in their riskier, investment banking arms. Proprietary trading refers to banks buying and selling stocks, bonds and other assets on their own account rather than on behalf of a client.	Britain on Tuesday launched an independent review of capital and proprietary trading rules introduced following the global financial crisis more than a decade ago as it seeks to bolster the City of London's global competitiveness after Brexit. Britain requires banks to "ring-fence" the retail arms of their operations to shield them from any problems in their riskier, investment banking arms. Proprietary trading refers to banks buying and selling stocks, bonds and other assets on their own account rather than on behalf of a client. "Over the last decade, UK banks have seen significant changes to the environment in which they operate, including the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK's exit from the EU, and wider changes in the UK financial sector," the independent review said. The review was called for by the finance ministry and the independent panel is chaired by City veteran Keith Skeoch. Britain's full departure from the European Union on Dec. 31 means it no longer has to comply with the bloc's financial rules, freeing it up to tailor regulation to UK lenders. "This review presents a unique opportunity to assess the observed impacts of the regulatory regimes, intended or otherwise, for financial stability, competition, competitiveness, and the balance between these in light of the changes in the UK financial sector and wider economy," the review said.
"Audiences are decreasing, and rights are decreasing and something had to be done. We are all ruined. Television has to change so we can adapt," Florentino Perez, chairman of the new European Super League, said. His comments come shortly after it was announced 12 of Europe's wealthiest soccer teams, including Real Madrid, had signed up as founding members of the ESL. The move has sparked outrage among lawmakers, governing bodies, former players, pundits and fans.	LONDON — The chairman of the European Super League has said plans to form a new breakaway elite competition are designed "to save" soccer, pushing back against widespread criticism by claiming that change is necessary because young people "are no longer interested" in the sport. In an interview with Spanish television show El Chiringuito de Jugones on Monday, Florentino Perez, who is also the president of Spanish club Real Madrid, said: "Whenever there is a change, there are always people who oppose it ... and we are doing this to save football at this critical moment." "Audiences are decreasing, and rights are decreasing and something had to be done. We are all ruined. Television has to change so we can adapt," he continued. "Young people are no longer interested in football. Why not? Because there are a lot of poor-quality games and they are not interested, they have other platforms on which to distract themselves," Perez said. Perez did not provide evidence of younger soccer fans turning away from the sport due to lack of interest nor for the decline in television viewing figures. His comments come shortly after it was announced 12 of Europe's wealthiest soccer teams, including Real Madrid, had signed up as founding members of the ESL. The project has been backed with $6 billion in debt financing from JPMorgan . The ESL is designed to rival the UEFA Champions League, Europe's top annual club competition, and is intended to commence "as soon as it is practicable." Teams that have agreed to play in the ESL: The ESL will eventually comprise of 20 clubs and 15 of those will be permanent, meaning they can't be relegated. That's controversial because teams currently must qualify for the Champions League each year and they can be promoted and relegated from England's Premier League, Spain's La Liga, and Italy's Serie A. The move has sparked outrage among lawmakers, governing bodies, former players, fans, managers and pundits, with many concerned about the ramifications for the structure of domestic competition. That's because the current "pyramid" system allows teams to rise and fall from their respective leagues on merit. The 14 Premier League clubs not participating in the ESL are expected to discuss their response to the matter on Tuesday. UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin has condemned the ESL project, describing the move as "a spit in the face" of all soccer lovers. "We will not allow them to take it away from us," he added. In 2018, the Premier League reported a significant drop in money raised from the sale of rights to broadcast soccer matches in the U.K. BT and Sky bid £4.4 billion ($6.1 billion) to televise the lion share of 200 games for each season between 2019 to 2022. That figure was down from £5.1 billion in 2015. In a joint statement on Sunday, the 12 teams planning to join the ESL said: "The formation of the Super League comes at a time when the global pandemic has accelerated the instability in the existing European football economic model." "The pandemic has shown that a strategic vision and a sustainable commercial approach are required to enhance value and support for the benefit of the entire European football pyramid," they added. The organizers claim the ESL will generate more money than the UEFA Champions League competition and will result in a greater distribution of revenue throughout the sport. World governing body FIFA has sharply criticized the proposal and called for further discussions with those involved. "In our view, and in accordance with our statutes, any football competition, whether national, regional or global, should always reflect the core principles of solidarity, inclusivity, integrity and equitable financial distribution," FIFA said on Monday. "Moreover, the governing bodies of football should employ all lawful, sporting and diplomatic means to ensure this remains the case," they added. — CNBC's Sam Shead contributed to this report.
Pressure has been building on Angela Merkel's conservative alliance to select a candidate to represent the bloc in Germany's general election later this year. Chancellor Angela Merkel announced in 2018 she would not run for a fifth term in office. On Monday night, a majority of senior CDU party officials selected Armin Laschet to be the candidate for chancellor.	In the early hours of Tuesday morning, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative alliance finally selected a candidate to represent the center-right bloc in the country's national election later this year, after months of uncertainty and delay. Up until then, neither the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), nor its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), had been able to agree on who should lead the conservatives into the election on Sep. 26. Merkel announced in 2018 that she would not run for a fifth term in office. At a meeting of the CDU's board Monday night, however, a majority of senior party members voted to nominate Armin Laschet, the leader of the CDU and state-premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, as the candidate for chancellor for this year's election. Some 77.5% (31 members) of the party's federal executive committee voted in favor of the party leader, according to reports from German news outlet Deutsche Welle and Reuters, citing sources, while his rival Markus Soeder, received just 9 votes. The CDU tweeted during the night that there had been "a long and intense debate among the members from the 17 regional associations, district associations and associations about people, election prospects and the mood at the party base" before the vote in favor of Laschet. Soeder, who heads the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, said on Tuesday that he accepted the decision and would support Laschet, wishing him "great success for the difficult challenge ahead," Reuters reported. Speaking later on Tuesday, Laschet called for the conservative bloc to unite, saying: "It is important that the CDU-CSU enter this election campaign as one team," he told a news conference, Reuters said. "The CDU will not win this election without the CSU, and the opposite is also true." The inability of the alliance to present a candidate thus far had been the source of frustration for CDU-CSU officials and had not been lost on opposition politicians who could become influential in forming a new government in September. The CDU-CSU is ahead in various opinion polls but the Greens are not so far behind. Four polls conducted in mid-April in Germany put support for the alliance at around 28-31% while in the same polls support for the Greens stood at between 20-22%. Strategists expect that the most likeliest outcome of the election is that the CDU-CSU will form a coalition with the Greens. Although there is a slim chance that, should the CDU-CSU perform very badly, then the Greens could form a coalition with other parties such as the Social Democrats or the Free Democratic Party. On Monday, the Green Party confirmed that Annalena Baerbock will be its candidate for the next German chancellor . Jürgen Trittin, member of the Bundestag and former leader of Germany's Green Party, told CNBC on Monday that the party now had an outside chance that it could even lead Germany's government come September.2 "I've never seen, in my political life, such a crisis within the conservative Christian Democratic party," Trittin said, arguing that the CDU-CSU's indecision over which candidate will lead the bloc into the election had been damaging to the alliance. "Even if they decide now, the other side of the party is so hurt and damaged they will have a real problem in the election campaign and as a potential coalition partner for whomever." The Green Party is gaining in confidence and even daring to dream it could overtake the CDU/CSU when it comes to the September vote. "Everything is possible," Konstantin von Notz, a member of the Bundestag and Green Party, told CNBC Tuesday. "There should be no doubt about it, it's going to be a very tough election campaign," he said, adding: "People from all parties will be very tough on us because the Greens are saying that we could be the leading party and that wakes ... every enemy up." Ahead of Laschet's endorsement by the CDU overnight, Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, noted on Monday that the "game of chicken" between Laschet and Soeder appeared to be coming to an end and noted what a Laschet chancellorship could mean for Germany. The choice between Soeder and Laschet "is about style, charisma and perceived electoral appeal rather than major differences on substance," he said in a note. "Laschet is widely seen as the continuity candidate. He has usually supported Merkel on other policies including her handling of the 2015 refugee crisis. His somewhat unassuming style and penchant to moderate and bridge differences resembles Merkel's approach," Schmieding noted. He added that Laschet was also likely to "go along with" some additional fiscal burden sharing in the EU and the euro zone.
Germany's Green Party has gone from being somewhat on the fringes of the political establishment, to gaining in popularity and prominence. Now, it's in a position where it could be starting to overtake Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian alliance. One Forsa poll has put the Greens ahead of Merkel's CDU-CSU bloc.	In the space of a few years, Germany's Green Party has gone from being somewhat on the fringes of the political establishment to gaining in popularity and prominence. Now, it's in a position where it could be starting to overtake Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian alliance, the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union (CDU-CSU). If it extends and holds that position, the party could be in charge of Germany's political, economic and, of course, environmental direction after the September 26 election. Recent voter polls have placed the party in second place to the CDU-CSU. But one Forsa Institute survey of 1,502 people, conducted on Tuesday, put the Greens in the lead with 28% of the vote — up 5 percentage points from a similar poll conducted between April 6-12. Support for the CDU-CSU had fallen 6 points to 21%, the same poll showed. Poll aggregator Europe Elects noted on Twitter that if such a result were repeated in the election, it would be the first time since 2005 for Merkel's conservative alliance to not come first. While the Greens certainly appear to be seeing a rising tide of popularity, it should be noted a separate INSA poll for the Bild newspaper on Tuesday put the CDU-CSU at 27% of the vote, and the Greens with 22% of the vote, reflecting similar results in other April polls. In the last election in 2017, the Greens took just 8.9% of the vote, while Merkel's CDU-CSU took a combined 33%. The Forsa poll is bound to give the Green Party a massive boost, adding to solid momentum in recent months and the selection earlier this week of 40-year-old Annalena Baerbock, the party's co-leader, as the Greens' candidate for chancellor. Party officials are increasingly confident of their chances in the election. "Everything is possible," Konstantin von Notz, a member of the Bundestag and Green Party, told CNBC Tuesday, echoing one of the party's slogans. "There should be no doubt about it, it's going to be a very tough election campaign. It's going to be a big controversy, and people from all parties will be very tough on us because the Greens are saying that we could be the leading party and that wakes ... every enemy up." The Greens are attracting voters disaffected with Germany's old guard of political parties. Recent scandals and political infighting within the CDU-CSU — most recently, over who will be the alliance's candidate for chancellor in the September 26 vote — have also benefited the Greens, who appear united, focused and appeal to a liberal, middle-class and environmentally-conscious electorate. Von Notz said the party had seen more voters flock to it in recent years and that many Germans are "tired" of the old political establishment. "Five months to the election is a long way, with a lot of conflicts, no doubt about that, but I strongly believe that we have a very good narrative and strong political ideas about the future for Germany, the future for Europe, and connecting those issues with the economic crisis and the climate change problems that the whole world is facing," he said. As expected, the Greens' central policy pledge is environmental protection. But the party also wants to restructure the country's economic model into a social-ecological system, meaning more of an emphasis on green technologies, exiting coal energy by 2030 and banning cars with combustion engines from German roads by 2030. In order to help finance its program, the party has called for the relaxation of the so-called debt brake which would enable Germany to raise more money on public markets, and has also called for higher taxes on the wealthy.  Money raised from such a wealth tax could partly fund a 50 billion euro ($60 billion) investment program, per year for a decade, that the party proposes in order to transition to a carbon-free economy. Strategists believe a coalition between the CDU-CSU and the Greens is a base-line scenario and one that is being prepared for by the conservative bloc, according to Christian Schulz, director of European economics at Citi Research, who explained what direction such a coalition could go in. "We would expect ambitious climate protection policies backed up by large public investment. We doubt that the CDU/CSU would sanction tax hikes, so extra borrowing is likely to require changes to the constitutional debt brake. This would be possible, given that the opposition SPD and Left Party would not oppose this and secure the necessary two-thirds majority," Schulz said. German business groups are not so convinced by the Greens' policies, however, with the BDI commenting in March the draft election program from the Green Party offered "little light and a lot of shadow." In a statement , BDI Managing Director Joachim Lang warned that "higher taxes and more bureaucracy would cost the economy and society dearly" although he said that the party's calls for a decade of future investments "are to be welcomed." "Higher taxes reduce investment power and hinder future spending on climate protection. Demands for higher CO2 prices without adequate alternatives weaken Germany's competitiveness," he said. "A wealth tax massively reduces investment opportunities. Not only companies suffer from this, but all citizens. From the industry's point of view, the calls for a decade of future investments in order to overcome the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and strengthen Germany as a business location are positive." - CNBC's Annette Weisbach contributed reporting to this story.
Recent economic figures do point to a stronger-than-expected economic recovery. And further coronavirus lockdowns across the euro zone won't likely warrant further action by the central bank.	FRANKFURT — With a policy change pretty much off the table this week, European Central Bank watchers will have to closely monitor finer details about its pandemic stimulus program as policymakers wait for more data before taking decisive action. Recent economic figures do point to a stronger-than-expected economic recovery, and further coronavirus lockdowns across the euro zone won't likely warrant further action by the central bank. "A change in policy stance is unlikely," said Mark Wall, a chief economist with Deutsche Bank, in a research note. "A decision whether or not to maintain the new faster pace of PEPP purchases will be made after a joint assessment of financing conditions and the outlook for inflation at the Council Meeting on June 10," he added, suggesting no updates for the meeting on Thursday this week. In the wake of the pandemic, the ECB launched its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, or PEPP, which buys bonds in the region to stimulate lending and fuel an economic recovery. It left that program unchanged at its meeting in March, with the target purchase amount still at 1.85 trillion euros ($2.21 trillion) — which is due to last until March 2022. However, it decided to accelerate the bond purchases on a monthly basis to alleviate some of the upward pressure of sovereign debt yields in the region — which had meant more expensive refinancing for euro zone countries or a tightening of financial conditions. "PEPP purchases were 74 billion euro in March," Wall explained. "This was significantly higher than the 53 billion euro and 60 billion euro in February and January." But looking at the minutes of the meeting by the ECB's Governing Council in March, it's clear the opposition to rising yields was not as comprehensive as it first appeared. "The decision to accelerate the purchase pace significantly would show that the Governing Council was willing to use the flexibility of the programme, without changing the overall envelope or duration of the programme," the accounts of the March meeting said. The tone of the accounts might be best described as a balancing act between the doves and the hawks at the ECB. More and more signs are emerging that the economy will pick up strongly in the second half of this year. The improved outlook has prompted some policymakers to step out already and hint at an exit to the PEPP. Pierre Wunsch and Klaas Knot, the Belgian and Dutch central bank chiefs respectively, have started the discussion about a possible PEPP exit with the latter suggesting it could come as early as the third quarter of this year. "If the economy develops according to our baseline, we will see better inflation and growth from the second half onwards," Knot said earlier this month. "In that case, it would be equally clear to me that from the third quarter onwards we can begin to gradually phase out pandemic emergency purchases and end them as foreseen in March 2022." This seems like the start of a discussion that will likely gather steam during the course of summer. "We doubt this is priced in by markets but agree that the PEPP exit will be the key topic for the ECB during the summer given that the pace of economic recovery is expected to pick up rapidly in the second half while inflation is expected to rise," said Anatoli Annenkov, an ECB watcher with Societe Generale, in a research note. "It will be difficult to materially taper the PEPP before the (Federal Reserve) which we currently expect to start tapering in early 2022," he added.
The EU and the pharmaceutical giant have been at odds on several different occasions this year. When contacted by CNBC Thursday, a spokesperson for European Commission said: "What matters is that we ensure the delivery of a sufficient number of doses in line with the company's earlier commitments."	LONDON — The European Union is preparing legal action against AstraZeneca over shortfalls in deliveries of its coronavirus vaccine, according to four people familiar with the matter. The EU and the pharmaceutical giant have been at odds on several different occasions this year. Anglo-Swedish firm AstraZeneca said it could not deliver as many vaccines as the bloc was counting on, both during the first quarter and the second quarter. This has delayed the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines across the 27 EU nations. The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, told the 27 European ambassadors at a meeting on Wednesday that it was considering legal action against AstraZeneca for these delivery issues, four EU officials, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, told CNBC Thursday. Politico first reported the commission's plan late Wednesday. "The commission wants to move fast. It is a matter of days," one of the officials told CNBC via telephone, adding that there had been "large support" from the ambassadors for the legal action. The same official explained that there were only "a few legal questions" being examined before the process goes ahead. A second official said the commission is taking this step because it wants to ensure that upcoming deliveries do meet expectations. When contacted by CNBC Thursday, a spokesperson for the European Commission said: "What matters is that we ensure the delivery of a sufficient number of doses in line with the company's earlier commitments." "Together with the Member States, we are looking at all options to make this happen," the same spokesperson said, not confirming or denying that legal action was being considered. In March, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had expressed disappointment with AstraZeneca during a press conference, saying that "AstraZeneca has unfortunately under-produced and under-delivered. And this painfully, of course, reduced the speed of the vaccination campaign." At the time, von der Leyen said the bloc was expecting 70 million doses from the firm in the second quarter, down from 180 million originally anticipated. AstraZeneca's CEO Pascal Soriot had told EU lawmakers in February that low yields at EU production plants were causing the delays. A spokesperson for the pharmaceutical firm told CNBC Thursday: "AstraZeneca is not aware of any legal proceedings and continues to hold regular discussions on supply with the Commission and Member States."
Russia ordered its top army command to begin returning troops to their permanent bases inside the country from Friday. It said it had successfully completed a "snap inspection" of forces in its south and west, near the border with Ukraine, the RIA news agency reported. The announcement prompted the ruble to rise sharply, following weeks of tensions with the West over a major Russian military buildup near Ukraine.	Russia ordered its top army command to begin returning troops to their permanent bases inside the country from Friday, saying it had successfully completed a "snap inspection" of forces in its south and west, near the border with Ukraine, the RIA news agency reported. The announcement prompted the ruble to rise sharply, following weeks of tensions with the West over a major Russian military buildup near Ukraine. It was unclear if the rebasing order covered all of the forces involved in that buildup. The EU's top diplomat said on Monday that Russia has massed some 100,000 troops near the border. "I believe the objectives of the snap inspection have been fully achieved. The troops have demonstrated their ability to provide a credible defence for the country," Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was quoted as saying. "In this regard, I have decided to complete the inspections in the southern and western military districts," he said. He said they would return to their bases by May 1. Shoigu, after overseeing exercises in annexed Crimea near Ukraine's southern border on Thursday, said however that the military had to be ready to respond quickly in case of an "unfavorable" development in the situation near NATO's Defender Europe exercises, the Interfax news agency reported. Defender-Europe is an annual, U.S. Army-led, multinational joint exercise designed to build readiness and interoperability between U.S. and other NATO militaries, as well as other partners. From March to June, more than 28,000 forces from 26 nations will conduct drills across more than 30 training areas in a dozen countries.
More hawkish members of the ECB have expressed hopes that the euro zone's central bank will be able to unwind its coronavirus stimulus program, known as PEPP, in the latter part of 2021. However, this will be dependent on how the pandemic and respective vaccination programs play out.	LONDON — The European Central Bank decided on Thursday to keep its policy unchanged while market players look for clues on when its massive monetary stimulus might start to be wound down. "Preserving favorable financing conditions over the pandemic period remains essential to reduce uncertainty and bolster confidence, thereby underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability," ECB President Lagarde said at a press conference on Thursday. The central bank said last month it was going to increase government bond purchases — though still within the planned envelope of 1.85 trillion euros ($2.2 trillion) until March 2022 — to address rising bond yields in the euro zone. At the time, the ECB expressed concerns with borrowing costs rising sharply for euro area governments before the economy has fully recovered from the coronavirus shock. As a result, data from Deutsche Bank showed the ECB purchased 74 billion euros in bonds in March, up from 53 billion and 60 billion euros in February and January. "The Governing Council expects purchases under the PEPP over the current quarter to continue to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year," the ECB said on Thursday, suggesting it will keep buying more bonds in the coming months in comparison to the first few months of the year. The ECB's loose monetary policy stance is aimed at supporting the 19 euro area economies as they battle with the coronavirus shock. Many European nations have been forced to return to strict lockdowns after a third wave of infections over the Easter period, and there is a lot of uncertainty for the coming months. "Incoming economic data, surveys and high-frequency indicators suggest that economic activity may have contracted again in the first quarter of this year, but point to a resumption of growth in the second quarter," Lagarde told reporters. She added, however, that there is an "overall environment of uncertainty" regarding the economic outlook. Market players are keenly anticipating the June meeting, the next in the ECB's calendar, as the next key moment for monetary stimulus in the euro zone. Hawkish ECB members are hoping that, as vaccination rates rise and economies slowly reopen, they can start talks on when to ease stimulus. However, this will be dependent on how the pandemic and respective vaccination programs play out. Speaking Thursday, Lagarde said there hadn't been discussions so far on a possible phasing out of stimulus, as it was "simply premature." The ECB signaled on Thursday that it will all depend on how financing conditions evolve. "The envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favorable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation," the ECB said in a statement. The ECB's policy mandate is to keep inflation close but below 2%. Current forecasts estimate that inflation will peak 2% in the last quarter of 2021, but to come down throughout 2022. Market reaction was muted after the announcement, as it met analysts' expectations of no further action. The ECB forecast in March a GDP (gross domestic product) rate for 2021 of 4%, and of 4.1% for 2022.
Daimler said that although "visibility is limited at present", it assumes "some recovery" in the availability of chips in the second half of this year. But the German carmaker said it still expects its operating profit this year to be significantly above 2020 as the global economy recovers from the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic.	Mercedes-Benz car maker Daimler AG on Friday raised its profit outlook for 2021, but warned that the global semiconductor chip shortage may continue to impact its sales in the second quarter. Daimler said that although "visibility is limited at present", it assumes "some recovery" in the availability of chips in the second half of this year. But the German carmaker said it still expects its operating profit this year to be significantly above 2020 as the global economy recovers from the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic. The chip shortage has curtailed production for a number of major automakers, including General Motors Co, Stellantis , Ford Motor Co and Daimler's German rival Volkswagen AG . Earlier this week, Daimler cut working hours for up to 18,500 employees and said it would temporarily halt production at two plants in Germany due to the chip shortage. Cars have become increasingly dependent on chips — for everything from computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking. Daimler said it now expected an adjusted margin from its Mercedes cars and van business of between 10% and 12%, up from its previous outlook of between 8% and 10%. Last week, Daimler said that soaring Chinese demand for luxury Mercedes-Benz cars and higher prices drove a better-than-expected profit in the first quarter.
IHS Markit's flash composite PMI for the euro zone, which looks at activity across both manufacturing and services, hit 52.5 in March versus 48.1 in February. The preliminary data points to the first economic expansion in the region since September and the largest increase since last July. But there are concerns about how the euro zone economy will perform in the second quarter as social restrictions are tightened in some nations.	LONDON — Business activity in the euro area expanded  in March, according to preliminary figures on Wednesday, but economies are bracing for a third wave of Covid-19 infections which could derail any recovery. IHS Markit's flash composite PMI for the euro zone, which looks at activity across both manufacturing and services, hit 52.5 in March versus 48.1 in February . A reading above 50 represents an expansion in economic activity. The preliminary data points to the first economic expansion in the region since September and the largest increase since July. "The eurozone economy beat expectations in March, showing a much better than anticipated expansion thanks mainly to a record surge in manufacturing output," Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. Manufacturing has been the biggest driver of economic performance this month, but the services sector — the hardest hit by the pandemic — also experienced an improvement, hitting a seven-month high. However, there are concerns about how the euro zone economy will perform in the second quarter as social restrictions remain a reality. Germany decided this week to extend its lockdown and imposed strict restrictions over the Easter weekend. In France, Paris and about 14 other regions have also been put in lockdown mode on the back of rising infections. Poland has also announced tougher movement restrictions. "The outlook has deteriorated, however, amid rising COVID-19 infection rates and new lockdown measures. This two-speed nature of the economy will therefore likely persist for some time to come, as manufacturers benefit from a recovery in global demand but consumer-facing service companies remain constrained by social distancing restrictions," Williamson said. The European Central Bank estimated earlier this month a GDP (gross domestic product) rate of 4% for the euro area this year and 4.1% for 2022. However, the forecast is dependent on the evolution of the pandemic and the pace of vaccinations in the region. France announced Tuesday a more intense vaccination campaign going forward. Anyone over the age of 70 will be able to be vaccinated from Saturday onward and more vaccination centers will be developed to intensify the rollout starting next month. The latest business activity data for the country came in at a three-month high, though still in contraction territory. France's flash composite output index stood at 49.5 in March, from 47.0 in February. "Activity trended towards stabilization, reversing the downward momentum seen in January and February ... That said, there remain ongoing challenges related to the pandemic," Eliot Kerr, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. "Firstly, raw material shortages continued to drive costs sharply higher, which may act as a squeeze on profit margins until the recovery in demand conditions gathers pace. Secondly, the threat of setbacks to the reopening of the economy remains tangible," he said. Meanwhile, the German manufacturing sector keeps on delivering for Europe's largest economy. Germany's flash composite output index rose to 56.8 from 51.1 in February, representing a 37-month high. The positive economic activity was supported by a record increase in manufacturing output, which reached 68.5 in March, a level not seen since April 1996. "The sustained upturn in the factory sector has seen the manufacturing PMI reach unprecedented heights, with growth in global demand for German goods showing no signs of abating and businesses reporting that previously-delayed investments are now being realized," Phil Smith, associate director at IHS Markit, said in a statement. He added, however, that supply chains are coming under pressure, which is increasing factory input costs at a rapid rate.
In a curious twist of history, Baerbock holds the promise to execute on what turned out to be Angela Merkel's highly misleading self-advertising. In laying her claim to the Federal Chancellery back in 2005, she had advertised herself as a scientist and a no-nonsense, results-oriented decision maker focused on doing the heavy lifting to modernize Germany. Alas, Merkel didn't.	BERLIN — Two things are already certain about Germany's upcoming federal elections this September. The first is that the Greens, out of power since 2005, are the only political party in Germany that is guaranteed to be part of the next government. Second, it is already clear who will be Merkel's successor as Germany's top-ranking female politician. It is Annalena Baerbock, the 40-year-old co-leader of the Greens, who has just been selected as her party's candidate for chancellor . Assuming that her party will most likely govern as a junior partner in tandem with the CDU-CSU, Baerbock has the inside track to be at least Germany's next vice chancellor. In a curious twist of history, Baerbock holds the promise to execute on what turned out to be Angela Merkel's highly misleading self-advertising. In laying her claim to the Federal Chancellery back in 2005, she had advertised herself as a scientist and a no-nonsense, results-oriented decision maker focused on doing the heavy lifting to modernize Germany. Alas, Merkel didn't. A key part of Germany's current conundrum is that the Merkel years, despite the chancellor's solid international reputation, were years of coasting. She never really engaged with the central task of pushing Germany's industrial and political modernization. Yes, she was good on sloganeering and proclaiming ambitions — but very poor on execution. Worse, whenever it came to politically sensitive economic reform issues, Merkel merely punted, if she did not blatantly choose to serve the status-quo powers. Witness the German car industry. Cuddling up to industry thankfully isn't Baerbock's thing. At top industrial policy conferences, she easily takes on the CEOs and association heads of a broad range of industries on the strategic choices needed in their respective sectors, whether automotive, chemical or energy. Given the Greens' origins, the fact that Baerbock is clearly committed to keeping basic materials industries competitive and operating in Germany shows courage and strategic depth. She is also correct in her assessment that pushing industry rigorously toward a green energy future is the only way for Germany to stay a global technology leader. Having a firm strategic grasp of the profound challenges German industry faces at this juncture is an important political asset for any top leader. With Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank , Germany's erstwhile banking giants, mere shadows of their former selves, with ThyssenKrupp on the ropes and a car industry probably facing the biggest competitive challenges of its entire existence, one thing is for sure: Germany truly needs top politicians who have a clear sense of the strategic choices that must be made right after the September elections. All indications are that the woman from Potsdam seems to have the stuff it takes to be a very competent economic strategist. Little surprise then that anyone who, like myself, is a "non-green," finds themselves at times wishing that Baerbock had appeared 15 years earlier on the German political stage. True, Baerbock has never even been a government minister. Like top graduates from France's elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, she easily masters a broad range of very complex policy briefs. Unlike many "ENA-rques," though, she is down to earth and not at all aloof. That gives Baerbock a level of political maturity far beyond her actual age. In addition, her mental alertness and dexterity will prove a real asset in the election campaign, especially as her opponent is the CDU's rather pedestrian and often self-confused Armin Laschet, the CDU chairman. A look beyond Germany's borders underscores that, from Scandinavia to New Zealand, young top female politicians doing a very competent job in their country's highest political office. The contrast they present to the time-worn model — mostly men patiently climbing up the political ladder and doing a lot of backscratching with one another — is hardly a suitable qualification indicating true leadership. So, what government post for Baerbock? Of course, there's always dreaming. As before in 1969, when Willy Brandt won, she could rise to become chancellor, especially if the CDU-CSU keeps fumbling with the gaffe-prone Lasche. The post of Germany's next vice chancellor should be a shoo-in. To give the Greens a strong role in the new government and make the best use of Baerbock's talents, she should be appointed to serve as a kind of "super minister" coordinating economic, energy, environmental and transport policy. As it happens, such a position, best located in the Federal Chancellery itself, is very similar to the posts that Margrethe Vestager and Frans Timmermans hold at the European Commission in Brussels. — Stephan Richter is the publisher and editor-in-chief of The Globalist , the daily online magazine on the global economy, politics and culture.
European countries have stepped up their vaccination rates, but some nations remain in lockdown amid a third wave of Covid-19 infections. IHS Markit's flash composite PMI for the euro zone, which looks at activity across both manufacturing and services, hit 53.7 in April versus 53.2 in March. A reading above 50 represents an expansion in economic activity.	LONDON — Business activity in the euro zone expanded again in April, preliminary data showed on Friday, providing some positive momentum for the second quarter. European countries have stepped up their vaccination rates, but some nations remain in lockdown amid a third wave of Covid-19 infections. IHS Markit's flash composite PMI for the euro zone, which looks at activity across both manufacturing and services, hit 53.7 in April versus 53.2 in March. A reading above 50 represents an expansion in economic activity. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit told CNBC that "containment measures to fight coronavirus were actually tightened and normally we would expect the pace of economic activity to weaken but it has done the opposite." He added that companies were optimistic about the future and preparing for better times ahead. Analysts are also somewhat optimistic for the coming months as governments prepare to ease some of Covid lockdown measures. Italy is opening parts of the economy on Monday, France is considering a cautious reopening from mid-May and Greece has plans to open around that time too. Going forward, Williamson said: "There is going to be a switch between spending on goods and spending on services." Speaking on Thursday, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said: "Incoming economic data, surveys and high-frequency indicators suggest that economic activity may have contracted again in the first quarter of this year, but point to a resumption of growth in the second quarter." She added, however, that there is an " overall environment of uncertainty " regarding the economic outlook. The flash France composite output index reached 51.7 in April, representing a nine-month high and the first expansion in business activity since August. "With an expansion in services activity and another strong rise in manufacturing production during April, the French private sector finally managed to achieve growth," Eliot Kerr, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. The positive momentum in the French economy came from the services sector, with a slight slowdown in manufacturing. Meanwhile, business activity expansion in Germany slowed slightly in April. The flash Germany PMI composite output index hit 56.0, from 57.3 in March. The German services sector stalled slightly and manufacturing faced some supply shortages. Phil Smith, associate director at IHS Markit, said "the imbalance of demand and supply across manufacturing supply chains continues to drive up businesses' costs, which are now rising at the fastest rate for more than a decade." He added that "while factory gate prices are increasing rapidly in line with strong demand for goods, services firms remain more cautious with their pricing, which somewhat limits the spillover to overall consumer prices."
More than 1,000 people have been arrested in Russia after attending unauthorized protests in support of the jailed Putin critic Alexei Navalny. The demonstrations took place across Russia with rallies in the major cities of Moscow and St Petersburg attracting the highest number of attendees, despite a current ban on protests in Russia.	More than 1,000 people have been arrested in Russia after attending unauthorized protests in support of the jailed Putin critic Alexei Navalny. Demonstrations took place across Russia on Wednesday with rallies in the major cities of Moscow and St Petersburg attracting the highest number of attendees, despite a current ban on protests in Russia. OVD-Info, an independent NGO that monitors protests in Russia, said on Twitter the protests had taken place in more than 90 cities across Russia and had led to more than 1,600 arrests, although the number is hard to verify. The monitoring group also said there were reports that police had used tear gas and stun guns on protesters, but these are unverified. Figures on the number of people that attended protests differ wildly. Navalny's team have claimed 60,000 people attended the protest in Moscow, while the Moscow Times, citing a Russian-language media platform, reported 25,000 were on Moscow's central Tverskaya street alone. Russia's Interior Ministry played down the figures, however, estimating a turnout of around 6,000 in Moscow and 4,500 in St. Petersburg, with hundreds of demonstrators at other locations across Russia, according to its Facebook page . Demonstrations in support of Navalny were called by his team as the opposition leader was moved to a prison hospital earlier this week after becoming ill while carrying out a hunger strike in prison. Navalny was sentenced in February to more than two years for parole violations, charges he said were politically motivated. At the weekend, his doctor's warned that Navalny was in danger of a heart attack or kidney failure. The physicians had not been able to visit the activist in prison but said medical tests provided by his family showed he was dangerously ill and " could die at any moment ." There were reports of several arrests of members of Navalny's team ahead of the unsanctioned rallies with Lyubov Sobol, who features regularly on Navalny's popular YouTube channel, and Kira Yarmysh, his spokeswoman, both detained in Moscow, their lawyers said, according to Reuters. The U.S. administration has warned the Russian government to not let Navalny die in custody, adding that there will be "consequences." Russian President Vladimir Putin made no mention of Navalny in his "state of the union" address on Wednesday, as protests took place. However, he warned the West against any provocations of Russia and crossing its "red lines." Last summer, Navalny was medically evacuated to Germany from a Russian hospital after he was poisoned by a chemical nerve agent. The German government said toxicology reports showed " unequivocal evidence " that Navalny was exposed to a nerve agent in the Novichok family, which was developed by the Soviet Union . Toxicology tests conducted in France and Sweden also came to the same conclusion. Navalny has accused Putin of ordering the poison attack, although Putin and the Kremlin have repeatedly denied having a role in the poisoning.
The EU last week released a new policy aimed at stepping up its influence in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China's rising power. The Philippines on Friday protested to China over its failure to withdraw what it called as "threatening" boats believed to be manned by maritime militia around a disputed reef. China is increasingly worried that Europe and other countries are heeding U.S. President Joe Biden's call for a "coordinated approach" towards China.	The European Union called out China on Saturday for endangering peace in the South China Sea and urged all parties to abide by a 2016 tribunal ruling which rejected most of China's claim to sovereignty in the sea, but which Beijing has rejected. The EU last week released a new policy aimed at stepping up its influence in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China's rising power. The Philippines on Friday protested to China over its failure to withdraw what it called as "threatening" boats believed to be manned by maritime militia around the disputed Whitsun Reef, which Manila calls the Julian Felipe Reef. "Tensions in the South China Sea, including the recent presence of large Chinese vessels at Whitsun Reef, endanger peace and stability in the region," a EU spokesperson said in a statement on Saturday. EU reiterated its strong opposition to "unilateral actions that could undermine regional stability and international rules-based order". It urged all parties to resolve disputes peacefully in accordance with international law, and highlighted a 2016 international arbitration that had ruled in favor of the Philippines while invalidating most of China's claims in the South China Sea. China rejected EU's accusation that its ships at Whitsun Reef, which China calls Niu'E Jiao, had endangered peace and security. The Chinese Mission to the EU in a statement on Saturday reiterated that the reef is part of China's Nansha Islands, or Spratly Islands, and that it was "reasonable and lawful" for Chinese fishing boats to operate there and shelter from the wind. The Chinese statement also insisted that China's sovereignty, rights and interests in the South China Sea were formed in the "long course of history and consistent with international law" and rejected the 2016 tribunal ruling as "null and void". "The South China Sea should not become a tool for certain countries to contain and suppress China, much less a wrestling ground for major-power rivalry," the Chinese statement said. China is increasingly worried that Europe and other countries are heeding U.S. President Joe Biden's call for a "coordinated approach" towards China, which had so far materialized in the form of sanctions over its security crackdown in Hong Kong and treatment of Uyghur Muslims. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken last month said Washington "stands by its ally, the Philippines," in the face of China's massing maritime militia at Whitsun Reef.
A top European Union official said Sunday that Americans who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 should be able to travel to Europe by summer, easing existing travel restrictions. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told The New York Times that the union's 27 members would accept, unconditionally, all those who are vaccinated with vaccines that are approved" by the European Medicines Agency. The agency has approved the three vaccines used in the United States.	A top European Union official said Sunday that Americans who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 should be able to travel to Europe by summer, easing existing travel restrictions. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told The New York Times that the union's 27 members would accept, unconditionally, all those who are vaccinated with vaccines that are approved" by the European Medicines Agency. The agency has approved the three vaccines used in the United States. "The Americans, as far as I can see, use European Medicines Agency-approved vaccines," von der Leyen said. "This will enable free movement and travel to the European Union." She did not say when travel could resume. The EU largely shut down nonessential travel more than a year ago. European Union countries agreed this month to launch Covid-19 travel passes that would permit people who have been vaccinated against the disease, recovered from an infection or have tested negative to travel more easily.
The EU and the pharmaceutical giant have been at odds several times this year. Anglo-Swedish firm said it could not deliver as many vaccines as the bloc was counting on. This has delayed the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines across the 27 EU nations.	The European Union confirmed Monday it's taking legal action against AstraZeneca over shortfalls in the deliveries of its coronavirus vaccine. "Our priority is to ensure Covid-19 vaccine deliveries take place to protect the health of European Union," the EU's commissioner for health, Stella Kyriakides, said Monday via Twitter. "This is why the European Commission has decided jointly with all Member States to bring legal proceedings against AstraZeneca." "Every vaccine dose counts. Every vaccine dose saves lives," she added. The EU and the pharmaceutical giant have been at odds several times this year. The Anglo-Swedish drug company said it could not deliver as many vaccines as the bloc was counting on, both during the first and second quarters. This has delayed the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines across the 27 EU nations. "Following an unprecedented year of scientific discovery, very complex negotiations, and manufacturing challenges, our company is about to deliver almost 50m doses to European countries by the end of April, in line with our forecast," AstraZeneca said in a statement on Monday. "AstraZeneca has fully complied with the Advance Purchase Agreement with the European Commission and will strongly defend itself in court. We believe any litigation is without merit and we welcome this opportunity to resolve this dispute as soon as possible," the firm also said. In March, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had expressed disappointment with the company, saying that "AstraZeneca has unfortunately under-produced and under-delivered. And this painfully, of course, reduced the speed of the vaccination campaign." At the time, von der Leyen said the bloc was expecting 70 million doses from the company in the second quarter, down from 180 million originally anticipated. The bloc was also expecting 120 million doses in the first three months of the year, but received only about 30 million. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot had told EU lawmakers in February that low production at EU plants were causing the delays.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing a mounting controversy this week over comments he allegedly made last year. News headlines in the U.K. are currently dominated with reports that Johnson allegedly told aides in Downing Street that he would rather see the "bodies pile high in their thousands" than approve a third lockdown. Johnson and Downing Street strongly deny the reports.	British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing mounting controversy this week over comments he allegedly made last year during the height of the country's coronavirus pandemic. News headlines in the U.K. are dominated by reports that Johnson allegedly told aides in Downing Street that he would rather see the "bodies pile high in their thousands" than approve a third national lockdown. Johnson and Downing Street have vehemently denied that he used the phrase. On Monday, Johnson described the reports as "absolute rubbish," and when asked whether he had made the remark, told reporters: "No, but again, I think the important thing … that people want us to get on and do as a government is to make sure that the lockdowns work, and they have." The alleged comments, first reported by the Daily Mail Sunday citing anonymous Conservative Party sources, were reportedly said by the prime minister in mid-October after he had reluctantly agreed to a second lockdown that the country began in November. The paper claimed the prime minister, frustrated over having to impose a second round of restrictions on public life and the economy, told aides: "No more ----ing lockdowns — let the bodies pile high in their thousands!" The BBC and ITV both backed the story Monday, saying unnamed sources had also confirmed to them that the comments were made. The alleged comments have provoked a frenzy among the British tabloid media, and hurt among the families of Covid victims after a difficult year for the country. The U.K. has been badly hit by the pandemic; to date, it has recorded over 4.2 million cases and over 127,000 deaths. Still, its efficient vaccination rollout has enabled it to dramatically reduce the number of Covid cases, hospitalizations and deaths. The reports come at a bad time for the prime minister, amid a flurry of stories that have put his conduct and integrity under the microscope. In the last week there have been questions over the source of funding for the refurbishment of Johnson's residence, Downing Street leaks to the press and contact between high-ranking officials and business leaders. Much of the scrutiny comes after a series of damaging allegations were made by Johnson's former chief aide Dominic Cummings last week, which also increased speculation over power struggles in Downing Street last year. The BBC reported that Johnson will chair a cabinet meeting Tuesday as he attempts to deflect attention from the growing furor. A Downing Street spokesperson told CNBC Tuesday: "The government is totally focused on delivering the people's priorities as we continue our vaccination programme and recover from coronavirus, creating new jobs and building back better." On the refurbishment of Johnson's residence at Downing Street, No.10 said the "costs of wider refurbishment in this year have been met by the Prime Minister personally." British newspapers, and the political opposition, are unlikely to let the PM off the hook so readily, however. The Daily Mail — a right-leaning newspaper that has previously supported Boris Johnson — headlined its paper with "Boris on the ropes" on Tuesday, while the Metro paper led its front page with the phrase: "PM tainted by sleaze, say voters," citing a poll that showed half of those polled believed there was a "culture of sleaze" in government. The headlines came after Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Rachel Reeves said, "we're seeing the pipes burst with the sewage of allegations" against the government. She also described Johnson's alleged comments, which have been taken to suggest that he would have rather allowed thousands of deaths rather than another lockdown, as "stomach churning." The left-leaning Guardian newspaper headlined its paper Tuesday with: "Pressure on Johnson after claim of slur on Covid dead," while the right-leaning Daily Express led with Johnson's rebuttal: "Boris denies 'let bodies pile high' outburst." Further reports emerged on Tuesday, however, with The Times newspaper saying it had been "repeatedly told" — although it did not name sources — that Johnson had said last September that he would rather let the coronavirus "rip" than impose a second lockdown because of the economic harm further restrictions would cause.
Public preference for the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford has fallen since reports potentially linking it to some cases of unusual blood clotting events. A study of almost 5,000 adults in April in the U.K. has found that the public's preference for the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine has declined since March. Although the belief that it causes blood clots has increased, public belief in vaccination remains strong.	LONDON — Public preference for the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford has fallen since reports emerged potentially linking it to some cases of unusual blood clotting events. A study of almost 5,000 adults in April in the U.K. — where Covid vaccine take-up is high and the immunization program well-established — has found that the public's preference for the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine has declined since March, and belief that it causes blood clots has increased. The British academic study found 17% of the public now say they'd prefer to have the AstraZeneca vaccine, if they had a choice of any — down from 24% toward the end of March. And 23% of people now believe the AstraZeneca vaccine causes blood clots — up from 13% in March. However, the public are still most likely to say this claim is false (39%) or that they don't know whether it's true (38%). The study, carried out by the University of Bristol, King's College London and the NIHR Health Protection Unit in Emergency Preparedness and Response between April 1-16, found a "big difference" in beliefs before and after the MHRA (the U.K.'s drug regulator) announced there was a possible link between the vaccine and extremely rare blood clots on April 7. The study found that 17% of those interviewed in the first week of that month thought this claim was true, compared with 31% interviewed after. Since its first clinical data was released showing the vaccine had an average efficacy rate of 70% ( subsequent trials in the U.S. found an efficacy rate of 79% and other trials have shown the efficacy rate to rise with a wider gap between the first and second doses ) the fortunes of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been mixed, to say the least. Read more:  Data, doubts and disputes: A timeline of AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine problems One of the more recent hurdles faced by the AstraZeneca vaccine were a small number of reports of unusual blood clotting events, some of which were fatal, that emerged in post-vaccinated people in Europe in February, leading several countries to suspend use of the vaccine. The U.K. and EU drug regulators (the U.K.'s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the European Medicines Agency) investigated the reports and said while there was a possible link between the vaccine and a small number of blood clotting incidents , the benefits of the vaccine greatly outweighed the risks. The British-Swedish vaccine maker, U.K. government and experts largely defended the vaccine, saying that it had protected millions of people by reducing the number of Covid cases, hospitalizations and deaths . In addition, experts sought to put the risk into context , saying that the number of rare blood clotting cases with low platelets reported equated to around one case per 250,000 people vaccinated and one death in a million. The U.K. is fortunate in that it has traditionally had a high level of public support for vaccinations. The survey on vaccine preference found that despite the growing belief that the AstraZeneca vaccine is linked to blood clots, it has not dented overall levels of confidence in vaccines in general with 81% now saying vaccines are safe, compared with 73% who said the same toward the end of 2020.  There has been a similar change in views of how well vaccines work: 86% say they are effective, an increase from 79% in Nov-Dec 2020. Surveys have shown the public perception of the AstraZeneca vaccine has deteriorated in mainland Europe, however, and anecdotal evidence that people in the EU have been shunning the AstraZeneca vaccine (reportedly nicknamed the "Aldi" vaccine, after the low-cost grocery chain, because of its cheaper production cost and image) in favor of the coronavirus vaccine from Pfizer -BioNTech that is also predominant in the EU's vaccination rollout.

Vaccine hesitancy can work both ways, it would seem. One British doctor was reported in the Evening Standard newspaper in January saying that some of his patients had turned down the chance to have the Pfizer vaccine, saying they would "wait for the English one."
A single dose of a coronavirus vaccine can reduce household transmission by up to half, a U.K. study has found. People who become infected with the coronavirus three weeks after receiving a single dose of a Covid vaccine were between 38% and 49% less likely to pass the virus on to their household contacts than those who were unvaccinated. The study was carried out by Public Health England.	LONDON — A single dose of a coronavirus vaccine can reduce transmission within a household by up to half, a study by Public Health England has found. People who do become infected with the coronavirus three weeks after receiving a single dose of the Pfizer - BioNTech or AstraZeneca -University of Oxford vaccine were between 38% and 49% less likely to pass the virus on to their household contacts than those who were unvaccinated, the PHE study found. Protection was seen from around 14 days after vaccination, with similar levels of protection regardless of age of cases or contacts. This protection is on top of the reduced risk of a vaccinated person developing symptomatic infection in the first place, which is around 60% to 65% – four weeks after one dose of either vaccine, PHE noted. Having both doses of a coronavirus vaccine ( the delay between doses is up to 12 weeks in the U.K. ) confers an even higher level of protection against Covid infection. The U.K.'s Health Secretary Matt Hancock hailed the study's findings as "terrific news." "We already know vaccines save lives and this study is the most comprehensive real-world data showing they also cut transmission of this deadly virus." "It further reinforces that vaccines are the best way out of this pandemic as they protect you and they may prevent you from unknowingly infecting someone in your household." "I urge everybody to get their vaccines as soon as they are eligible and make sure you get your second dose for the strongest possible protection," he added. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines are being widely deployed in the U.K., with the Moderna vaccine also now added to the immunization program. The vaccine rollout has been a standout success in Britain, and one silver lining following the destruction of the pandemic, which has caused over 127,000 deaths so far in the country. The U.K has seen cases, hospitalizations and deaths fall dramatically since its rollout started in December, alongside strict lockdown measures. To date, almost 34 million U.K. adults have had a first dose of a vaccine and over 13 million have had two doses, government data shows. The PHE study noted that households are high-risk settings for transmission and provide early evidence on the impact of vaccines in preventing onward transmission. Similar results could be expected in other settings with similar transmission risks, such as shared accommodations and prisons, it noted. The study, which is a pre-print that has not yet been peer-reviewed, included over 57,000 contacts from 24,000 households in which there was a lab-confirmed coronavirus case that had received a vaccination, compared with nearly 1 million contacts of unvaccinated cases. By linking case and household contact data with vaccination status, the study compared the likelihood of transmission for a vaccinated case with an unvaccinated one. PHE is also undertaking separate studies on the effect of vaccination on transmission in the wider population.
The Department of Transport said Wednesday that it has "set out" how vehicles equipped with an automated lane-keeping system (ALKS) could legally be defined as self-driving. Such systems, which were first used in Japan, can help a vehicle to stay in its lane in slow-moving motorway traffic, while allowing the driver to safely take over when necessary. The government said the use of ALKS will be limited to speeds of up to 37 miles per hour on motorways.	LONDON — The U.K. government announced Wednesday that the first types of "self-driving" cars could be on British roads by the end of 2021, paving the way for the nation to start catching up with the U.S. and other countries. The Department of Transport said Wednesday that it has "set out" how vehicles equipped with an automated lane-keeping system (ALKS) could legally be defined as self-driving, providing there's no evidence to challenge the vehicle's ability to self-drive. Such systems, which were first used in Japan, can help a vehicle to stay in its lane in slow-moving traffic on motorways (freeways), while allowing the driver to take their hands off the steering wheel but safely take over when necessary. They can't, however, be relied on to navigate a car from a London borough to a suburb just outside Birmingham, for example. British Transport Minister Rachel Maclean hailed the announcement as a "major step" for the safe use of self-driving vehicles in the U.K., adding that it could make future journeys greener, easier, and more reliable. The government said the use of ALKS will be limited to speeds of up to 37 miles per hour on British motorways, meaning it will only really be used in heavy traffic. It did not immediately respond when CNBC asked if it is planning to trial the technology or allow members of the public to use ALKS in their own cars. Thatcham Research, a firm that carries out safety tests for motor insurance companies, said the ALKS systems can't be thought of as being automated in their current form. "They are assisted driving systems as they rely on the driver to take back control," said Matthew Avery, director of research at Thatcham Research, in a blog post on the company's website. "Aside from the lack of technical capabilities, by calling ALKS automated our concern also is that the U.K. Government is contributing to the confusion and frequent misuse of assisted driving systems that have unfortunately already led to many tragic deaths," Avery added. Stan Boland, CEO and co-founder of Five , a self-driving software company headquartered in the U.K., told CNBC that ALKS is only available as a feature on a reduced set of premium cars, such as certain models of the Honda Legend and the new electric Mercedes S-class . "The immediate impact of ALKS in its current form will be quite modest," he said. However, it could pave the way toward full self-driving technology in the future. "It will lead to later iterations of the regulation that permit increased speed (eventually to 130kph/70mph), more complex maneuvers (like lane changes and overtakes) and engagement of the system on fully-mixed traffic public roads," said Boland. "Those later iterations will be much more significant in permitting safe automated driving over long and complex journeys, allowing consumers to read, chat, use their devices and so on whilst being driven," Boland added. Mike Hawes, chief executive of The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said that automated driving systems could prevent 47,000 serious accidents and save 3,900 lives over the next decade. As it stands, self-driving systems are far from perfect and Tesla's "Autopilot" system has resulted in a number of crashes. Tech giants like Google and Apple are also working on their own self-driving technology. The government said that self-driving technology could eventually help to reduce urban congestion as traffic lights and vehicles will be able to "speak" to each other. It added that connected and autonomous vehicle technology could create around 38,000 new jobs and that the industry could grow to be worth £42 billion ($58 billion) by 2035. So-called "smart motorways" have been another area of focus for the U.K. government. These stretches of road turn the breakdown lane into a usable traffic lane, and limit speeds or close lanes using overhead electronic signs. They're designed to increase capacity and reduce congestion in particularly busy areas, but they've been criticized after a number of deadly crashes where stationary cars were hit.
Electoral Commission opens formal investigation. Says there are grounds to suspect an offence. PM under pressure over apartment renovation. Opposition Labour Party demands an explanation.	Britain's electoral commission opened a formal investigation into the financing of the refurbishment of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Downing Street apartment, saying there were grounds to suspect an offence may have been committed. Eight days before local elections across England, as well as the election of the Welsh and Scottish regional assemblies, Johnson is facing a stream of allegations about everything from his muddled initial handling of the Covid-19 crisis to questions about who leaked what from his office. "We are now satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred," the electoral commission said. "We will therefore continue this work as a formal investigation to establish whether this is the case." The commission said it had been in contact with Johnson's Conservative Party over the issue since late March. The investigation will determine whether any transactions relating to the works at 11 Downing Street fall within the regime regulated by the commission and whether such funding was reported as required. Asked last month about the refurbishment, Johnson's spokeswoman said all donations, gifts and benefits were properly declared, and that no Conservative Party funds were being used to pay for the refurbishment. Johnson has a taxpayer-funded £30,000 ($42,000) allowance each year for maintaining and furnishing his official residence, but anything above that is supposed to come out of the prime minister's own pocket. Ministers have said Johnson has paid for the work himself, but it is unclear when he paid, and whether the refurbishment, reported to have cost £200,000 ($280,000) was initially financed by a loan of some kind. Under political financing rules, Johnson would have been required to declare this. The opposition Labour Party has demanded an explanation. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner wrote to Simon Case, the head of the civil service, asking him to investigate answers about the affair given by Johnson's then-press secretary earlier this year. Allegra Stratton, a former BBC journalist, was Johnson's press secretary from October until last week. Dominic Cummings, who was Johnson's key adviser on the Brexit campaign and helped him to win an election in 2019 before an acrimonious split last year, said on Friday that Johnson had wanted donors to pay for the renovation secretly. Cummings said he had told the prime minister such plans were "unethical, foolish, possibly illegal". Asked if Johnson had received a loan from the Conservative Party for the refurbishment, transport minister Grant Shapps told Sky News: "The prime minister has already paid for it." In a further damaging allegation, the Daily Mail newspaper on Sunday cited unidentified sources as saying that, in October, shortly after agreeing to a second lockdown, Johnson had told a meeting in Downing Street: "No more fucking lockdowns — let the bodies pile high in their thousands." Asked on Monday whether he had made the remark, Johnson told broadcasters: "No, but again, I think the important thing, I think, that people want us to get on and do as a government is to make sure that the lockdowns work, and they have."
Announcement adds to instability in the British province, where angry young pro-British loyalists have rioted over the perceived growing power of Irish nationalists and post-Brexit trade barriers with the rest of the United Kingdom. Comes a day after a majority of DUP lawmakers signed a letter seeking a confidence vote in Foster amid discontent over her leadership, including her perceived mishandling of Brexit negotiations.	Arlene Foster is to step down as Northern Ireland's First Minister at the end of June, bowing to pressure from members of her Democratic Unionist Party unhappy at her leadership over Brexit and social issues. Her announcement adds to instability in the British province, where angry young pro-British loyalists have rioted over the perceived growing power of Irish nationalists and post-Brexit trade barriers with the rest of the United Kingdom. Foster, who has led its largest pro-British party for more than five years, said in a statement that she would also step down as party leader on May 28. She described her leadership of Northern Ireland as "the privilege of my life." The announcement comes a day after a majority of DUP lawmakers signed a letter seeking a confidence vote in Foster amid discontent over her leadership, including her perceived mishandling of Brexit negotiations. Foster has called on the European Union and Britain to scrap the Northern Ireland Protocol, which has imposed trade barriers that led to some supermarket shortages and a number of British companies ceasing deliveries to the region. While the European Union has said it will not consider scrapping the Protocol, some party members have demanded a harder line. Some party members have also complained that she is too liberal for the DUP, one of the most socially conservative political parties in the United Kingdom.
Germany, like other European Union countries, aims to cut emissions by 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. Legislation passed in 2019 set specific targets for sectors such as housing and transport for that period, but not for the long-term goal of cutting emissions to 'net zero' by 2050. The court ordered the government to come up with new targets from 2030 onward by the end of next year.	Germany's top court ruled Thursday that the government has to set clear goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions after 2030, arguing that current legislation doesn't go far enough in ensuring climate change is limited to acceptable levels. Several individuals from Germany and elsewhere, backed by environmental groups, had filed four complaints to the Constitutional Court arguing that their rights were impinged by the lack of sufficient targets beyond the next decade. Germany, like other European Union countries, aims to cut emissions by 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. Legislation passed in 2019 set specific targets for sectors such as housing and transport for that period, but not for the long-term goal of cutting emissions to 'net zero' by 2050. "The regulations irreversibly pushed a very high burden of emissions reduction into the period after 2030," judges said in their ruling. They cited the Paris accord goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), ideally 1.5 C (2.7 F) by the end of the century compared with pre-industrial times. The court ordered the government to come up with new targets from 2030 onward by the end of next year. Lawyer Felix Ekardt, who brought one of the cases, said the verdict was "groundbreaking" for Germany. "Germany's climate policy will need to be massively adjusted," he said. Fellow lawyer Roda Verheyen said that in practice the decision would likely mean Germany's plans to phase out the use of coal by 2038 will need to be brought forward, in order to realistically achieve the long-term emissions reduction target. "A simple calculator shows that this will be necessary," she said. Climate campaigners expressed delight at the verdict. "It's an incredibly good day for hundreds of thousands of young people," said activist Luisa Neubauer, who was one of the plaintiffs. "With today's decision generational justice has been achieved," she said. "Because our future freedoms and rights aren't less important than the rights and freedoms of today's generation." Germany is holding federal elections in September. The environmentalist Greens party, which has called for tougher emissions reduction targets, is currently leading in several polls. Annalena Baerbock, the Greens' candidate to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor, called the verdict a "historic decision." "Protecting the climate protects our freedom and the freedoms of our children and grandchildren," she wrote on Twitter. "The coming years are decisive for resolute action." Germany's economy minister, Peter Altmaier, called the verdict "significant," saying it would provide businesses with "planning certainty." The cases in Germany are part of a global effort by climate activists to force governments to take urgent action to tackle climate change. Among the first successful cases was brought in the Netherlands, where the Supreme Court two years ago confirmed a ruling requiring the government to cut emissions by at least 25% by the end of 2020 from benchmark 1990 levels.
The threat posed by the coronavirus "remains present," the World Health Organization said. Europe's cases have fallen "significantly" in the last week, WHO's regional director for Europe, Dr. Hans Kluge, said in a press conference on Thursday.	LONDON — The threat for Europe posed by the coronavirus "remains present," the World Health Organization said Thursday, despite a recent decline in new cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the region. "It is 462 days since the first Covid-19 cases were reported. Based on numbers of confirmed cases, 5.5% of the entire European population have now had Covid-19, while 7% have completed a full vaccination series," WHO's regional director for Europe, Dr. Hans Kluge, said in a press conference on Thursday. "But even as new cases, hospitalizations and deaths decline, the threat remains present," Kluge warned. The virus still carries the potential to inflict devastating effects, he added, noting that close to half of all reported infections in Europe since the pandemic began have actually come during the first four months of this year. Signaling some hope for the region, however, he added that "for the first time in two months, new cases fell significantly last week. Yet, infection rates across the region remain extremely high." The comments come amid a mixed picture of recovery across the globe. While India is struggling with a devastating surge in cases and lack of medical supplies, other parts of the world are starting to reopen their economies. In Europe, the U.K. is steadily lifting its lockdown and its vaccination rollout continues at pace. To date, almost 34 million adults in the country have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and over 13 million people have had two doses, government data shows . In mainland Europe, over 133 million doses of Covid vaccines have been administered so far across 30 counties in the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), according to data from the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The speed of vaccination programs differs wildly throughout the EU, with some countries forging ahead quicker than others . WHO's Kluge urged governments to not allow vaccination programs, public engagement with vaccines or surveillance of the virus, falter. "Where vaccination rates in high-risk groups are highest, admissions to hospitals are decreasing and death rates are falling. Vaccines are saving lives, and they will change the course of this pandemic and eventually help end it," he said. "We also need to be conscious of the fact that vaccines alone, will not 'end the pandemic.' Without informing and engaging communities, they remain exposed to the virus. Without surveillance, we can't identify new variants. And without contact tracing, governments may need to reimpose restrictive measures."
Florentino Perez, the president of Real Madrid which was one of the clubs involved, has told Spanish media that the project, or one very similar, will still move on. His Barcelona counterpart Joan Laporta has stressed that the ESL clubs are open to dialogue with UEFA, Europe's governing body, in a bid to revive the project.	LONDON — While the soccer community celebrated the failed launch of the European Super League last week, the motivating factors behind the proposal haven't gone away. Now known as the "dirty dozen," 12 powerful European soccer clubs tried to form their own enclosed league, which was scuppered just days afterward due to pressure from fans, authorities and governments. These teams, particularly in Spain, are still nursing pandemic-induced debt, while revenues at many clubs around the world have been hit after virus restrictions forced games to be played behind closed doors — evaporating matchday incomes. Florentino Perez, the president of Real Madrid which was one of the clubs involved, has told Spanish media that the project, or one very similar, will still move on. His Barcelona counterpart Joan Laporta has stressed that the ESL clubs are open to dialogue with UEFA, Europe's governing body, in a bid to revive the project. Simon Chadwick, a director of Eurasian sport at the Emlyon Business School, believes suggestions that the Super League has fallen apart are naive, telling CNBC that Europe will get a "super league by a different name," adding that it is "a case of when, not if." Chadwick argues that the coming years will bring further polarization and industrial concentration, with the big clubs set to accumulate further power, and the gap between them and the smaller clubs growing further. This, he says, will be seen through how major clubs look to develop new revenue streams, with over-the-top broadcasting set to feature prominently. He compares the NFL's recent TV rights deal, worth around $110 billion over 11 years, to the English Premier League's current domestic broadcast deal worth £4.7 billion ($6.6 billion), secured in 2018 and due to run out this year. While the NFL has grown in popularity outside of the U.S. in recent years, it is still dwarfed globally by England's Premier League, with the UEFA Champions League also having an avid worldwide audience. Tech companies have joined the bidding wars for the Premier League's broadcast rights in recent auctions, easing the logistical obstacles to global distribution. The fallout from the Super League proposals has also seen some fans call for new club owners. Spotify CEO and founder Daniel Ek has expressed his interest in buying Arsenal, telling CNBC he has secured the funds for a potential offer for the North London club. But current owner Stan Kroenke, who also owns NFL franchise the LA Rams, has ruled out any sale, stressing he would not entertain any offer. Meanwhile Jim O'Neill, the chairman of British think tank Chatham House and former chair of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, and the hedge fund manager Paul Marshall have called on the owners of Manchester United, the Glazer family, to cut their majority stake to a maximum of 49.9% in a bid to allow for a broader group of investors to have a say in the running of the club. Chadwick downplayed the prospect of current owners looking to sell, adding that "if this is such an unprofitable, difficult business that doesn't yield the kinds of returns that owners are looking for," then Manchester United's owners, the Glazers, would have pulled out a long time ago.
Most of the region's largest economies — Germany, Italy and Spain — saw a decline in activity during the first three months of the year. France was an exception, with Europe's second-largest economy posting better-than-expected growth. Looking ahead, however, economists are confident about 2021 for the euro zone.	LONDON — The euro zone economy  contracted in the first quarter of 2021 as countries implemented new lockdowns and restrictions amid a third wave of coronavirus infections. Gross domestic product in the region fell by 0.6%  quarter on quarter , according to preliminary data released by Europe's statistics office Eurostat. It marks the second consecutive quarter of contractions, meaning the region is in a technical recession, although economists are optimistic about growth looking ahead. Most of the region's largest economies — Germany, Italy and Spain — saw a decline in activity during the first three months of the year. The sharpest fall in activity occurred in Portugal, which has faced a wave of new Covid cases and led to the country's second lockdown. France was an exception, with the euro zone's second-largest economy posting better-than-expected growth of 0.4% in the first quarter. Though the French economy remains below its pre-Covid levels, the growth numbers will bring some reassurance going into the second quarter. France's consumer spending also expanded by 0.3% in the first quarter, despite the reintroduction of certain Covid restrictions. French President Emmanuel Macron announced earlier this week an easing of measures, allowing cafes, bars and restaurants to offer service outdoors from May 19 — which could help the economic recovery. However, in Germany, the economy contracted 1.7% over the same period. It's worse than the 1.5% decline that analysts surveyed by Reuters were expecting. The nation has been severely hit by a third wave of Covid infections, and different approaches among its various regions have further complicated its fight against the pandemic. In Italy, the latest GDP numbers showed a contraction of 0.4% for the quarter, slightly better than expectations. The Spanish economy also shrank over the same period, by 0.5%, while Portugal's economic activity contracted by 3.3%. Looking ahead, however, economists are confident about 2021 for the euro zone. "Confirmation that the euro-zone economy contracted again in Q1 (first quarter) means that the region suffered a second technical recession in just over a year," analysts at Capital Economics said via email. "The good news, however, is that things should get better towards the end of Q2 as the vaccination program will allow governments to lift restrictions, hopefully for the last time." Countries in the region are due to start receiving EU-wide Covid support funds in the second half of the year. Several nations have already submitted their plans on how they intend to use the funds for analysis by the European Commission. "It is important the plans are in line with our targets," European Commission trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said Friday on CNBC's "Street Signs Europe." The Brussels-based institution asked nations to spend at least 37% of the stimulus on climate policies, and 20% on the digital transformation. "The funding will be available to member states once they complete certain milestones and targets," he added. In addition, the vaccination campaign has accelerated significantly since the start of 2021, which is also boosting growth expectations for the region. The European Union expects to have 70% of the adult population vaccinated this summer, and tourism-reliant countries are hoping that a larger number of vaccinated people will allow them to have a more successful summer season this year. "Vaccination is gathering pace," Dombrovskis said, despite an initial slowdown in the rollout because AstraZeneca was "underdelivering." The pharmaceutical firm, which has developed a Covid vaccine, has failed to meet the EU's expectations for vaccine deliveries. The region was expecting 120 million doses in the first quarter, but only about 30 million were delivered. For the second quarter, the EU was expecting 180 million doses but AstraZeneca has already said it might deliver only about 70 million. The commission filed legal action against the pharma giant last Friday and a Brussels court has already begun examining the case, which could be concluded as early as June. AstraZeneca was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday.
As widespread coronavirus vaccination programs continue in the West, attention is turning to the summer season. The potential for growing tensions between the vaccinated and unvaccinated could arise, one poll shows. It's still widely uncertain how and whether types of "vaccine passports" will be introduced.	LONDON — As coronavirus vaccination programs progress, attention is turning to summer vacations and what kind of freedoms we might experience this year — and whether this depends on our vaccination status. A new U.K. study has highlighted the potential for tension between those that are vaccinated and the unvaccinated, especially if there are travel restrictions on those that have not yet received a Covid shot. A British poll released Friday showed the potential for so-called "vaccine resentment" is present. Nearly one in five people who haven't had a Covid vaccine said they'll feel resentful toward those who have, if they don't get one in time for their summer vacation. The issue is salient as multiple countries consider how, and whether, to introduce a type of "vaccine passport" that could allow anyone who is vaccinated to travel. Critics of the idea say it would be unfair to the unvaccinated whether by dint of their age — younger people in most countries are yet to be vaccinated given their lower risk from the coronavirus — or through their choice not to be vaccinated. Travel industry bodies also worry that there could be a lack of standardized approach. For example, the EU is considering a "green digital certificate" that would show whether someone is vaccinated or has recovered from Covid or has had a recent negative test. In the U.K., meanwhile, vaccine "passports" with one's vaccination status linked to the National Health Service app could be used. The U.K. government is set to reveal a list of countries on May 17 where travel is permitted to with, or without, quarantining on return. But entry requirements for Brits to other countries, and vice versa, remains to be seen. The U.K. has one thing going for it in that it has leapt ahead with its vaccination program; around 34 million adults have been vaccinated so far with a single dose of a Covid vaccine, and over 13 million have had two doses. The majority of under-40s in Britain are yet to be called for vaccination but are next in line for a Covid shot. The British government has said it's on track to offer all U.K. adults a first dose before July 31. The latest research on vaccine sentiment, conducted in the U.K. by the University of Bristol, King's College London and the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emergency Preparedness and Response, found that 18% of people who haven't had a Covid vaccine yet say they'll feel resentful toward those who have if they don't receive one in time for their summer vacation — although a majority (58%) say they will not feel such resentment. The poll, of almost 5,000 British adults conducted between April 1-16 found that respondents from higher-income households are more likely to predict they'll feel a sense of resentment than lower income families: 24% of unvaccinated people from households earning more than £55,000 (around $76,700) a year say they'll feel resentful if not vaccinated in time for their vacation, compared with 14% of those who earn between £20,000 and £34,999. Those aged 18 to 44 (20%) who have not yet had the vaccine are twice as likely as those aged 45 and above (8%) to say they'll be resentful, which is likely to reflect the very different levels of vaccine coverage between the different age groups.  More generally, around one in eight unvaccinated people (12%) also say they currently feel resentful toward those who have had the vaccine. But far more — two-thirds (67%) — do not feel this way, the poll found. Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King's College London, said the poll showed that "there is very widespread support for the staged approach to vaccination in the U.K., getting to the oldest and most vulnerable first, as demonstrated by the fact that only 12% of the currently unvaccinated say they resent those who have been. This no doubt partly reflects the speed and efficiency of the vaccine rollout overall, as people can have confidence that they'll get their turn soon."  However, there are some clear limits to this, he added. "With the summer holiday season a key target many have in mind, and a potential test of our collective spirit if some are free to travel while others are not. Public faith in the equity and reliability of any vaccine passport system is going to need to be carefully encouraged."
European regulators said Friday that "Apple has a monopoly" in the distribution of music streaming apps to owners of Apple devices. The EU's executive arm opened an antitrust investigation into the App Store last year, after Spotify complained in 2019 about Apple's license agreements.	LONDON — Apple has "abused its dominant position" in the distribution of music streaming apps through its App Store, the European Commission said Friday. "Our preliminary finding is that Apple exercises considerable market power in the distribution of music streaming apps to owners of Apple devices. On that market, Apple has a monopoly," Margrethe Vestager, the head of competition policy in the EU, said in a press conference. The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, opened an antitrust investigation into the App Store last year, after the music streaming platform Spotify complained in 2019 about Apple's license agreements. The agreements mean that app developers have to pay a 30% commission on all subscription fees that come through the App Store. On Friday, the EU said it took issue with the "mandatory use of Apple's own in-app purchase mechanism imposed on music streaming app developers to distribute their apps via Apple's App Store." App developers are also unable to inform users of alternative ways to purchase the same apps elsewhere — another issue the commission said it was concerned with. "The European Commission has informed Apple of its preliminary view that it distorted competition in the music streaming market as it abused its dominant position for the distribution of music streaming apps through its App Store," it summarized in a "statement of objections" sent to Apple. In response, Apple said the EU's case was the "opposite of fair competition." "Spotify has become the largest music subscription service in the world, and we're proud of the role we played in that," Apple said a statement. "Once again, they want all the benefits of the App Store but don't think they should have to pay anything for that." A statement of objections is part of the formal process in an antitrust investigation, but it does not conclude the probe. Apple now has to reply to the commission's concerns either in writing or via a oral hearing. Spotify welcomed the news Friday. "The European Commission's Statement of Objections is a critical step toward holding Apple accountable for its anticompetitive behavior, ensuring meaningful choice for all consumers and a level playing field for app developers," Spotify's chief legal officer Horacio Gutierrez said in a statement. The decision comes after an e-book and audiobook distributor filed a similar complaint against Apple in March 2020, while Epic Games — which is already locking horns with Apple in a U.S. legal battle — filed an antitrust complaint against the iPhone maker with the European Commission earlier this year. At the press conference, Vestager stressed that app stores play a central role in today's digital economy. "(Apple) not only controls the only access to apps on Apple devices, it also offers a music streaming service, Apple Music, that competes with other apps available in the Apple App Store, such as Spotify or Deezer," Vestager said. She added that App Store rules are a concern for many app developers, "because they depend on Apple App Store as a gatekeeper to access users of Apple's iPhones and iPads." "This significant market power cannot go unchecked as the conditions of access to the Apple App Store are key for the success of app developers," Vestager said. The commission is also looking at Apple Pay, but Vestager did not say when this probe would be concluded. This is not the first investigation that the European Commission has brought against Apple. The commission decided in September to take Apple and the Irish government to the highest court in the European Union for what Brussels deems unfair taxation practices. The EU ruled in 2016 that Apple had to repay 13 billion euros ($15.7 billion) in unpaid taxes to the Irish government, after the latter granted "undue tax benefits." Apple and the Irish government have contested the decision and the case is still in court. Hoping to overcome long legal battles and make its markets fairer, the European Union is working on new regulation that could ultimately impact many of the U.S. tech giants. The Digital Markets Act is likely to end what's known as self-preferencing — when, for instance, app search results in an Apple product prioritize those developed by the tech giant. The idea is to give smaller app developers the same chance of being found and chosen by consumers. The legislation is still being discussed by European lawmakers. But apart from enforcing practical changes, it will also have the power to fine companies up to 10% of their worldwide annual turnover.
Rudy Giuliani sought to discredit the federal investigation into his dealings in Ukraine a day after agents raided his home and office. On his daily talk show on WABC Radio, Giuliani referred to prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which he used to run, as unaccomplished "bullies." The federal probe is examining Giuliani's ties to Ukraine and whether he violated a federal law that governs lobbying on behalf of foreign countries or entities.	Rudy Giuliani sought to discredit the federal investigation into his dealings in Ukraine on Thursday, a day after agents raided his home and office. Giuliani said the 6 a.m. search, which he said involved seven FBI agents, was unnecessary because he offered for two years to provide federal prosecutors his electronic devices and to "talk it over with them." "They won't explain to me what they're looking into for two years," Giuliani said in an evening appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight. Giuliani's lawyer, Robert Costello, has previously said proposed meetings between investigators and Giuliani's legal team didn't take place because prosecutors wouldn't agree to a precondition that they first disclose more about the probe. It would be rare for prosecutors to give up detailed information to a potential criminal defendant before charges are filed, or to rely on that person to voluntarily produce electronic files thought to contain incriminating evidence. The federal probe is examining Giuliani's interactions with Ukrainian figures and whether he violated a federal law that governs lobbying on behalf of foreign countries or entities. Giuliani, the Republican former mayor of New York City, has insisted that all of his activities in Ukraine were conducted on behalf of former President Donald Trump. At the time, Giuliani was leading a campaign to press Ukraine for an investigation into President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. But some Ukrainians who were in contact with Giuliani have said in interviews that they also hoped he could help them on matters in the U.S., including arranging meetings with the U.S. attorney general and ousting the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. The search warrants for Giuliani's electronic devices were approved by a federal judge. The agents who banged on his door this week took "seven or eight electronic items of mine and two of someone else's," Giuliani said. Giuliani said Thursday that federal prosecutors told his attorney they had accessed materials from his iCloud as early as 2019. "In the middle of the impeachment defense, they invaded, without telling me, my iCloud," he told Carlson, without providing details. Earlier in the day, Giuliani made his first public comments since the raid on his daily talk show on WABC Radio. On the air, he referred to prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which he used to run, as unaccomplished "bullies." "You're not going to stop me," he said on the program. "And you're not going to convict me of some phony crime." He then ticked off a list of his own accomplishments as the U.S. attorney in Manhattan in the 1980s, including prosecutions of mob figures and Wall Street fraudsters, and bashed the current prosecution team as having done nothing comparable. "What have they done? Nothing, except come after me ... at six o'clock in the morning with a piece of nonsense. No wonder they're jealous," Giuliani said. The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment. In the decades since Giuliani left, the office has handled some of the nation's most high-profile prosecutions, convicting global drug traffickers, corrupt politicians, Wall Street scammers and terrorists including the men behind the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday on CNN that the White House was given no heads' up on the fact the raid was coming. The Justice Department, she said, "is independent now. They're gonna make their own decisions, take their own actions. That's how the president wants it." Trump told Fox Business on Thursday that Giuliani was "the greatest mayor in the history of New York" and "a great patriot." "It's very, very unfair," he said of what happened Wednesday. "Rudy loves this country so much, it is so terrible when you see things that are going on in our country with the corruption and the problems and then they go after Rudy Giuliani."
Deutsche Post DHL, one of the world's biggest logistics companies, lifted its operating profit forecast to more than 6.7 billion euros ($8.05 billion) in 2021, and more than 7 billion in 2023. It previously forecast more than 5.6 billion for 2021.	German logistics company Deutsche Post raised its financial outlook again on Wednesday after more than tripling its operating earnings in the first quarter, predicting that ecommerce will keep booming and global trade will rebound. Deutsche Post DHL, one of the world's biggest logistics companies, lifted its operating profit forecast to more than 6.7 billion euros ($8.05 billion) in 2021, and more than 7 billion in 2023. It previously forecast more than 5.6 billion for 2021. First-quarter operating profit jumped to 1.9 billion euros on revenues up an organic 26% to 18.9 billion. Deutsche Post CEO Frank Appel told CNBC on Wednesday that the company was in the "sweet spot" with business-to-consumer activity still elevated due to remaining lockdowns and business-to-business sales picking up. Appel also said the persistent weak demand for intercontinental travel on passenger aircraft, which would typically carry a substantial amount of commercial freight, was benefiting Deutsche Post. "It takes definitely 2022 and maybe beyond until we see a full normalization, which of course helps companies like us who control more than 250 wide body freighters," Appel said. "That has helped us in the last couple of quarters and definitely will be a competitive advantage going forward." —CNBC's Elliot Smith contributed to this article.
European governments are unable to provide financial support to companies if this aid undermines fair competition. However, these rules have not been applied to foreign subsidies and the commission wants to change that. The proposal will now be discussed by European lawmakers and member states before becoming law.	LONDON — The European Union wants to restrict foreign companies that receive government subsidies from engaging in its market, potentially causing repercussions for Chinese-backed firms in particular. The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, proposed on Wednesday three new tools to enable it to have the power to investigate financial contributions given by public authorities from non-EU nations. This would happen when the recipient firm tries to participate in the European market. "We want every company that operates in Europe no matter where it comes from to respect our house rules," European competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, said during a press conference. The European Union does not allow European governments to provide financial support to companies if this aid undermines fair competition. However, the rules have left foreign subsidies off the hook for decades and the commission wants to change that. "Companies have been free to use foreign subsidies to buy up business here in Europe. Some have been able to undercut their competitors in public tenders not because they are more efficient, but because they get financial support from foreign countries and that's not fair towards those companies who don't get that kind of subsides," Vestager also said. State influence has often been discussed in the EU, but the ongoing pandemic has made the issue even more pressing as many businesses are struggling for cash. In addition, there's been a growing concern over Chinese firms who have been particularly active in the European market in the wake of the 2011 debt crisis. In 2016, Chinese tech giant Tencent bought a majority stake in Finnish mobile games maker Supercell, and Midea, a Chinese electrical appliance manufacturer, bought German robotics firm Kuka. Under the new proposal, the Brussels-based institution wants to check contributions where the EU-based turnover of the firm being acquired is at least 500 million euros ($600 million) and the foreign subsidy is at least 50 million euros. The commission also wants to investigate bids in public procurement processes, where the estimated value is 250 million euros or higher. Thus, firms that have received foreign support and are looking at taking over European companies will have to disclose how much they received and get the approval from the commission before going ahead with the deal. Failure to disclose the information may result in fines and a review of the transactions. In addition, the commission also wants to be able to start its own investigations when it suspects that a foreign subsidy has been granted but not divulged. The proposal will now be discussed by European lawmakers and member states before becoming law. Dutch State Secretary Mona Keijzer said in emailed remarks: "We want to continue doing business with countries and companies from outside the EU. That has always given us economic advantages and jobs. But this is only possible if that market is fair and not distorted by companies that enjoy unfair competitive advantages due to their home situation." Reinhard Bütikofer, a lawmaker at the European Parliament, welcomed the commission's proposal and said: "Past negligence in enforcing competitive neutrality vis-à-vis China has contributed to the fact that European industrial policy must now defend its own interests all the more resolutely in order to secure Europe's industrial future." 
The World Health Organization is to open a "Global Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence" in Germany. WHO says the center will focus on gathering data to predict and prevent future pandemics. The new global hub for pandemic and epidemic intelligence, data, surveillance and analytics will be based in Berlin.	The World Health Organization has announced plans for a "Global Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence" in Germany, which it says will help gather data to predict and prevent future pandemics. The new center for pandemic and epidemic intelligence, data, surveillance and analytics will be based in Berlin but will involve a global collaboration of countries and partners worldwide. The hub, due to officially open later this year, is envisaged as a way to create a large network of global data "to predict, prevent, detect prepare for and respond to  pandemic and epidemic risks worldwide," WHO said in a statement Wednesday. WHO Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday that "one of the lessons of Covid-19 is that world needs a significant leap forward in data analysis to help leaders make informed public health decisions." "This requires harnessing the potential of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, combining diverse data sources, and collaborating across multiple disciplines. Better data and better analytics will lead to better decisions," he noted at a press briefing announcing the creation of the hub. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a video message that the current Covid-19 pandemic "has taught us that we can only fight pandemics and epidemics together. The new WHO Hub will be a global platform for pandemic prevention, bringing together various governmental, academic and private sector institutions." She welcomed WHO's decision to base the hub in Berlin although the international public health body insisted that the hub would be a global collaboration of WHO's member countries and public and private sector organizations, academia, and international partner networks. Sourcing funding for the hub is still ongoing although the startup costs had been covered by Germany, Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said. German Minister of Health Jens Spahn commented that the world needs to "identify pandemic and epidemic risks as quickly as possible, wherever they occur in the world. For that aim, we need to strengthen the global early warning surveillance system with improved collection of health-related data and inter-disciplinary risk analysis." The Covid-19 pandemic first emerged in China in late 2019 and, to date, over 154 million cases have been reported worldwide. Over 3.2 million people have died worldwide, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The origin of the pandemic remains unclear and there were questions from journalists on Wednesday over how, and whether, the WHO could guarantee that data would be openly shared with the hub given continued speculation over the initial outbreak of Covid-19 and whether China delayed alerting the rest of the world to the presence of the new virus. Earlier this year, global experts gathered by the WHO and a team of Chinese officials investigated the source of the virus but did not come to any concrete conclusions. The WHO said that it was "most likely" that the virus originated in animals before spreading to humans and dismissed a theory that the disease could have been leaked by a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The team proposed further research in every area except the lab leak hypothesis.
Now expects operating margin of 5.5-7% in 2021 First quarter operating profit 4.9 billion euros versus 0.9 billion last year Shares indicated 1.2% higher	Volkswagen , Europe's largest car maker, raised its operating margin target for 2021 on Thursday, pointing to stronger demand for more profitable cars in the first three months of the year. The group now expects its operating profit margin to be 5.5-7% this year, versus a previous forecast for 5.0-6.5%, with vehicle deliveries and sales each up by more than a fifth. The better outlook is mainly driven by improved demand for high-margin premium cars such as Porsche and Audi, a trend that has also been observed by rivals General Motors, Daimler and Ford and Stellantis. "We started the year with great momentum and are on a strong operational course. This is clearly reflected in our positive quarterly figures," Volkswagen AG CEO Herbert Diess said. "Our successful e-offensive continues to gain momentum and we have significantly expanded it with attractive new models." Shares in the group were indicated to open 1.2% higher in pre-market trade. Volkswagen's operating profit came in at 4.9 billion euros ($5.9 billion) in the first quarter to March, helped by cost cuts and higher sales, versus 0.9 billion in the same period last year that was impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its improved outlook for the year comes even though the car maker expects the impact of an ongoing shortage of crucial automotive chips to intensify in the second quarter.
In recent years the United Kingdom has struggled to live up to its name. Tensions and old enmities have flared between the four nations that make up the kingdom, p[particularly since the Brexit vote in 2016. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have factions pushing for a break from the U.K.	LONDON — In recent years the United Kingdom has struggled to live up to its name, with tensions and old enmities flaring between the four nations that make up the kingdom — England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — and a resurgent threat that the union could disintegrate. Regional votes on Thursday could open those divides further and the parliamentary election taking place in Scotland could even set the stage for a second referendum on independence, although public opinion on the debate is on a knife-edge. How Nicola Sturgeon's Scottish National Party fares in the election could largely determine how easily it can galvanize public opinion and pursue another referendum. The party is predicted to achieve a narrow parliamentary majority in the vote, according to the latest polling for Sky News. The same polling carried out by Opinium also found that support for a second Scottish independence referendum remains divided at 50-50, once "don't knows" are excluded, down from 51-49 in the last Opinium poll. The poll sampled 1,015 Scottish voters between April 28 and May 3. Analysts said the outcome to watch for is whether the SNP, the staunchest advocate of independence, will need the support of the Green Party in its bid for a second independence vote. "They will remain in government with an anticipated 60-70 seats in the 129-seat (Scottish) parliament. The signpost to watch is whether the SNP will get the 65 seats required for an overall majority or whether they will have to rely on the Greens to provide an overall majority in favor of a second independence referendum," analysts at Teneo Intelligence noted Tuesday. "After the vote, PM Boris Johnson is likely to declare that 'now is not the time' for a second referendum, irrespective of the Scottish election result. In this way, Johnson will attempt to kick the can down the road until the end of this UK parliamentary term in late 2024." Sturgeon has dismissed claims she will hold a "wildcat" independence referendum if her party wins a majority in the parliament. During a Scottish leaders' debate, Sturgeon said her aim was to make the case for independence through persuasion and not through an unsanctioned plebiscite. Johnson, meanwhile, has called the SNP's plans to hold a second referendum "uncalled for and unnecessary." There are rumblings of discontent and calls for independence in other parts of the U.K., too. Arguably, the trend toward independence was boosted in the late 1990s when the process of devolution began. This meant that certain powers and responsibilities were devolved from the government in Westminster to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales (Scotland and Wales have their own Parliaments while Northern Ireland has an Assembly). On a practical level, devolution has meant that much of the decision-making that goes on in different parts of the U.K. is taken at that local level, although some policy areas, such as defense, immigration and foreign policy remain in the hands of lawmakers in Westminster. The leader of Plaid Cymru, a Welsh nationalist party, said in April that if the party won a majority in the parliamentary (or Senedd) elections on Thursday, it would commit to holding a referendum on Welsh independence during the next five years. Although opinion polls have typically showed that Plaid Cymru will land in third place in the elections, Yes Cymru, a group campaigning for independence, tweeted a poll in late April that suggested support for independence was increasing. Northern Ireland also remains a political tinder box for the U.K., with its citizens largely divided down religious and nationalist lines. Protestant voters tend to opt toward staunchly maintaining the union with the U.K., while Catholic voters traditionally support republican parties and reunification with the Republic of Ireland. The Brexit vote in 2016 was a catalyst for further divides in Britain. Scotland and Northern Ireland voted predominantly to remain in the EU, while a majority in Wales and England voted to leave. Complexities over Northern Ireland's role in the post-Brexit trade deal and a perception that it was sacrificed during the negotiating process with the EU have left some experts questioning whether a push toward reunification with the rest of Ireland could get stronger. Philip Rycroft, former permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU, has noted that a "complacent and un-strategic" approach to devolution has galvanized the push for Scottish independence and left the union once again on the brink. "Westminster, over time, has really not paid sufficient attention to what's going on in Scotland and you could argue, likewise, in Wales and Northern Ireland," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Wednesday. "The accusation is that Westminster and Whitehall had an approach of 'devolve and forget' and the handling of devolution did not get into the bloodstream of the U.K. system despite the huge changes that came with devolution in the '90s. So that has allowed the narrative to grow that the U.K. is not supportive of all its constituent parts." Strategists are looking at the impact the election results, particularly those from Scotland, could have on sterling , which could be closely watched as the election results emerge. Not everyone is convinced there will be sharp moves in the pound, just yet. ING developed markets economist James Smith and chief EMEA FX and IR strategist Petr Krpata noted on Tuesday that "although the Scottish election may bring back negative headline news about another Scottish independence referendum, we don't think this should have an overly negative impact on sterling." "This is because (a) a referendum could be years away rather than months (even if pro-independence parties win a majority); (b) as we observed with the Brexit referendum, the risk premium started to be built into GBP only six months ahead of the event; and (c) the first Scottish referendum in 2014 did not translate into a material build-up of GBP risk premium." Scottish independence is nowhere near a foregone conclusion. As with the last vote in 2014, which resulted in 44.7% of voters voting in favor of independence and 55.3% voting against the split, question marks over Scotland's economic viability as an independent nation remain unanswered. Rycroft says those questions are just as salient, and unresolved, in the current debate. "There is no doubt that an independent Scotland would face some huge economic challenges. The big overhang of the deficit, which was running pre-Covid at 8-9%, a lot higher than the U.K. as a whole and Brexit means that there would be a whole bunch of really tough questions over how to handle a potential border with the rest of the U.K., if Scotland sought to rejoin the EU. There's the big question of the currency — does it use the pound, create its own currency or ultimately go into the euro?," he noted. "At the end of the day, the debate about independence is about self-government and a sense of identity, and the challenge for the U.K. side of the debate is to persuade sufficient people in Scotland that being British as well as Scottish remains a viable long term option for them."
Supporters of the idea say it is critical to ramp up vaccination rates in low-income nations. Until now, the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, has expressed doubts about the waiving of the IP rights. "In the short run, however, we call upon all vaccine producing countries to allow export and to avoid measures that disrupt the supply chains," von der Leyen said on Thursday.	LONDON — The European Union has said it is ready to discuss the waiving of intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines, after the United States announced it supports the initiative . The proposed patent-waiver — designed to boost the global production of Covid-19 vaccines — has proved divisive for European lawmakers, with some supporting the move, while others have fiercely opposed it. Supporters of the idea say it is critical to ramp up vaccination rates in low-income nations. Until now, the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, has expressed doubts about the waiving of the IP rights. However on Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said her team was open "to discuss any proposals that address the crisis in an effective and pragmatic manner." "That is why we are ready to discuss how the U.S. proposal for a waiver on intellectual property protections for Covid-19 vaccines could help achieve that objective," she said during a speech. It comes after the White House announced Wednesday that it was in favour of lifting IP rights, citing the "extraordinary circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic." The move caused shares of major pharmaceutical firms that have developed Covid-19 shots to sink. However, the announcement was praised by the World Health Organization, with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying the U.S. decision was a "monumental moment in the fight against Covid-19." The GAVI vaccine alliance also welcomed President Joe Biden's stance, saying it recognizes "the significance of the administration's commitment to work towards increasing raw material production." The landmark proposal to waive the IP rights was jointly submitted to the World Trade Organization by India and South Africa in October, however, a handful of countries have blocked the proposal. These include the U.K., Switzerland, Japan, Norway, Canada, Australia, Brazil, the EU and — until now — the United States. "In the short run, however, we call upon all vaccine producing countries to allow export and to avoid measures that disrupt the supply chains," von der Leyen said on Thursday. The EU has praised itself for being the top exporter of Covid-19 vaccines, while also criticizing countries such as the U.K. for not taking similar action. "While others keep their vaccine production for themselves, Europe is the main exporter of vaccines worldwide. So far, more than 200 million doses of vaccines produced in Europe have been shipped to the rest of the world," von der Leyen said. The EU, a group of 27 nations, experienced a slow start to its vaccine rollout, however inoculations have steadily increased and the bloc is expecting to have 70% of its adults vaccinated by July. "The U.S. has a similar goal. This shows how much our vaccination campaigns have aligned," von der Leyen added. The latest data show that Israel, the U.K., the U.S and Chile are leading the way when it comes to the number of Covid-19 shots administered so far. However, the figures also show that inoculation rates in the EU are significantly above the world's average, which was not the case some weeks ago. 
The Russian Direct Investment Fund said the one-shot "Sputnik Light" Covid vaccine had an efficacy rate of 79.4% and would cost less than $10 a dose. RDIF said late-stage Phase III trials involving 7,000 people were underway in Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Ghana, among others. Interim results were expected later this month. As of Wednesday, RDIF said over 20 million people around the world had received their first dose of the Sputnik V vaccine.	LONDON — Russia on Thursday authorized the use of a one-shot coronavirus vaccine called "Sputnik Light," according to the country's sovereign wealth fund, a move designed to boost vaccine supplies in countries with surging infection rates. The Russian Direct Investment Fund said Sputnik Light, a slimmed-down vaccine developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Research Institute, has an efficacy rate of 79.4% and would cost less than $10 a dose. RDIF said the shot, the first component of the country's flagship two-dose Sputnik V vaccine, is compatible with standard vaccine storage and logistics requirements. It claims one of the potential uses of the single-shot vaccine is for the immunization of a larger number of people in a shorter time frame, noting it can be shipped at speed to a country in the midst of an acute outbreak. RDIF said late-stage Phase III trials involving 7,000 people were underway in Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Ghana, among other countries. Interim results were expected later this month. Phase I and Phase II results of the single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine found the shot demonstrated safety for all subjects and no serious adverse events were registered, it said. "The single dose regimen solves the challenge of immunizing large groups in a shorter time, which is especially important during the acute phase of the spread of coronavirus, achieving herd immunity faster," Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of RDIF, said in a statement. Dmitriev said that while Sputnik Light had "an affordable price" of under $10, the two-dose Sputnik V vaccine "remains the main source of vaccination in Russia." "The Sputnik Light vaccine will be exported to our international partners to help increase the rate of vaccinations in a number of countries in the face of the ongoing fight with the pandemic and new strains of coronavirus," he added. As of Wednesday, RDIF said over 20 million people around the world had received their first dose of the Sputnik V vaccine. "Sputnik Light will help to prevent the spread of coronavirus through the faster immunization of larger population groups, as well as supporting high immunity levels in those who have already been infected previously," Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology, said in a statement. "Sputnik Light offers strong value in initial vaccination and re-vaccination, as well as boosting efficacy when taken in combination with other vaccines."
France has long struggled with high levels of public debt and the pandemic has naturally made the situation worse. But ultimately analysts think it doesn't make a huge difference.	LONDON — Unlike other euro nations, France doesn't have any plans to significantly reduce its public debt in the near future. But market watchers and economists don't seem bothered. The second largest euro area economy predicts that its public debt ratio is likely to stand at 117.8% in 2021, and to fall only slightly to 116.3% in 2022. Estimates from Goldman Sachs suggest the French debt pile will remain at the same levels until at least 2024. "France stands out as the only large euro area country where we, and external forecasters, do not project a significant reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of our forecast horizon," analysts at the investment bank said in a note in April. "We expect French government debt of 116% in 2024, down only slightly from 2020 levels, while we look for a notable decline in Germany, from 71% to 68% and Italy from 156% to 151%," they added. France has long struggled with high levels of debt and the pandemic has naturally made the situation worse. Its long history of debt is one of the reasons why economists believe there won't be a massive improvement in the coming years. France has not seen a "consistent debt decline in decades," Sarah Carlson, senior vice president at Moody's, told CNBC on Tuesday. Data collected by the International Monetary Fund shows France's debt growing since 2010, when it stood at about 85% — above the EU's recommended threshold of below 60% of debt to GDP (gross domestic product). Jessica Hinds, economist at Capital Economics, said there are two main reasons why France has posted high levels of debt: It runs persistent primary budget deficits and its sluggish economic growth has made it harder for the government to reduce the debt burden. "Over 2010 to 2019 as a whole, France's borrowing costs have on average been a touch lower than nominal GDP growth between 2010 to 2019. But the persistent primary budget deficit (government borrowing) has meant that despite this the debt ratio has not fallen, it has merely stabilised at a high level," she said. In addition, Goldman Sachs also said that its research "has shown that over history French fiscal policy has tended to respond less to rising debt than other major euro area countries." This is likely to remain the case as the country gears up for a new presidential election next year and as the country keeps fighting the Covid-induced crisis. "We do not expect France to adopt a new fiscal rule until after next year's elections, as we think President Macron is unlikely to push through a fiscal consolidation agenda ahead of the election," Goldman Sachs said. But ultimately analysts think it doesn't make a huge difference that France is not focused on tackling its debt for now. This is because interest rates are low and fiscal stimulus is needed to address the economic crisis. "At this stage, I would be more worried about a premature return to austerity that could hold back the economic recovery rather than a slow reduction in the debt burden," Jessica Hinds, economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC via email. Carlson from Moody's, also said that "what matters is debt affordability" — the ratio of annual interest payments to keep a government's debt to its annual tax revenues. And she added that France is able to finance itself at cheaper prices now than back in 2015. The yield on the 10-year French government bond is currently trading at about 0.153% versus 1.2% at its 2015-peak.
Travel from the U.K. has been tightly restricted during the most severe months of a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. But from May 17, people in England will be allowed to visit certain countries, although some restrictions will still apply.	LONDON — British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps revealed on Friday the "green list" of countries that residents of England will soon be allowed to visit without having to quarantine on their return. Travel has been tightly restricted during the most severe months of a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. But from May 17, people in England will be allowed to visit certain countries, although some restrictions will still apply. Twelve countries will be on England's so-called "green list." Travelers to these countries will need to be tested pre-departure and on their return. But they will not need to quarantine on their return. The 12 countries are: Portugal Israel Gibraltar Australia New Zealand Singapore Brunei Iceland Faroe Islands Falkland Islands South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands St. Helena, Tristan de Cunha, Ascension Island Outside those 12, other nations have been divided into an "amber" and a "red" list — with the latter requiring the most stringent of measures. Turkey was one notable name added to the red list on Friday. Popular destinations for Brits, such as France and Spain, have not been placed on the green list at this stage. Shapps said at a press conference on Friday that green list countries can have their status withdrawn at any time. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will announce their own travel restrictions for their residents separately. British travelers also face other countries' travel restrictions, such as those in Australia and the United States. U.S. and European airlines and a host of travel industry companies, struggling from a slump in international travel, this week urged their governments to loosen travel rules that currently bar most Britons from entering, citing an increase in vaccination rates in their respective countries. "We continue to encourage the U.S. to implement a reciprocal policy that allows travelers who are fully vaccinated to travel to the U.S. from nations with similarly successful vaccination programs," said Airlines for America, a trade group that represents most large U.S. airlines, including American , Delta and United . Airline executives have cast doubt on a restoration of most U.S.-Europe travel this summer with restrictions still in place but have been more upbeat about the possibility of U.K.-U.S. travel reopening. U.S. airlines in recent weeks have announced new service to some destinations that have opened or plan to, such as Greece, Iceland and Croatia. — CNBC's  Leslie Josephs contributed reporting from New York.
Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon said she would push ahead with plans for a new independence referendum after results showed her party would win an election to Scotland's parliament, albeit without a majority. The results of the election mean the SNP together with the Scottish Greens will hold a significant pro-independence majority in the parliament.	Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon said she would push ahead with plans for a new independence referendum after results showed her party would win an election to Scotland's parliament, albeit without a majority. Results on Saturday showed Scottish National Party and the Scottish Greens had won 65 of the 87 seats so far declared for the 129-seat parliament. The results of the election mean the SNP together with the Scottish Greens will hold a significant pro-independence majority in the parliament. "In normal democratic debate, parties that promise something in an election and get elected are made to deliver on those commitments," Sturgeon told BBC TV. "It is an absurdity that in Scotland we seem to have other parties determined to block the party or parties that have won the mandate."
Khan, a former member of parliament who replaced Johnson as leader of the British capital with a population of almost nine million people, has faced criticism over rising violent crime in the capital, particularly stabbings involving teenagers. His record on the issue and other security issues led to a series of angry Twitter spats with former U.S. President Donald Trump.	Sadiq Khan was re-elected London Mayor on Saturday as had been widely expected, providing some joy to the opposition Labour Party which has suffered a series of disappointing results in other local elections. Khan, who became the first Muslim to head a major Western capital after his victory in 2016, saw off his main challenger, Shaun Bailey, the candidate from Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party. He won by 55.2% to Bailey's 44.8% in a result which had been widely predicted, although his winning margin was smaller than his victory five years ago. "I am deeply humbled by the trust Londoners have placed in me to continue leading the greatest city on earth," Khan said, who focused his campaign on creating jobs and boosting London's tourism economy. "I promise to strain every sinew to help build a better and brighter future for London after the dark days of the pandemic." Khan, a former member of parliament who replaced Johnson as leader of the British capital with a population of almost nine million people, has faced criticism over rising violent crime in the capital, particularly stabbings involving teenagers. His record on the issue and other security issues led to a series of angry Twitter spats with former U.S. President Donald Trump. Khan's success comes after a bruising set of results for Labour in local elections in its former heartlands in central and northern England - known as the party's "Red Wall" - which followed a disastrous performance in the 2019 national vote. While Johnson has enjoyed wide success elsewhere in England, the opposition party has become increasingly dominant in the British capital. Analysts attribute this to the city's younger, more ethnically-diverse and more pro-European Union population, which unlike most of England, overwhelmingly opposed Brexit.
The U.S. is using legislation to ensure that vaccines produced in the country are sent abroad only when it's established that there are sufficient doses to inoculate the American population. The latest data from the European Commission shows that out of the 400 million doses produced in the bloc, 200 million have been exported to 90 countries.	LONDON — European leaders have doubts that waiving intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines, a proposal recently supported by the United States, is the way to go. Instead, they have criticized the U.S. for not exporting Covid shots. "It is not really a matter of intellectual property rights. You can give the intellectual property to labs that do not know how to produce (the vaccine) and they won't be able to produce it overnight," French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters on Friday ahead of a European meeting, according to CNBC translation. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: "I made clear here already that I don't believe that releasing patents is the solution to provide vaccines for more people." However, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday welcomed the U.S. decision to back vaccine patent waivers. "It is a good initiative, but I don't think it is enough," he said in Porto, Portugal, while also advocating for production and distribution to be scaled up. President Joe Biden surprised his European counterparts last week by announcing the U.S. administration was in favor of lifting IP rights for Covid vaccines , citing the "extraordinary circumstances" of the pandemic. Health experts, human rights groups and international medical charities argue it is critical to waive IP rights to urgently address global vaccine scarcity amid the pandemic and, ultimately, avoid prolonging the health crisis. Vaccine makers, however, say this could disrupt the flow of raw materials, while also leading to lower investments on health research from smaller biotech innovators. India and South Africa initially submitted a joint proposal at the World Trade Organization in October to waive IP rights on Covid vaccines. The proposal, known as the TRIPS waiver, has been blocked by a some high-income nations, such as the U.K., Switzerland, Japan, Norway, Canada, Australia, Brazil, the EU and — until last week — the U.S. Macron insisted that the best way to increase global vaccination rates is for vaccine-producing nations to step up their exports. "Today the Anglo-Saxons are blocking a lot of these ingredients and vaccines. Today 100% of the vaccines produced in the United States of America go to the American market," he said, while adding that the Europeans "are the most generous" on this front. The U.S. does not have an outright ban on exports of Covid shots, but it is using legislation to ensure that vaccines produced in the country are sent abroad only when it's established that there are sufficient doses to inoculate the American population. The latest data from the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, shows that out of the 400 million doses produced in the bloc so far, 200 million have been exported to 90 countries. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also said that exporting vaccines "is the best way right now, in the short term, to approach the bottlenecks and the lack vaccines worldwide." "We should be open to this discussion. We should also, for example, have a close look at the role of licensing. These are important topics to discuss. But we should be aware of the fact that these are topics for the long term," von der Leyen said Saturday.
Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and its affiliated Bavarian party, the Christian Social Union, saw their popularity fall to 23% in the latest voter poll conducted by Kantar for the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. The Green Party remained in the lead with 26%, albeit with its rating also down 1 point from the previous week.	Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling conservative alliance has seen its popularity ratings hit an all-time low, deepening an apparent shift in voter trends in Germany. Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and its affiliated Bavarian party, the Christian Social Union, saw their popularity fall to 23% in the latest voter poll conducted by Kantar for the Bild am Sonntag newspaper . The survey of 1,910 Germans showed support for Merkel's CDU-CSU bloc had fallen yet again, from 24% the previous week to hit its lowest level in the history of the weekly poll. The Green Party remained in the lead with 26% of the vote, albeit with its rating also down 1 percentage point from the week before. In third place, with 16%, was the Social Democratic Party, the current junior coalition partner with the CDU-CSU. The center-left SPD announced Sunday that the Finance Minister Olaf Scholz will lead its election campaign. So he will be facing the Greens' Annalena Baerbock and the center-right CDU-CSU's candidate Armin Laschet in the race to replace Merkel in September's vote. In a show of just how much voter trends are changing, the Green Party has gone from being a fringe movement to a contender to lead government. If current opinion polls are borne out in the election, the Greens will lead Germany's government with a likely a coalition partner or two. Deutsche Bank economists led by Stefan Schneider noted that when it comes to coalition options, "nothing is impossible (at least arithmetically)." "The nominations of Annalena Baerbock and Armin Laschet as chancellor candidates have clearly helped the Greens to gain ground. They might not only be the kingmaker for the next government, but could now even appoint the next chancellor. The current shift in voters' sentiment allows for a whole bunch of coalition options," the economists said in a note Friday. Deutsche Bank's economists said they continue to attach a marginally higher probability to a black-green government (a CDU-CSU led coalition with the Greens) versus a Greens-led traffic light coalition with the SPD and the Liberals (the FDP party). Only the right-wing AfD has been ruled out as a partner by all the others. "It remains to be seen whether the honeymoon of Mrs. Baerbock and the German voters will last until election day in September, as the Green chancellor candidate now needs to explain to the voters how exactly she wants to achieve her policy proposals," they added. The departure of Merkel after four terms in office is heralding a shift in German politics. But the coronavirus crisis also might have shaped a fall from grace for the CDU-CSU bloc over its handling of the pandemic — a challenge for any government. While Germany's initial handling of the public health crisis was praised — it managed to keep the initial spread relatively under control with a robust track and trace system and modern hospital infrastructure that kept deaths low — it has faltered as a third wave of infections swept through Europe earlier this year. In addition, the country's vaccination drive has been sluggish. Only 9.7% of Germany's adult population has received two doses of a coronavirus vaccine, with 34.3% having received at least one dose, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control . France, Spain and Italy have given two doses to a higher percentage of people, ECDC data shows. From Sunday, Germany has loosened restrictions for vaccinated individuals or those who have recently recovered from Covid, meaning that social-contact rules, quarantining following travel and a nighttime curfew no longer apply to those individuals. To date, Germany has recorded over 3.5 million infections and 84,844 Covid deaths, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce that the government will push ahead with the next stage of lifting lockdown in England. A renewed bid for an independence vote in Scotland threatens to overshadow Westminster in the weeks and months ahead, however.	LONDON — U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce on Monday that the government will push ahead with the next stage of lifting lockdown in England. Johnson's Cabinet is expected to sign off on Monday the further relaxing of lockdown measures to begin May 17. International travel would be able to resume next Monday in most circumstances, although quarantines and testing would be required on return to the U.K., for the most part. Pubs and restaurants are also due to welcome customers indoors again, and indoor household mixing will be allowed to resume for groups up to six people. The government has said it hopes to lift all restrictions on social contact by June 21. Johnson is expected to say later Monday that the data supports a further relaxation of measures and that the public could be advised on whether more close personal contact with friends and family, such as hugging, is allowed, the BBC reported. Around midday Monday, the U.K.'s chief medical officers agreed to lower the country's Covid-19 alert level from 4 — which means Covid transmission is high or rising exponentially — to level 3, which means the epidemic is in general circulation. "Thanks to the efforts of the UK public in social distancing and the impact we are starting to see from the vaccination programme, case numbers, deaths and Covid hospital pressures have fallen consistently," the U.K.'s four chief medical officers said in a joint statement , although they called on the public to remain vigilant. The expected announcement on a further lifting of lockdown comes at a time when a political storm is brewing in the north after Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon vowed on Saturday to press ahead with plans for a new referendum on independence from the U.K. The comments by the leader of the Scottish National Party came after her party finished just one seat short of winning an overall majority in Scottish parliamentary elections last Thursday. The party is expected to call on the Scottish Green Party, another pro-independence party, for support when it comes to calling for another referendum. Johnson has said he would try to block a second referendum on independence, but Sturgeon has insisted the election result showed there was a mandate for a second vote. "The only people who can decide the future of Scotland are the Scottish people, and no Westminster politician can or should stand in the way of that," Sturgeon told the BBC on Sunday. A vote in favor of independence is not a foregone conclusion. In the last vote in 2014, 44.7% of voters opted for independence and 55.3% voted against the split, and question marks over Scotland's economic viability as an independent nation remain unanswered. The Brexit vote in 2016 was a catalyst for divides in Britain . Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, while a majority in Wales and England voted to leave. Complexities over Northern Ireland's role in the post-Brexit trade deal and a perception that it was sacrificed during the negotiating process with the EU have left some experts questioning whether a push toward reunification with the rest of Ireland could get stronger.
Indoor facilities such as move theaters and hotels will reopen, but with some capacity limits in place. Pubs and restaurants will be allowed to welcome customers inside again. Indoor household mixing will be allowed to resume for groups of up to six people. People will also be able to meet outdoors in groups of up to 30 people.	LONDON — U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed Monday that England will be moving to the next stage of its coronavirus lockdown easing program on May 17. Indoor facilities such as movie theaters and hotels will reopen, but with some capacity limits in place. Pubs and restaurants will be allowed to welcome customers inside again, and indoor household mixing will be allowed to resume for groups of up to six people. People will also be able to meet outdoors in groups of up to 30 people. Johnson said social distancing rules will remain for public places, but people can make their own judgement in private. When asked about hugging, Johnson said at a news conference Monday, "People should do it if you think it's appropriate, if you think the risks are very very low." "But you should exercise care and common sense. And clearly with unvaccinated people there must be a greater risk of transmission than with those who have had vaccination," he added. Johnson was heavily criticized for the initial response to the coronavirus pandemic , and with more than 127,000 reported fatalities, Britain has one of the worst death rates in Europe and the world. But Johnson has also been at the forefront of a successful vaccination campaign, with more than 50% of the country's population now having received at least one dose of a vaccine. International travel is able to resume next Monday in most circumstances, although quarantines and testing would be required on return to the U.K., for the most part.

The SNP fell one seat short of an absolute majority, winning 64 of the 129 seats available in the Scottish Parliament, but were able to form a pro-independence coalition with the Scottish Greens. The key question is whether U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government will block the request for a second independence referendum, which would likely lead to a lengthy court fight. The last independence referendum in 2014 saw Scots vote 55% to 45% to stay in the union, but the U.K. has since left the EU despite Scotland voting 62% to remain.	Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already set her sights on another referendum on independence from the U.K. after her Scottish National Party won a fourth term in power. The SNP fell one seat short of an absolute majority, winning 64 of the 129 seats available in the Scottish Parliament, but were able to form a pro-independence coalition with the Scottish Greens, setting up a constitutional battle between Holyrood and the U.K. government in Westminster. Sturgeon vowed to hold another vote within the first half of her new five-year Scottish parliamentary term. However, the key question is whether U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government will block this request, a move the Scottish nationalists would then likely challenge in the courts. The last independence referendum in 2014 saw Scots vote 55% to 45% to stay in the union, but the U.K. has since left the EU despite Scotland voting 62% to remain. Johnson, a key figurehead of the Brexit vote, remains unpopular north of the border. Berenberg Senior Economist Kallum Pickering noted that with polling indicating that the once-consistent majority for Scotland to remain in the union has narrowed since Johnson took office, he may use his 80-seat majority in the U.K. Parliament to refuse a second Scottish referendum and avoid becoming the prime minister who oversaw the fall of a 300-year union. The Scottish Parliament was established in its capital city of Edinburgh in 1999 after the Scottish electorate voted in favor of a devolved legislature, and exercises power over all areas of policymaking that are not "reserved" for the U.K. Parliament under the Scotland Act 1998. However, Westminster retains the power to amend the Scottish Parliament's terms of reference and to extend or reduce its jurisdiction. "My hunch is that Boris Johnson, arch Brexiteer, a Brexit Conservative party, probably don't think they have a very good chance of winning in a second Scottish independence referendum, and hence what they'll probably do is refuse a referendum if it's asked and force a noisy stalemate, where really nothing will change, there'll be lots of noise and markets really should just look through it — it won't have any serious economic effects," Pickering told CNBC on Friday. Pickering noted that the British government will expect the Supreme Court to back the decision of the U.K. Parliament. He suggested that this would be the best outcome for Westminster until another Scottish Parliament election or a U.K. general election offers an opportunity to dent pro-independence parties, or polling shifts decisively against independence. Conservative politicians have already begun setting out their case against holding another independence vote, with cabinet minister Michael Gove arguing that a "divisive" referendum would divert attention from the pandemic recovery, including jobs and health care. Although reiterating that she will not seek a public vote until "after the crisis," Sturgeon has said the question of whether the U.K. government will permit a second referendum is "predicated on a lack of basic respect for Scottish democracy." Pickering noted that should the Scottish nationalists attempt to hold an illegal vote in the event that the Supreme Court does take the side of the U.K. Parliament, it would likely be boycotted by pro-unionist Scots and widely disregarded as illegitimate, undermining their efforts. In the unlikely case that Westminster does green light a referendum, however, the risk of a break-up of the U.K. would rise, with current polling on independence too close to call. "While Scotland makes up only a fraction of U.K. GDP (c7%), a hard land border between England and a Scotland that rejoined the EU would exacerbate the economic damage from Brexit significantly," Pickering said. "In addition, the serious reputational damage to the U.K. on top of many years of uncertainty as lawyers unravel the 300+ year union between Scotland and England would further hurt the U.K.'s attractiveness as a destination for international investment." Johnson has called a summit of Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish first ministers to discuss a collaborative approach to Covid recovery. Meanwhile, Conservatives have been highlighting the benefits to Scotland of the U.K.'s vaccine rollout and policies such as the furlough scheme, sticking to a narrative of unity in crisis. However, as the U.K. emerges from the shadow of the pandemic and some sense of political normalcy is restored, this approach is likely to have a "limited shelf-life," according to Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group. "Johnson and Sturgeon are now at the start of a game of constitutional chess but neither is keen to make the first move," Rahman said in a research note Sunday. "Both know the crunch issue of a referendum is likely to end up in the Supreme Court but neither wants to take the first step towards that outcome." He suggested that Johnson's instinct would be to delay the referendum until after the next U.K. general election slated for 2024, but which Rahman said is increasingly likely to be called in 2023, with the current strength of Conservative support leading pundits to expect the prime minister will look to consolidate another five-year term. The SNP currently holds 44 of Scotland's 59 Westminster seats, and any reduction of that may enable Conservatives to tout a rejection of Sturgeon's referendum mandate. U.K. ministers' legal advisors believe that their trump card will be the Scotland Act 1998, which created the Scottish Parliament, which dictates that the constitution is a "reserved matter" for Westminster, according to Rahman. However, he said SNP strategists had been buoyed by the court's intervention in cases on Brexit and Johnson's suspension of Parliament in 2019, and believe the court fight is wide open. "They will argue that a referendum itself does not change the constitution because the change would depend on the result," Rahman predicted, noting that Sturgeon may hold an "advisory referendum" to test the national mood. Should it show support for independence, she could then leverage this to force the U.K. government's hand. "In their initial skirmishes, Johnson and Sturgeon are both proceeding cautiously as they stake out their ground; they know their battle will likely take years to resolve," said Rahman, noting that one U.K. government source had acknowledged that "it is going to be a long game."
The EU launched Sunday the Conference on the Future of Europe. Anti-EU lawmakers strengthened their support following the sovereign debt and migration crises of the last decade. Although, this seems to have now diminished somewhat. Nonetheless, the presence of anti-EU parties across the region is still very much a reality. This is evident in the upcoming presidential election in France, where far-right leader Marine le Pen is currently polling neck-a-neck with the incumbent Macron.	 LONDON — In the face of rising anti-EU sentiment, French President Emmanuel Macron in 2019 called for a new citizen-led vision for the region. Two years on, Brussels is making good on Macron's idea. The EU launched Sunday the Conference on the Future of Europe — a platform where any EU citizen can make suggestions on how the political bloc should change. The initiative also includes public discussions across the 27 member nations and a citizens' panels — where participants are chosen randomly, organized by the EU institutions. Critics argue that the project doesn't go far enough, whereas supporters describe it as a brave act of institutional reform. "Some people are challenging what we are about, who we are, and just forgetting everything we built up. That's what's at stake today, that's the risk to just giving up, not knowing what to do rather than to build," Macron said at the event launch on Sunday. Anti-EU lawmakers strengthened their support following the sovereign debt and migration crises of the last decade. Although, this seems to have now diminished somewhat. An opinion poll published in January showed that the desire among EU citizens to leave the European Union has decreased in recent years. The study conducted by YouGov looked at data since June 2016 — when the U.K. voted to leave the political bloc — and January 2020. In addition, citizens surveyed in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden and Finland also became more optimistic about the future of the bloc during that time. Nonetheless, the presence of anti-EU parties across the region is still very much a reality. This is evident in the upcoming presidential election in France , where far-right leader Marine le Pen is currently polling neck-a-neck with the incumbent Macron. There are also unanswered questions about how the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent economic crisis will shape sentiment among voters. Luis Garicano, a liberal member of the European Parliament, told CNBC that the EU is facing "two huge tests," citing the Covid-19 vaccination campaign and the fiscal stimulus that aims to combat the economic crisis. "And the jury is still out," he said, on how voters will assess the importance of the EU in these two areas. At elections in 2019, the majority of the seats in the European Parliament remained pro-EU despite a surge for populist lawmakers. But the chamber became a lot more divided, with the usual center-right and center-left blocs falling well short of a majority and needing other pro-EU parties to pass legislation. With the next EU election due in 2024, Garicano said the "the EU is really on trial" and that "it could be difficult" to keep the pro-EU majority in Parliament at the next election, if there are issues with the distribution of the coronavirus stimulus. The Conference on the Future of Europe is due to be concluded by spring 2022, with its proposals expected to then guide the work of the European institutions in the coming years. Some experts argue that ultimately the goal should be to update European laws in what's referred to as treaty change. However, this is a very complex exercise and requires consensus among the 27 nations. "Contrary to conventional wisdom, the Conference's success should not be measured against its ability to prompt Treaty change. Rather, its success will depend on its ability to mainstream new substantive policy ideas and institutionalize democratic innovations, such as citizen's assemblies, and to do so at the transnational level," Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law at H.E.C. Business School, told CNBC. "Once the genie will be out, it will be difficult to put him back into the bottle," he said, expecting more citizen participation going forward. 
Beirut is still reeling from a port explosion that killed over 200 people and injured more than 6,000 last August. The investigation into the blast remains inconclusive nine months later. Lebanon is facing its worst crisis since its bloody civil war of 1975-1990. Its currency has lost 90% of its value over the last 18 months on the informal market, and food inflation has reached 400%.	The current mismanagement of Lebanon has put it on "train to hell" which is "about to reach the last station," Henri Chaoul, a former advisor to the country's finance ministry, told CNBC. Chaoul, who had advised the government in its talks with the International Monetary Fund, resigned in June last year after Lebanon failed to make the reforms necessary to qualify for IMF assistance. "This is not the government that will be good for the future of Lebanon," Chaoul said. "It is clear that the old business model, the old model of governance in Lebanon has completely failed on many levels," Chaoul added. "We need to be able to rebuild." And Beirut is a city desperate to rebuild, with it still reeling from a port explosion that killed over 200 people and injured more than 6,000 last August . The investigation into the blast remains inconclusive nine months later. Lebanon is facing its worst crisis since its bloody civil war of 1975-1990. Its currency has lost 90% of its value over the last 18 months on the informal market, and food inflation has reached 400%. The country has also been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with over 533,000 cases and over 7,500 deaths. Only 7 % of the population has received the vaccine to date. Subsidies on essential items like medicine, food and fuel are beginning to be withdrawn in order to restore the country's dwindling foreign reserves. The temporary government of Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Hasan Diab is hoping to implement a cash card program to help citizens make ends meet. A source close to the cabinet told CNBC Tuesday that "the position of the prime minister is that it is essential the card program be instituted before any subsidies are removed." The source added that the "mechanism of instituting a card program is complex to design and implement, and the funding of the card program has to come from the Banque Du Liban." Without a proper government in place, Lebanon cannot move forward and make the reforms necessary to unlock the aid it desperately needs. The small Mediterranean country of nearly 7 million is on its third prime minister designate in a year after Diab resigned in the wake of the Beirut explosion. His successor, Mustapha Adib, resigned a month later. Diab's caretaker government will likely remain in place until three-time premier Saad Hariri can form a new legislative, with talks currently still in deadlock over its composition. Hariri declined to comment on this article when contacted by CNBC. For many across the country, there is no hope for change. "We need to see a silver lining in this crisis and build a new social contract so that the young of Lebanon decide to stay in Lebanon and build their future," Chaoul told CNBC. "There is no hope in Lebanon today." France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian threatened to sanction politicians responsible for the deadlock in a visit to Beirut last week, and warned against "collective suicide" if the country continues to fail to form a government. Paris has put measures in place to restrict entry to France for Lebanese officials hindering the country's political progress. Riad Salameh, the country's central bank governor , also faces corruption allegations in France over foreign investments, and is being investigated by Swiss prosecutors over suspected embezzlement and money laundering tied to the Banque du Liban. Salameh maintains his wealth was acquired prior to taking his position as central bank governor in 1993, and his lawyer, Pierre-Olivier Sur, told CNBC that his client had been scapegoated.  
Economists polled by Reuters had expected GDP to shrink by 1.7%, with stringent restrictions having been in place throughout the first three months of the year. The International Monetary Fund expects U.K. GDP to grow 5.3% in 2021, partially recovering from last year when the economy saw its largest annual contraction since the Great Frost of 1709.	LONDON — The U.K. economy contracted by 1.5% in the first quarter of 2021 as nationwide lockdown measures continued to weigh on activity, preliminary estimates revealed on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected GDP to shrink by 1.7%, with stringent restrictions having been in place throughout the first three months of the year as the country tried to contain spiraling Covid-19 cases. However, with lockdown measures now being phased out and the economy reopening, the country is expected to see a sharp rebound for the remainder of the year. The International Monetary Fund expects U.K. GDP to grow 5.3% in 2021, partially recovering from last year when the economy saw its largest annual contraction since the Great Frost of 1709. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Monday that the next stage of lockdown easing will go ahead as planned on May 17, with international travel permitted in most circumstances and hospitality venues allowed to welcome customers indoors, a lifeline for the country's dominant services industry. The economy grew 2.1% month-on-month in March, slightly exceeding expectations, and the level of GDP now sits 8.7% below its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2019, according to the Office for National Statistics. On a year-on-year basis, GDP shrank by 6.1% in the first quarter. Both services and production output contracted over the first quarter, but construction output grew.
The U.K. government unveiled a new law that would levy big fines against social media companies if they fail to stamp out online abuses. The Online Safety Bill seeks to strengthen the right to freedom of expression, and ensure democratic political debate is protected. The bill will place a duty of care on social media firms and websites to ensure they take swift action to remove illegal and abusive content.	Britain said on Wednesday a planned new law would see social media companies fined up to 10% of turnover or 18 million pounds ($25 million) if they failed to stamp out online abuses such as racist hate crimes, while senior managers could also face criminal action. The Online Safety Bill also seeks to strengthen the right to freedom of expression, and ensure democratic political debate and journalistic content is protected, the government said. "It's time for tech companies to be held to account and to protect the British people from harm. If they fail to do so, they will face penalties," interior minister Priti Patel said. Tech firms have been accused of doing far too little to address online abuse, with soccer clubs and other sporting authorities boycotting the world's biggest social media platforms last month to highlight the growing problem. The bill will place a duty of care on social media firms and websites to ensure they take swift action to remove illegal content, such as hate crimes, harassment and threats directed at individuals, including abuse which falls below the criminal threshold. There will also be a requirement to remove and limit the spread of terrorist material, suicide content and child sexual abuse, which they would need to report to the authorities. Those companies which fail to do so face hefty fines from regulator Ofcom which can also block access to their sites. "The draft Bill contains reserved powers for Ofcom to pursue criminal action against named senior managers whose companies do not comply with Ofcom's requests for information," the government said. "These will be introduced if tech companies fail to live up to their new responsibilities." The proposed law will also require companies to safeguard freedom of expression, and reinstate material unfairly removed. It will also forbid tech firms from discriminating against particular political viewpoints, and Ofcom will hold them to account for the arbitrary removal of journalistic content, the government added.
The Brussels-based institution now foresees a gross domestic product rate of 4.2% for the EU in 2021, and of 4.4% for next year. In February, it said GDP would be 3.7% this year and 3.9% in 2022. The prospects for the 19 countries that share the euro have also improved. Growth is now estimated at 4.3% this year, instead of 3.8% as forecast in February. The European Central Bank said in March that GDP would reach 4% in the euro area this year.	LONDON — The European economy looks like it will shine a little brighter this year. The European Commission presented Wednesday a more upbeat assessment of how the 27 economies will perform this year, citing an improved vaccination campaign and the expectation that EU-wide fiscal stimulus will kick in the second half of 2021. The Brussels-based institution now foresees a gross domestic product rate of 4.2% for the EU in 2021, and of 4.4% for next year. In February, it said GDP would be 3.7% this year and 3.9% in 2022. The prospects for the 19 countries that share the euro have also improved. Growth is now estimated at 4.3% this year, instead of 3.8% as forecast in February. The European Central Bank said in March that GDP would reach 4% in the euro area this year. "The shadow of Covid-19 is beginning to lift from Europe's economy," European Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni said in a statement, adding that the "unprecedented fiscal support has been — and remains — essential in helping Europe's workers and companies." "And of course, maintaining the now strong pace of vaccinations in the EU will be crucial — for the health of our citizens as well as our economies," Gentiloni also said. The latest forecasts come at an important moment for many EU nations as they announce — or in some cases, implement — a lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. Greece is welcoming tourists from Friday onward. Belgium said on Tuesday that it intends to end almost all restrictions on June 9. The land border between Portugal and Spain has also reopened. These are just some examples of how the economies are opening up ahead of the summer season, when many tourism-dependent nations will be hoping to attract more foreign visitors than last year. However, there are structural issues still to address. As a result of the vast level of government support in the wake of the pandemic, the Commission expects the aggregate EU ratio of public debt-to-GDP to peak at 94% this year, before falling slightly next year. But, this number masks the individual picture. Greece's public debt pile is set to reach 209% this year, Italy's at 160%, and France's at 117.4%. The European Commission, however, recognizes that the outlook is uncertain. "The risks surrounding the outlook are high and will remain so as long as the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic hangs over the economy," the institution said in a statement. There are concerns about how the virus might mutate and whether vaccines will continue to prove efficient. But there are also worries about how much consumers will be willing to spend in the coming months and when to dial back stimulus policies.
The EU's general court said the European Commission failed to prove that Luxembourg had given Amazon an illegal tax advantage. It was the court's second such ruling against the commission in less than a year. In July, it said the EU's team led by Margrethe Vestager failed to prove that the Irish government had given a tax advantage to Apple.	LONDON — Amazon on Wednesday won its appeal against the European Commission, which had ordered the U.S. tech giant to pay back 250 million euros ($303 million) in taxes to Luxembourg. The EU's general court said that the commission, the EU's executive arm, had failed to prove that there was an illegal tax advantage given to Amazon by Luxembourg — where the U.S. firm has its European subsidiary. The Brussels-based commission had said in 2017 that Luxembourg had granted undue tax benefits to Amazon. The commission said at the time that Amazon was allowed to pay four times less tax than other local companies subject to the same national rules. However, Amazon contested that assessment. "We welcome the Court's decision, which is in line with our long-standing position that we followed all applicable laws and that Amazon received no special treatment," a spokesperson for the company told CNBC via email on Wednesday. Europe's competition chief Margrethe Vestager said: "We will carefully study the judgment and reflect on possible next steps." The institution can decide to appeal the court ruling and take the case to the EU's highest court. It was the court's second such ruling against the commission in less than a year. In July, the court said the EU's team, led by Margrethe Vestager, failed to prove that the Irish government had given a tax advantage to Apple . The commission had ordered Apple to repay some 13 billion euros in unpaid taxes in 2016. The commission has since decided to take this case to the European Court of Justice , while at the same time studying ways on how to sharpen up its toolkit to combat what it describes as unfair market competition. In this context, European lawmakers are debating two legislative proposals that could bring about sweeping changes. Under these proposals, the EU's aim is to enforce remedies that will lead to practical changes, rather than fining those that constantly breach the rules.
Preliminary data from the so-called "Com-COV" study found that volunteers receiving alternating doses were more likely to develop mild to moderate symptoms. Some of those symptoms reported among participants receiving a mixed vaccine schedule included chills, fatigue, feverishness, headache, joint pain, malaise, muscle ache and pain at the injection site. The adverse reactions were found to be short-lived and there were no other safety concerns.	LONDON — A major U.K. trial assessing the benefits of mixing and matching Covid-19 vaccines has found that volunteers receiving alternating doses were more likely to develop mild to moderate symptoms. The so-called " Com-COV " study, hailed as a " world-first " by the U.K. government and led by the University of Oxford, is examining the immune responses of trial participants given a dose of the Oxford- AstraZeneca vaccine followed by the Pfizer - BioNTech shot — and vice versa. It reported on Wednesday that preliminary data shows participants receiving a mixed schedule of Covid-19 vaccines incurred more frequent reactions than those on standard non-mixed schedules. Some of the mild to moderate symptoms reported among participants receiving a mixed vaccine schedule included chills, fatigue, feverishness, headache, joint pain, malaise, muscle ache and pain at the injection site. The adverse reactions were found to be short-lived and there were no other safety concerns. The data was recorded among participants aged 50 years and above. Researchers of the study said this means there is a possibility that adverse reactions to a mixed schedule of Covid-19 vaccines may be more prevalent in younger age groups. It is thought that a mixed dosing schedule could lead to an increase in work absences the day after immunization against the coronavirus. In a peer-reviewed research letter published in The Lancet international medical journal on Wednesday, researchers of the trial reported that when given at a four-week interval, both of the alternating vaccine schedules of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine induced more frequent reactions following the second dose than the standard non-mixed schedules. "Whilst this is a secondary part of what we are trying to explore through these studies, it is important that we inform people about these data, especially as these mixed-doses schedules are being considered in several countries," Matthew Snape, associate professor in Paediatrics and Vaccinology at the University of Oxford, said in a statement. "The results from this study suggest that mixed dose schedules could result in an increase in work absences the day after immunisation, and this is important to consider when planning immunisation of health care workers," he added. Snape, who is also chief investigator on the trial, said it was important to underline the fact that there were no safety concerns, adding it remained unclear whether the immune response will be affected. "We hope to report these data in the coming months. In the meantime, we have adapted the ongoing study to assess whether early and regular use of paracetamol reduces the frequency of these reactions," Snape said. The Com-COV study is backed by £7 million ($9.9 million) of U.K. government funding by the Vaccines Taskforce and run by the National Immunisation Schedule Evaluation Consortium. The study aims to evaluate the feasibility of mixing and matching Covid vaccines to help policymakers understand whether this could be a viable route to increase the flexibility of vaccination campaigns. The trial initially recruited 830 volunteers aged 50 and above. In April, researchers expanded the program to include the Moderna and Novavax Covid-19 vaccines in a new study, known as "Com-COV2." This added a further 1,050 volunteers to the program.
David Kennedy, a former NSA hacker, argued that Russian President Vladimir Putin is connected to the actions of DarkSide, which is allegedly behind the cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline. The assault forced Colonial Pipeline to shut down approximately 5,500 miles of pipeline, leading to a disruption of nearly half of the nation’s East Coast fuel supply.	David Kennedy, a former National Security Agency hacker, argued that Russian President Vladimir Putin is connected to the actions of DarkSide, the group allegedly behind the cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline. The FBI on Monday said DarkSide was behind the ransomware attack that forced Colonial Pipeline to shut down approximately 5,500 miles of pipeline, leading to a disruption of nearly half of the nation's East Coast fuel supply. Darkside has claimed it's not political and only wants to make money without causing problems for society. The Russian embassy didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Kennedy told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith" that he assumes Putin is enjoying the attention while causing issues in the U.S. both from misinformation campaigns and cyberwarfare. "We are seeing so much hostility coming from a cyber warfare campaign perspective, that it's almost difficult to even keep up with it," said Kennedy. Kennedy explained that he is in favor of not paying the attackers when host Shepard Smith asked what the impact would be if the U.S. government required companies not to pay ransomware attackers. "At the end of the day it could have drastic ramifications on businesses, but it would immediately shut off the revenue sources completely, and shut these ransomware groups down," Kennedy said. "I'm a big advocate of that."
Many EU citizens who are still living in the U.K. after Brexit have said they do not feel treated equally to U.K. citizens, according to a survey. A lack of uncertainty about their future status in a post-Brexit U.K. has caused 1 in 10 EU citizens living in Britain to say they are considering leaving the country after the end of June. EU citizens living in the U.K. must apply to remain in the U.K., if they wish to stay, by June 30.	LONDON — Many EU citizens who are still living in the U.K. after Brexit have said they do not feel treated equally to British citizens and feel worried about their rights, a new survey has found. A lack of uncertainty about their future status in a post-Brexit U.K. has caused 1 in 10 EU citizens living in Britain to say they are considering leaving the country after the end of June. This is the deadline for EU citizens to apply to remain lawfully living and working in the U.K. Other findings in the survey of almost 3,000 EU citizens living in the U.K., which was conducted by the Independent Monitoring Authority for the Citizens' Rights Agreements, an independent organization set up to protect the rights of EU citizens living in the U.K., found that trust in public bodies was low. One in 4 respondents in the survey said they did not believe that they are currently treated equally to U.K. citizens and nearly 1 in 2 respondents did not have confidence that they will be treated equally in future, according to the research carried out over a six-week period from February to March this year. Ahead of the Brexit vote in 2016, so-called "leavers" and "remainers" engaged in often vicious debate over the merits and pitfalls of EU membership. Critics of the Leave campaign, and resident EU citizens, felt that there was often a xenophobic undertone to some of the arguments put forward by leavers, whereas leavers felt remainers were often too negative about the U.K. and its prospects as a "sovereign" nation. Were it not for the coronavirus pandemic, the final transition out of the bloc on Jan. 1 2021 and the effects on EU-U.K. trade and politics would likely have been bigger news. Nonetheless, Brexit has left a bitter taste in many people's mouths and still divides the U.K. down national lines — Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain, Wales and England to leave. Almost one in 10 respondents also felt more unwelcome in the U.K. post-Brexit, with one saying there was a "hostile attitude from government towards immigrants" and another saying they felt there was a "hostile environment" with "people becoming more intolerant towards EU citizens." Another summed up recent tense exchanges between the U.K. and EU since the start of the year, when a post-Brexit transition period ended, noting that "the atmosphere between the UK and the EU is hostile, I'm worried." Interestingly, respondents most likely to leave were German, Spanish or French, older males, living in the northeast or southeast of England and those who had lived in the U.K. for five to 10 years. Those most likely to stay were Norwegian, Lithuanian, or Portuguese, younger women, living in Wales or the northeast of England and who had lived in the U.K. for less than a year. In response to the survey, Kevin Foster, the minister for future borders and immigration, said in a statement: "EU citizens who came during free movement are our friends, neighbours and colleagues. We are committed to protecting citizens' rights and have legislated to protect those rights in the UK." "The success of the EU Settlement Scheme, with literally millions of statuses already granted, and the steps we have taken to ensure no-one is left behind, are testament to our determination to ensure EU citizens and their family members get the status they deserve in the UK," he added. Tensions between the EU and U.K. have been high since the shock June 2016 vote in which a narrow majority, 52%, voted to leave the bloc. Years of painstaking (and painful) negotiations ensued to disentangle the U.K. from the now-27 member economic and political union, and to create a new trading relationship. Citizens' rights — both for EU nationals and their families in the U.K. and vice versa — were part of the Withdrawal Agreement struck between the EU and U.K. and essentially these sought to continue any residential and employment rights for each others' citizens that had been held pre-Brexit. EU citizens in the U.K. were told they would have to apply to stay as part of the EU Settlement Scheme and, currently, EU citizens have until June 30 2021 to apply for "settled" or "pre-settled" status (the status granted depends on how long the individual has lived in the U.K.); anyone applying must usually have started living in the U.K. by the end of 2020. Conversely, U.K. citizens in various EU countries have had to apply for new residence permits in their respective adopted countries, with varying deadlines this year. The IMA's survey of EU citizens in the U.K. revealed concerns over future citizens' rights, however, with 30% of respondents not confident their rights will be upheld. One in 25 respondents already believed their rights have been breached. One in 10 respondents said they wouldn't complain about a breach of their rights, believing that complaining would achieve nothing.
Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC TV on Friday that the government would "flex" its inoculation program to direct more doses to the most affected areas, while second doses could be brought forward. The Department of Health and Social Care announced that a new "surge rapid response" team would be deployed to the town of Bolton, where the B1.617.2 variant is spreading rapidly.	LONDON — The U.K. is preparing to deliver surge vaccinations and testing in areas where the new Covid-19 variant first detected in India is spreading. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC TV on Friday that the government would "flex" its inoculation program to direct more doses to the most affected areas, while second doses could be brought forward. In a statement late Thursday, the U.K.'s Department of Health and Social Care announced that a new "surge rapid response" team of 100 nurses, public health advisers and environmental health officers would be deployed to Bolton, a town on the outskirts of Manchester, where the B1.617.2 variant is spreading rapidly. "While there is no firm evidence yet to show this variant has any greater impact on severity of disease or evades the vaccine, the speed of growth is concerning and the government is considering additional action if deemed necessary, including how to best utilize the vaccine roll-out to best protect the most vulnerable in the context of the current epidemiology," the department said in the statement. Surge testing will also be expanded to other areas across the country, along with increased genomic sequencing and enhanced contact tracing. Data on the new variant published Thursday by Public Health England showed that the number of cases across the U.K. had risen from 520 last week to 1,313 this week, with most cases concentrated in northwest England and a few clusters in London. The U.K.'s vaccine rollout has been one of the fastest in the world, with almost 70% of the adult population having received at least one shot. Vaccines are available to anyone over age 38, but the government has said they could be made available to younger people living in multigenerational households. The next phase of England's exit from lockdown is scheduled for Monday, when indoor socializing, hospitality and entertainment will resume. However, Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said in a statement Thursday that the government is "monitoring the situation very carefully and will not hesitate to take further action if necessary." Along with the specialist unit in Bolton, surge testing has already been deployed in 15 areas across England, with more than 800,000 tests distributed. "As set out in the roadmap, we cannot rule out re-imposing economic and social restrictions at a local or regional level if evidence suggests they are necessary to contain or suppress a variant which escapes the vaccine," the DHSC said.
One of the key government strategies to support tourism was to waive priority for certain age groups and the medically vulnerable in its vaccination program, instead focusing on the residents of the many Greek islands. Data shows that as of Wednesday more than 25% of the Greek population have received at least one dose of a vaccine. The British government recently decided to not include Greece on its "green list" of foreign destinations, but the southern nations hopes to be "included soon."	Andreas Patiniotis can't help sounding cheerful as Greece once again welcomes tourists back to the country. "I'm very happy," said the owner of four hotels in one of Greece's most iconic holiday destinations, Santorini. That feeling is spreading across this entire sunny nation, with the economy relying heavily on international visitors. Greece's gross domestic product sank more than 8% in 2020. A large part of that was due to the lack of tourists. This year, the government expects the whole summer season to be double 2020 levels, Alex Patelis, an economic advisor to the Greek prime minister, told CNBC on Thursday. He said this summer "is going to be much easier than before." Patelis said the industry would have now adjusted to Covid-19 safety rules; the vaccination campaign is underway both domestically and abroad; and travelers are keen to seek out some sun. In fact, the main message in the government's latest tourism campaign— "All you want is Greece" — looks to lure mainly northern Europeans that are desperate for some warmer weather after more than a year in lockdowns and strict social-distancing measures. One of the key government strategies to support tourism was to waive priority for certain age groups and the medically vulnerable in its vaccination program, instead focusing on the residents of the many Greek islands. The idea is to ensure that tourist hotspots are protected before the large number of visitors arrive. Athanasia Kokkinogeni, 31, is fully vaccinated. She told CNBC that in her home island, Kythnos, big hotel chains have been remodeling and upgrading ahead of the summer season. "In general, there's optimism," she said, noting that some tourists have already started to arrive. The official date for the tourism industry to reopen is Friday but some establishments have been working over the past days to deal with upcoming bookings. Data from Our World in Data shows that as of Wednesday more than 25% of the Greek population have received at least one dose of a vaccine. This is largely in line with the whole of the European Union, which has around 30% of the adult population vaccinated with at least one dose. The 2021 summer season will also depend on whether governments in some countries, such as the U.K. and Germany, lift their quarantine policies for when holidaymakers return from Greece. The two nations are among the most important for Greek tourism. The British government recently decided to not include Greece on its "green list" of foreign destinations, meaning travelers from England face a period of quarantine when they return from the Mediterranean nation. "All of tourism is very important," Patelis said. "But we are optimistic we will be included soon," he said regarding the U.K. green list. The British government is due to revise its green list every three weeks. Quarantine requirements are an impediment to tourism. However, the European Union is working on a Covid-19 certificate to promote intra-EU travel. The idea is that people that have received a negative coronavirus test, have been vaccinated, or have recently recovered from the disease will not have to quarantine. "We hope this will be the last summer like this," Patiniotis in Santorini told CNBC.
The U.K. will now accelerate second doses of vaccines for the over-50s and the clinically vulnerable due to concerns about the variant from India. Speaking at a news conference Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the variant looked to be more transmissible than other strains, but cautioned that it wasn't clear by how much.	LONDON — U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned Friday that the coronavirus variant first discovered in India has the potential to derail the lockdown easing currently underway in the country. The U.K. will now accelerate second doses of vaccines for the over-50s and the clinically vulnerable due to concerns about the variant from India. Speaking at a news conference Friday, Johnson said the variant looked to be more transmissible than other strains, but cautioned that it wasn't clear by how much. England's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, speaking alongside Johnson , added that there's "confidence" it's "more transmissible" than the variants already circulating in the country. Whitty said: "Earlier this week we said that we thought that it was as transmissible as B.1.1.7 and possibly even more so. There is now confidence ... that this variant is more transmissible than B.1.1.7." The B.1.1.7 variant, known as the U.K. or Kent strain, has an unusually high number of mutations and is associated with a more efficient and rapid transmission of the coronavirus . British scientists first detected this mutation in September of last year and by April it had become the dominant strain in the U.S. Johnson added that there was currently no evidence that the variant would evade the vaccines that are being deployed across the country. "But I have to level with you, this new variant could pose a serious disruption to our progress," Johnson said. "And I must stress that we will do whatever it takes to keep the public safe." Data on the new variant published Thursday by Public Health England showed that the number of cases across the U.K. had risen from 520 last week to 1,313 this week, with most cases concentrated in northwest England and a few clusters in London. The U.K.'s vaccine rollout has been one of the fastest in the world, with almost 70% of the adult population having received at least one shot.

Britain is taking another step toward fully unlocking restrictions on its economy and social contact on Monday. The spread of the Covid variant that first emerged in India is threatening a further lifting of measures in June, however. From Monday, pubs, bars and restaurants can serve customers inside; museums, cinemas and theaters can reopen; and exercise classes and indoor sports can resume.	LONDON – Britain has relaxed restrictions on its economy and social contact further on Monday, but the spread of the Covid variant that first emerged in India is threatening a full lifting of measures. Lockdown measures have been eased in England, Wales and most parts of Scotland on Monday, meaning that pubs, bars and restaurants are now allowed to serve customers inside; museums, cinemas and theaters can reopen; and exercise classes and indoor sports can resume. In addition, up to six people or two households can now socialize indoors and gatherings of up to 30 people are allowed outside, although the rules differ slightly between the constituent nations in the U.K. Northern Ireland is expected to relax its restrictions on indoor hospitality from May 24. International travel can also resume on Monday with people allowed to go on foreign holidays. Countries have been put on a "green," "amber" or "red" list — with varying quarantining rules on return to the U.K. — determined by their infection rate. While the reopening is a sigh of relief for the hospitality, leisure and travel industry, the lifting of restrictions is being tempered by a rise in Covid cases that has been attributed to a variant of the coronavirus that first emerged in India. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a cautious approach to the reopening, warning that the spread of the new variant could threaten further easing on June 21 , when it was hoped all restrictions on social contact would be lifted. Speaking Friday, Johnson said there was currently no evidence that the variant would evade Covid vaccines that are being deployed across the country, but that the new variant "could pose a serious disruption to our progress ... And I must stress that we will do whatever it takes to keep the public safe." He said the variant looked to be more transmissible than other strains, but cautioned that it wasn't clear by how much. England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, speaking alongside Johnson , added that there was "confidence" the strain is "more transmissible" than other variants already circulating in the country. The new variant is also believed to be more transmissible than a variant that first emerged in the U.K. last fall. This became the dominant strain in the country, along with in the U.S. and parts of Europe. On Sunday, the U.K. reported just over 1,900 new cases, bringing the total number of recorded infections in the U.K. to 4,450,777. As of Sunday, 15,918 cases had been reported in the previous seven days, up 8.6% from the May 3-9 period, according to government data . This rise in cases has prompted a change in vaccination strategy from the government, with the over-50s and clinically vulnerable set to receive their second doses eight weeks after the first dose, rather than at 12 weeks as per the previous immunization strategy. On Friday, it was announced that the U.K. would deliver surge vaccinations and testing in areas where the new Covid variant first detected in India is spreading. To date, almost 70% of the British adult population has received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while just over 38% have received two doses. This U.K. on Sunday hit the milestone of having given 20 million people their second dose of a Covid shot. The U.K.'s Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government will make a decision on June 14 whether to go ahead with the final lifting of restrictions a week later. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, Hancock said variants were one "of the biggest risks to this opening." "Because of the speed of transmission of this one, it can really spread like wildfire amongst the unvaccinated groups — hence we need to get as many people vaccinated as possible, particularly among those who are most vulnerable to ending up in hospital." - CNBC's Matt Clinch contributed reporting to this story.
The sector is hoping that the government will lift compulsory quarantines for more destinations. Sunny European destinations, often chosen as holiday spots by British tourists, such as France, Spain, Italy and Greece are currently on the amber list, requiring self-isolation. Stocks in Europe's travel and leisure sector fell more than 1% during early trading hours on Monday.	LONDON — British tourists are now able to fly abroad as Covid restrictions are eased, but only to a limited number of destinations — something that the tourism industry wants to change. People in England and Scotland can fly to a list of 12 countries on the so-called green list from Monday without having to quarantine upon their return. This represents a massive change as vacations abroad have been illegal for months. The advice for people in Wales is only to travel for essential reasons, though taking trips is also no longer prohibited by law. The changes in policy were welcomed by the tourism industry, which is keen to open for business after a challenging time during the pandemic. Nonetheless, the sector is hoping that the government will lift compulsory quarantines for more destinations. "It is a cautious return to international travel. We would have liked to have seen more countries added to the green list," Stewart Wingate, the CEO of Gatwick Airport told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on Monday. The green list represents the group of nations that tourists can visit without compulsory quarantine upon their return. For now, the list includes countries such as Portugal, Israel, Singapore, Iceland and Gibraltar, and it will be reviewed every three weeks. Tourists arriving from one of these destinations will have to provide a passenger locator form, take a Covid test prior to boarding their return flight, and also book and pay for another Covid test for the second day after their arrival. However, visits to nations on the so-called amber list require self-isolation for a period of 10 days, and trips to countries on the red list require a 10-day quarantine in a hotel. Sunny European destinations, often chosen as holiday spots by British tourists, such as France, Spain, Italy and Greece are currently on the amber list. "From an industry perspective what we would like to see is for our government to continuingly review the status of the countries, in particular places like the Spanish islands, the Greek islands and then, in due course over the coming weeks, some of the big destinations that we serve from Gatwick, such as Spain, Italy and Greece and the USA progressively placed on the green list when it is safe to do so," Wingate said on Monday. The CEO of budget airline Ryanair echoed this sentiment. "We look forward to Spain, Italy and Greece being added to the U.K. green list in the next couple of weeks and I think that will accelerate the recovery of booking short-haul holidays from the U.K. to Europe certainly through to July, August and September," Michael O'Leary, the CEO of Ryanair, told CNBC on Monday. The heads of British Airways and Heathrow Airport also urged the U.K. government to allow tourists to visit more European destinations and the U.S. without having to quarantine on their return, Reuters reported. "It's quite important for many of these airline companies that the green list is expanded," Ruhell Amin, equity research analyst at William O'Neil and Co, told CNBC's Street Signs Monday, adding that he expects to see more countries added in the coming weeks. Stocks in Europe's travel and leisure sector fell more than 2% on Monday. Despite the ongoing easing of travel restrictions in the U.K, there's still plenty of uncertainty facing the battered industry as quarantine rules are reviewed and the future of the pandemic remains unclear. Though vaccinations against the coronavirus have picked up pace in the U.K. and European Union, there are concerns about new variants —especially the one first identified in India — and their potential impact. On Sunday, the U.K.'s Health Minister Matt Hancock told the BBC there is "increasing confidence" that Covid vaccines work against the variant identified in India. However, he added that the government cannot yet confirm whether all social restrictions will be lifted on June 21 as initially planned.
Germany's Federal Cartel Office has launched a new investigation into whether Amazon is exploiting its market dominance. Should it find that Amazon has "outstanding, cross-market importance," new digital rules would allow it to prohibit any anti-competitive behavior at an earlier stage. The watchdog has already initiated proceedings against Amazon's price control mechanisms and relationships with third-party traders selling on its site.	Germany's antitrust watchdog said on Tuesday it has launched a new investigation into whether U.S. ecommerce giant Amazon is exploiting its market dominance. "In a first step, we are looking at whether Amazon is of outstanding, cross-market importance for competition," the Federal Cartel Office said in a statement. Should it find that such a marketing position exists, new rules for digital companies would allow it to prohibit any anti-competitive behavior at an earlier stage, the watchdog said. Changes to Germany's antitrust laws for digital corporations, which came into effect earlier this year, give the Cartel Office more power in identifying and prohibiting some companies' dominant positions. The Bonn-based authority has already initiated proceedings against Amazon's price control mechanisms and relationships with third-party traders selling on its site. A spokesman for Amazon said it could not comment on ongoing proceedings.
The coronavirus variant that first emerged in India could become the dominant strain of the virus in the U.K. in a matter of days and could pose unknown dangers, scientists have warned. The U.K. is detecting a rapid spread of the Covid variant "B.1.617" that first emerged in India last October.	LONDON — The coronavirus variant that first emerged in India could become the dominant strain of the virus in the U.K. in a matter of days, scientists have warned. The U.K. is detecting a rapid spread of the Covid variant "B.1.617" that first emerged in India last October and is seen as responsible for a wave of infections that has engulfed the south Asian nation in recent months. B.1.617 has three sub-lineages, each with slightly different mutations, the World Health Organization has said. The B.1.617 variant was dubbed a "variant of concern" by the WHO last week and on May 7, the U.K. dubbed the sub-lineage B.1.617.2 a variant of concern. Since then, the U.K. has seen cases caused by the variant almost double. On Monday, British Health Secretary Matt Hancock told British lawmakers that there were 2,323 cases of the variant known as B.1.617.2 now confirmed in the U.K., up from 1,313 last Thursday. He said 483 of those cases had been detected in coronavirus outbreaks in the northern English towns of Bolton and Blackburn where, he said, it had become the dominant strain with cases doubling there in the last week and "rising in all age groups" — although hospitalizations were stable. There are now 86 local authorities with five or more confirmed cases, Hancock added. The U.K. has introduced "surge vaccinations" in the most badly affected areas in a bid to protect as many people as possible from the virus and variant, which early evidence suggests is more transmissible. Early data shows that the current Covid vaccines in use are still effective against the new variant, one government official said on Monday, although there is now a race to vaccinate younger age groups, and anyone who has previously not accepted the vaccine. There are already concerns in government that the U.K.'s target date for ending all restrictions on social contact, June 21, could have to be reconsidered given the spread of the new variant. Experts are sounding the alarm that it's likely that the variant is already entrenched. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, told the Guardian newspaper on Monday that the India variant could overtake a more transmissible Covid variant (known as B.1.1.7 ) that emerged in the U.K. last fall and which became a dominant strain in the country and other parts of the world. "There is no evidence that the recent rapid rise in cases of the B.1.617.2 variant shows any signs in slowing," he told the newspaper. "This variant will overtake (the Kent variant) and become the dominant variant in the U.K. in the next few days, if it hasn't already done so." Lawrence Young, a virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick, told CNBC on Tuesday that it looked like vaccines were preventing infection with the India variant, but that it would now be hard to stop the spread. "It's very hard to contain these more transmissible variants once they're out there in the world," he told CNBC's "Street Signs Europe." "Obviously what we have in the U.K. at the moment is a race between the virus and vaccinations." That the variant poses potential problems for the U.K., a country with a high Covid vaccination rate (almost 70% of the adult population has had at least one dose of a vaccine and almost 40% have had two doses), does not bode well for other countries further behind in their vaccination programs, particularly in Europe. The WHO has said that the variant from India has been detected across European countries. As of May 11, the B.1.617 variant had been detected in 44 countries in all six WHO regions, the organization said in its last weekly update. Commenting in the British Medical Journal on Monday, one group of experts noted that "there are many things we know and many things we don't know about the B.1.617.2 variant" but that "we know enough to say that this new variant could be extremely serious." "We know that it is spreading fast (roughly doubling each week in the UK and nearly tripling last week from 520 to 1,313 cases), that it is becoming established in a number of areas across the country," wrote Dr. Stephen Reicher from the University of St Andrews and Dr. Susan Michie and Dr. Christina Pagel from University College London who are experts in advisory groups ( SAGE and Independent SAGE ) which provide scientific advice to the government. "Compared to the dominant B.1.1.7 variant, we know that B.1.617.2 is very likely to be more transmissible and that it might be better able to transmit between people who are fully vaccinated," they added. "We don't yet know how much of the faster transmission is down to characteristics of the variant itself as opposed to the characteristics of those who are infected and ... we don't yet know whether and to what extent the new variant undermines the ability of vaccines to protect us against infection, hospitalisation, and death or to stop us transmitting infection to others," they added. They noted that SAGE's "worst case" scenario modeling suggests that if B.1.617.2 were 40-50% more transmissible than the B.1.1.7 variant it could cause an increase in hospitalizations worse than January 2021 "and if it also escapes the vaccines more, the level could be considerably greater." Currently, however, they warned that "we don't know enough to be sure exactly how serious it would be if it became the dominant variant in the U.K."
Consumer prices rose by 1.5% in April, the Office for National Statistics said, following a 0.7% rise in March. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to an increase of 1.4%.	British consumer price inflation more than doubled in April at the start of what the Bank of England hopes will be a temporary surge as the economy recovers from last year's Covid slump. Consumer prices rose by 1.5% in April, the Office for National Statistics said, following a 0.7% rise in March. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to an increase of 1.4%. A jump in regulated electricity and gas bills and clothing and footwear prices helped to push inflation up, along with the cost of petrol, hit by rising global oil prices. Inflation is expected to accelerate in the coming months - mirroring a move underway in the United States as the global economy picks itself up after the COVID-19 pandemic. "With inflation set to pick up further over the coming months and the economy looking poised for decent recovery from the second quarter, attention is increasingly focusing on when the Bank of England could start to tighten monetary policy rather than will the Bank provide further stimulus," Howard Archer, an economist with forecaster EY Item Club said. "However  the Bank of England did not appear to be in a hurry to tighten policy in the minutes of the May MPC meeting." Core inflation, which excludes energy prices and other volatile items, rose by 1.3% in the 12 months to April, the Office for National Statistics said. The BoE says inflation in Britain is heading above its 2% target and will hit 2.5% at the end of 2021 thanks to the rise in global oil prices and the expiry in September of COVID emergency cuts to value-added tax in the hospitality sector, as well as comparisons with the COVID slump of 2020. The BoE thinks inflation will then slip back to 2% in 2022 and 2023. Wednesday's data showed prices charged by manufacturers rose by 3.9% in the year to April, the biggest increase in two-and-a-half years, and the prices they paid for their inputs rose by 9.9%, the most since February 2017. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said on Tuesday there had been little sign so far that these producer cost pressures had fed much into consumer prices in Britain. Last week, data showed U.S. consumer prices jumped to an annual rate of 4.2% in April, the strongest inflation rate since 2008, prompting investors to up their bets on the Federal Reserve raising interest rates sooner than it had signaled.
The euro zone's central bank is particularly concerned about a higher corporate debt burden in countries with larger services sectors, because this could increase pressure on governments and lenders in these nations. This could be a headache in the short term as governments lift their pandemic-related stimulus, such as furlough programs.	LONDON — The 19 nations that share the euro are facing financial risks that are elevated and uneven, the European Central Bank warned Wednesday, and more targeted stimulus could be required as the region recovers from the coronavirus crisis. The pandemic has hit different economic sectors with varying degrees of severity and speed, with tourism and hospitability among the most impacted. In its latest financial stability review, the ECB warned that this uneven shock is concentrating risks in very specific nations and parts of the euro zone economy. "It is a bittersweet message," ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said regarding the latest assessment. "The evolution of the vaccination (program) is very positive, we are catching up and this is, you know, very good news. But simultaneously, well, we continue having some financial stability risks that we need to monitor," de Guindos told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche Wednesday. The euro zone's central bank is particularly concerned about a higher corporate debt burden in countries with larger services sectors, because this could increase pressure on governments and lenders in these nations. This could be a headache in the short term as governments lift their pandemic-related stimulus, such as furlough programs. "As this support is gradually removed, considerably higher insolvency rates than before the pandemic cannot be ruled out, especially in certain euro area countries," the ECB said in a statement. When speaking to CNBC, de Guindos said that "2020 is a little bit of surprise" given that there were fewer corporate insolvencies than in 2019 — before the coronavirus crisis hit the euro area. Nonetheless, he asked for caution as the central bank expects that "in 2021 we will see an important increase in terms of insolvencies." "Perhaps in this case, in this crisis, that is different to previous ones, the existence, and the implementation of support measures by fiscal authorities has increased, has lengthened (this lag)," he said on the time that it usually takes between the decline in growth and the evolution of corporate insolvencies. Another risk on the ECB's radar is the recent surge in U.S. benchmark bond yields. This has already led the central bank to step up its government bond purchases in recent weeks, but the Frankfurt-based institution is still concerned that higher borrowing costs across the Atlantic will affect indebted corporates, households and nations in the euro area. ECB President Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in March: "We are not doing yield curve control." However, the ECB is looking to avoid a premature rise in borrowing costs for euro area governments. This could derail the economic recovery in 2021, after the region's gross domestic product contracted by almost 7% in 2020. "If the increase in yields in unwarranted then, you know, we will act. If the increase in yields is the consequence of the normalization of the economy, then it is something that is going to be part of, let's say, the broader framework," de Guindos said. In addition, the ECB also warned Wednesday that bank profitability in the euro area is still "weak" and lenders might be forced to step up their provisions going forward. "Bank profitability remains weak, while prospects for lending demand are uncertain. Bank asset quality has been preserved so far, but credit risk may materialise with a lag, implying a need for increased loan loss provisions," the ECB said in a statement.
A diplomatic rift has deepened between Spain and Morocco after thousands of undocumented migrants attempted to enter Spanish territory in the northern African country. Spain has been left scrambling to secure its borders after thousands of migrants entered Ceuta, one of two Spanish enclaves situated on the northern coast of Morocco this week.	A diplomatic rift has deepened between Spain and Morocco after thousands of undocumented migrants attempted to enter Spanish territory apparently unimpeded by the Moroccan authorities. Spain has been left scrambling to secure its borders after thousands of migrants entered Ceuta, one of two Spanish enclaves on the northern coast of Morocco this week. Around 8,000 migrants, including families, are reported to have entered Ceuta on Monday and Tuesday, many entering the territory by swimming around border fences in the sea that separate the enclave from Morocco, as well as reports of migrants using inflatables and dinghies. At least one person was reported to have died during the crossing. The influx of migrants prompted Spain to deploy armed forces to secure the beach and to increase a police presence in the enclaves. A smaller number of migrants also tried to enter the Spanish enclave of Melilla further along the coast, according to the Spanish government. Around half of the 8,000 migrants, who were mostly Moroccan according to the BBC, have been returned to Morocco, Spanish authorities said. Nonetheless, the arrivals have provoked a diplomatic spat between Spain and Morocco, particularly following reports and footage that seemed to show the Moroccan authorities allowing migrants to attempt to enter Ceuta without trying to stop them. CNBC has contacted the Moroccan Foreign Ministry for comment but is yet to receive a reply. Ceuta and Melilla have been under Spanish rule since the 17th century, although Morocco has claimed the territories as its own since its independence in 1956. Some believe that the current tension between Spain and Morocco stems from Spain accepting Brahim Ghali, the leader of Western Sahara's Polisario Front, which wants independence from Moroccan administration for Western Sahara, to be admitted to a hospital in Spain for treatment last month, angering Rabat. Morocco reportedly withdrew its ambassador for talks with Madrid after Spain's foreign minister told the envoy of her "disgust" at what had happened, the BBC reported Tuesday. The EU has expressed its support for Spain although the latest incident — one of thousands of attempts by migrants to enter European territory in recent years — has served only to emphasize the porousness of the EU's borders and a lack of unified EU action on migration. It is also another demonstration of the continuing desperation of migrants trying to enter the bloc seeking economic opportunity or refuge from conflict, poverty and human rights abuses. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that the "EU stands in solidarity with Ceuta & Spain" and that the bloc needs "common EU solutions to migration management." "This can be achieved with agreement on the New Pact on Migration. Stronger partnerships based on mutual trust and joint commitments with key partners like Morocco are crucial," she said. EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson also tweeted that "the most important thing now is that Morocco continues to commit to prevent irregular departures" adding that "Spanish borders are European borders. The European Union wants to build a relationship with Morocco based on trust and shared commitments. Migration is a key element in this regard." Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez met with other Spanish government officials on Tuesday at which they discussed what the government described as a "serious crisis for Spain, and also for Europe." There, Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said "what has occurred ... is an attack on our borders, and that cannot be part of good relations with Morocco, but we will continue to maintain them because we are neighboring and close countries." Spain said its priority "is to guarantee traffic control on the border with Morocco" and to provide the cities of Ceuta and Melilla "with all the necessary means to solve the humanitarian crisis caused by the arrival of so many people and proceed with the return of any person who has entered Ceuta and Melilla irregularly, as is foreseen in the agreements signed for years by Spain and Morocco." Sanchez visited Ceuta and Melilla on Tuesday, having vowed to restore "order to the city and its borders." Earlier Tuesday, Sanchez had tweeted that his priority was to "restore normalcy to Ceuta." "Its citizens must know that they have the absolute support of the Government of Spain and the utmost firmness to ensure their safety and defend their integrity as part of the country against any challenge."
Nuremberg-based SUSE had priced the deal towards the lower end of a 29 to 34 euros per share range. CEO Melissa di Donato, the first woman to lead a high-profile initial public offering in Frankfurt, rang the opening bell. "This is the start of an incredible journey," said the American veteran of SAP.	Shares in enterprise software company SUSE held their own in a Frankfurt stock market debut on Wednesday, climbing just above their 30 euro issue price, giving the group a market cap of around 5 billion euros ($6.1 billion). Nuremberg-based SUSE had priced the deal towards the lower end of a 29 to 34 euros per share range with a view to securing a solid aftermarket performance, after volatile markets derailed a number of other European flotations. CEO Melissa di Donato, the first woman to lead a high-profile initial public offering in Frankfurt, rang the opening bell in a video message showing images of cheering team members projected on to a screen behind her. "This is the start of an incredible journey," said the American veteran of SAP, who was hired by private equity investor EQT two years ago and has her sights set on sustaining double-digit growth. SUSE provides open-source software for companies to run applications at cloud datacenters, on-premise servers, mainframe computers and devices at the edges of networks, making it a play on digital transformation. The company, founded three decades ago, runs on the Linux open source standard and counts 60% of the U.S. Fortune 500 companies among its customers. The IPO adds to a busy Frankfurt season, following the $10 billion listing by German used-car trading platform AUTO1 , a $14 billion debut by Vodafone's Vantage Towers and the $5 billion IPO of labs group Synlab. While these deals have proved good bets for investors, other European tech listings, such as Deliveroo and Alphawave have disappointed. Sentiment has also been dampened by Trustly's and Meinauto's cancellations of their IPO plans earlier this month. "All of this has had a major impact on investors' risk appetite and their ability to put money into new tech transactions," said one equity capital markets banker. Companies have to choose between putting off IPO plans and risk a potential repricing of the technology sector as investors' inflation worries return, or move more quickly and take a chance on investors' mood. In the SUSE transaction, Europe's largest software IPO of the year, a total of 37.8 million shares were sold for 1.1 billion euros. The company is issuing new shares to help pay down debt, while owner EQT is also selling down its stake. EQT will remain the company's largest shareholder with a stake of 77.6%. It acquired SUSE in 2018 for $2.5 billion and stands to double its money via the IPO.
An EU source confirmed to NBC News that European ambassadors agreed that fully-vaccinated tourists from the U.S. and other countries would no longer have to quarantine or be tested. NBC News also reported that Americans may eventually be able to apply for a European "Digital Green Certificate."	European Union countries agreed on Wednesday to ease Covid-19 travel restrictions on non-EU visitors ahead of the summer tourist season, two EU sources said. Ambassadors from the 27 EU countries approved a European Commission proposal from May 3 to loosen the criteria to determine "safe" countries and to let in fully vaccinated tourists from elsewhere. They are expected to set a new list this week or early next week. Based on data from the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Britain and a number of other countries would meet the new criteria. The United States would not, although vaccinated Americans would be welcome in Europe. An EU source confirmed to NBC News that European ambassadors agreed that fully-vaccinated tourists from the U.S. and other countries would no longer have to quarantine or be tested. NBC News also reported that Americans may eventually be able to apply for a European "Digital Green Certificate." One EU diplomat said cases of the Indian variant in Britain would need to be taken into account, although individual EU countries are already setting their own policies, therefore there is no set date for restrictions to be lifted. Portugal lifted a four-month travel ban on British tourists on Monday. Under current restrictions, people from only seven countries, including Australia, Israel and Singapore, can enter the EU on holiday, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated. The current main criterion is that there should be no more than 25 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in the previous 14 days. The trend should be stable or decreasing and there should be a sufficient number of tests, which would need to show a minimum percentage of negative tests. Variants of concern can be taken into account. The Commission proposed raising the case rate to 100. The EU ambassadors opted instead for 75. For inoculated people to gain access, they would need to have received an EU-approved vaccine, with those with a World Health Organization emergency listing will be considered. An emergency brake would be used to limit the risk of variants entering the bloc. More details are expected to be released Thursday, although a new expanded list of countries permitted for non-essential travel in Europe is expected to be decided in the next week or two. —CNBC's Vicky McKeever contributed to this article.
African leaders met in Paris over the past two days in a summit convened by France to strike a multibillion-dollar "New Deal" to aid the continent's economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis. The signatories called for an additional $650 billion of IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to be released to close the gap between developed and emerging economies. However, only $33 billion of this has been earmarked for African countries. Le Maire indicated that the French government would be pushing for greater contributions from other major economies at the upcoming G7 (Group of Seven) summit in the U.K. in mid-June.	French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Wednesday warned that peace, security and global stability are in danger if the world's economic superpowers do not contribute to Africa's economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis. African leaders met in Paris over the past two days in a summit convened by France to strike a multibillion-dollar "New Deal" to aid the continent's economic and health revival. The Summit on the Financing of African Economies brought together 21 heads of state from Africa and leaders of continental organizations along with European leaders and the heads of major international finance organizations. In a press conference Tuesday night, French President Emmanuel Macron said the summit had yielded "a New Deal for Africa and by Africa." The signatories called for an additional $650 billion of IMF Special Drawing Rights to be released to close the gap between developed and emerging economies. However, only $33 billion of this has been earmarked for African countries and European leaders have vowed to donate their own shares in order to bring the total for the continent close to $100 billion. The IMF may also contribute some of its gold reserves and in a joint communique after the summit leaders suggested that "flexibility on debt and deficit ceilings" could be used to further alleviate the burden. Le Maire indicated on Wednesday that the French government would be pushing for greater contributions from other major economies at the upcoming G-7 (Group of Seven) summit in the U.K. in mid-June, and would also be reaching out to the G-20. "Developed countries have invested more than 25% of their GDP to fight against the consequences of the crisis and to engage a very strong economic recovery. In Africa, it is less than 2% of their GDP," Le Maire told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick, adding that this trajectory risked a great divergence in the recoveries of economies and health care systems. "This would be a very important danger not only from an economic point of view, but a real danger for security, for peace, for stability, for illegal immigration, so I really urge everybody to be aware of the current situation of the African countries and to be aware of the necessity of putting more money (into) Africa." He suggested that rather than just deploying grants, governments should look to invest in small and medium-sized enterprises, supporting African entrepreneurs who are "at the core of the economic recovery." Despite maintaining comparatively low Covid-19 infection and death rates compared to the rest of the world, sub-Saharan Africa is projected by the IMF to have experienced a 3.3% decline in economic activity in 2020, the region's first recession in 25 years. GDP growth projections for 2021 also lag significantly behind the rest of the world's 6% estimate. The drop in activity is expected to cost the region $115 billion in output losses this year and could push another 40 million people into poverty, effectively wiping out five years of progress against poverty. In Tuesday's press conference, Macron also set a goal to vaccinate 40% of the population of Africa by the end of 2021, calling the current situation both "unfair and inefficient." The summit has urged the World Health Organization, World Trade Organization and the Medicines Patent Pool to remove intellectual property patents blocking the production of certain vaccines. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva cautioned on Tuesday of dire global economic consequences if the vaccine rollout fails in developing countries and the health crisis continues. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday told France24 that he welcomed the group's call for major economies in the northern hemisphere to share their vaccine supplies. "They have a huge surplus and we have no access, and that to me is vaccine apartheid and it can also be characterized as vaccine imperialism," Ramaphosa said. "We will never be able to defeat the pandemic, Covid-19, if we try to defeat it in the northern hemisphere only and not in the south." A landmark proposal to waive intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines was jointly submitted to the World Trade Organization by India and South Africa in October. Several months on, however, it continues to be stonewalled by a small number of governments. These include the U.K., Switzerland, Japan, Norway, Canada, Australia, Brazil, the EU and — until recently — the United States.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday, and said it was "no secret that we have our differences" and that Washington would respond to aggressive acts by Russia, but the world would be safer if the two countries' leaders worked together. Senior U.S. State Department officials said there were no breakthroughs in the meeting, but described it as a "good start" to work on relations between the two countries in "weeks, months and years to come."	Top diplomats from the Biden administration and Russia in their first in-person meeting on Wednesday, stressed that the former Cold War foes have serious differences in how they view world affairs but struck an optimistic tone for the talks, saying the two sides can still find ways to work together. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, a veteran diplomat, and said it was "no secret that we have our differences" and that Washington would respond to aggressive acts by Russia, but the world would be safer if the two countries' leaders worked together. Lavrov, speaking through an interpreter at the opening of the meeting in Reykjavik on the sidelines of an Arctic Council meeting, said Russia and the United States have "serious differences" but have to cooperate "in spheres where our interests collide." Senior U.S. State Department officials said there were no breakthroughs in the meeting, but described it as a "good start" to work on relations between the two countries in "weeks, months and years to come." Blinken said Biden wanted "a predictable, stable relationship with Russia" and said the two countries could work together on tackling the coronavirus pandemic, combating climate change, dealing with Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs, and the war in Afghanistan. "We think that's good for our people, good for the Russian people and indeed good for the world," Blinken said. The pair also discussed cybersecurity and Russia's troop movements on its border with Ukraine, issues that have tested the already fraught ties this year, senior State Department officials told reporters. They repeatedly insisted that the meeting was "table setting" for future talks. Wednesday's meeting, the first high-level, in-person discussion between the Biden administration and a Russian counterpart, lasted one hour and 45 minutes, longer than the expected one hour. Lavrov told Russian state media the talks were "constructive" and that Russia was ready to discuss all issues between the two countries "on the basis of mutual respect." The two diplomats would prepare proposals for a possible meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Lavrov said. State Department officials referred questions about a presidential meeting to the White House, but said there was acknowledgment that "strategic stability" would be discussed. Blinken pushed for Russia to release U.S. citizens Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed and raised the health of detained Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, U.S. officials said. Half an hour into Wednesday's meeting, the U.S. imposed sanctions on some ships and entities involved in the construction of the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would take Russian gas from the Arctic to Germany, a deal Biden has opposed. The administration decided, however, to waive sanctions on the company behind the pipeline and its chief executive. Before the announcement, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov had said the waiving of those sanctions would help normalize ties between Moscow and Washington. A State Department official said the pipeline came up in the talks, but was not the subject of extended discussion.
Ireland's High Court last week dismissed a challenge from Facebook over a regulatory inquiry that could lead to a ban on its EU-U.S. data transfers. The High Court will hold a short hearing Thursday where it is expected to lift temporary freeze on the probe. A block on Facebook's transatlantic data flows would likely force the company to process EU data within the bloc, and that has serious implications for other U.S. tech giants.	LONDON — Facebook faces a potential ban on the transfer of Europeans' data to the United States. That would be a "massive blow" to the social networking giant, according to experts, and has serious implications for other large American tech firms. Last week, Ireland's High Court dismissed a challenge from Facebook over a regulatory inquiry that could lead to a ban on the flow of its user information from the European Union to the U.S. It comes after a landmark ruling from the EU's top court invalidated the use of Privacy Shield, a framework for the transatlantic sharing of data. The decision was a victory for Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy activist who has taken Facebook to task over how it handles data on European citizens. Schrems argued that, in light of revelations from American whistleblower Edward Snowden , U.S. law did not offer sufficient protection against surveillance by public authorities. In September, Ireland's Data Protection Commission sent Facebook a preliminary order to stop using an alternative tool, known as standard contractual clauses, to send user information from the EU to the U.S. Facebook said this measure would threaten its European operations and secured a temporary freeze on the order. Now, the way Facebook transfers data from the EU to America is once again under threat. On Thursday, the Irish High Court will hold a short hearing where it is expected to lift a stay on the DPC's order and its inquiry into Facebook's EU-U.S. data flows. "Like other companies, we have followed European rules and rely on Standard Contractual Clauses, and appropriate data safeguards, to provide a global service and connect people, businesses and charities," a Facebook spokesperson told CNBC. "We look forward to defending our compliance to the DPC, as their preliminary decision could be damaging not only to Facebook, but also to users and other businesses." In the event that Facebook is forced to stop transferring Europeans' information to the U.S., experts believe the company will likely be required to process EU data within the bloc. And the fallout from the European Court of Justice's original ruling could affect many more U.S. tech firms. "In reality Facebook would have to 'split' its service into a European and a U.S. service," Schrems told CNBC by email. "The absolutely 'necessary' transfers (e.g. when a U.S. user is sending a message to an EU user) can still happen between these two systems. The rest needs to stay in Europe (or in another safe country). Obviously Facebook will do everything to avoid that." The move "could be a massive blow for the revenue model of Facebook," which has more than 400 million monthly active users in Europe, according to Cillian Kieran, founder and CEO of data privacy software start-up Ethyca. "The recent ruling, and the potential suspension of Facebook's data flows, suggest serious challenges for other U.S. companies to conduct international business, especially those with fewer resources than Facebook to navigate legal procedures," Kieran told CNBC. Many U.S. internet giants — including Apple and Google — have established their European headquarters in Ireland. Ireland's DPC is the lead privacy regulator for these companies. "The news raises the stakes for U.S. businesses to meet global standards for data protection, not only to earn users' trust in the marketplace but also — on a more fundamental level — to be able to bring their product to important markets in the first place," said Kieran. The European Data Protection Board — an independent European body tasked with ensuring consistent application of the EU's GDPR privacy rules — is expected to soon issue its final guidance on how businesses must comply with the ECJ's decision when it comes to international data transfers, cloud use and remote processing.
The British government announced that a new state-owned body will be established in a bid to simplify the country's rail network. The network will be rebranded Great British Railways and will oversee trains, tracks, timetables and stations, including managing rail infrastructure, setting fares and selling tickets. SFM UK Management LLP, the British unit of Soros Fund Management, has a short position against Trainline, whose shares tanked following the government announcement.	A British digital travel booking company shorted by George Soros' U.K. investment arm saw its shares plummet Thursday as the U.K. government announced a historic overhaul of its railways. Shares of Trainline had fallen by 23% at the close of trade in London, having earlier fallen by as much as 32%. Investors fled the stock after the government announced that a new state-owned body will be established in a bid to simplify the country's rail network. SFM UK Management LLP, the British unit of Soros Fund Management, has a short position against the stock, which it steadily increased over the month of March to 0.7%, according to the Financial Conduct Authority's public disclosures. Short positions are established when a trader borrows a security and sells it with the intention of repurchasing it at a lower price at some point in the future, therefore profiting from the stock's depreciation in value. "When there are limited barriers to entry for a business there are always risks as rail ticket seller Trainline is discovering to its cost today, lending credence to financier George Soros' decision to short the stock through his U.K. investment arm," said Russ Mould, investment director at British digital stockbroker AJ Bell. "When your potential competitor is the state the threat can be almost existential, and the sweeping changes to the UK railway network which have been announced contain an important detail which is potentially devastating to Trainline's business model." The network will be rebranded Great British Railways and will oversee trains, tracks, timetables and stations, including managing rail infrastructure, setting fares and selling tickets. While trains will still be operated by private companies, the GBR will issue new "passenger service contracts" to these companies. The changes are due to take effect in 2023, but have already come under criticism from Britain's main rail union, RMT, which called the plans a "missed opportunity" to make a "clean break" from the failures that have blighted the country's rail network in recent decades. "The Government talks about ending a generation of fragmentation but then leaves the same private companies in place under this arrangement to extract management fees that could be invested into building a truly integrated national rail network," RMT said in a statement. "The taxpayer carries all the risk while the train companies carry out bags of cash." Mould added the GBR's move into ticket sales could mean customers buy tickets from the centralized body, and if the "labyrinthine" ticket-pricing system becomes easier to navigate, Trainline will have a less significant role in helping passengers find the best available prices. Trainline had been steadily growing revenues until the coronavirus pandemic and had enjoyed a dominant position in the domestic online travel booking market, with 70% of all digital fares currently sold by the company. However, revenues fell 74% in the year to Feb. 28 and led to an operating loss of £100 million ($141.3 million). Trainline is also now among the most shorted stocks on the London market, with six fund managers holding short positions amid doubts that domestic public transport demand will return to pre-pandemic levels. The company continued investing in innovations such as personalized predictive travel and location technology, but Mould doubted that this would be enough to retain market share. "The company now faces a two-year deadline to somehow preserve its relevance under the new setup. It won't be an easy task," he added. In the prospectus distributed prior to its IPO in 2019, Trainline warned that policy or regulatory changes affecting the rail network could adversely affect its results and future projects. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, suggested that sales volumes and revenue could be seriously impacted if National Rail Enquiries, the U.K.'s primary rail information source, starts issuing tickets. "Trainline's current commission rates are guaranteed until April 2024 under an agreement with the Rail Delivery Group, but after that how the company will slot into the new rail world is far from clear, without further detail about how the new system will operate.″
The resolution to freeze ratification passed with 599 votes in favor, 30 votes against and 58 abstentions. The EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment aimed to put EU companies on an equal footing in China and cement Beijing's status as a trusted trading partner.	The European Parliament halted on Thursday ratification of a new investment pact with China until Beijing lifts sanctions on EU politicians, deepening a dispute in Sino-European relations and denying EU companies greater access to China. The resolution to freeze ratification passed with 599 votes in favor, 30 votes against and 58 abstentions. The EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, agreed by negotiators in December after seven years of talks, aimed to put EU companies on an equal footing in China and cement Beijing's status as a trusted trading partner. But Beijing imposed sanctions in March on 10 EU politicians, as well as think-tanks and diplomatic bodies, in response to Western sanctions against Chinese officials accused of the mass detentions of Muslim Uyghurs in northwestern China. China's sanctions include five members of the EU assembly and its human rights sub-committee. "With its sanctions, China has miscalculated. They should learn from their mistakes and rethink. Because of China's sanctions, the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment has been put into the freezer," said Reinhard Butikofer, a German EU lawmaker who Beijing targeted with its sanctions. EU lawmakers say the Chinese sanctions are not based on international law, while the bloc's measures, like those of Britain and the United States, tackle abuses of human rights upheld in United Nations treaties. Beijing denies any wrongdoing. The parliament "demands that China lift the sanctions before dealing with (the investment accord)", it said in its resolution, which is not legally binding but is now the assembly's official position. "EU-China relations may not continue business as usual," it said. In response to the resolution, China's mission to the EU said the investment agreement was "mutually beneficial" and not a "favour" from one side to the other. China's sanctions were a legitimate response to EU actions, it said. "China has all along sincerely promoted bilateral cooperation and hopes the EU will meet us half way," the mission said in a statement posted on its website on Friday. The impasse is a setback for both China and the EU. Ratification of the pact would allow greater protection of European investment and intellectual property rights in China. China was hoping for improved international standing as a fair and respectful trading partner, European diplomats say. Activists and U.N. rights experts say at least 1 million Muslims are detained in camps in Xinjiang. The activists and some Western politicians accuse China of using torture, forced labor and sterilizations. China denies rights abuses in Xinjiang and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.
EU countries officially agreed on Thursday to welcome foreign travelers who have received one of the coronavirus vaccines approved by European regulators. So far, these include the vaccines from Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. Vaccinated people will be allowed to enter the bloc, if they've received the last recommended dose at least 14 days before their arrival in the EU.	Delicious pasta in Florence, a walk down the Champs-Élysées in Paris, or a beautiful sunset on one of the Greek islands — tourism in Europe is looking to get back to normal this summer. EU countries officially agreed on Thursday to welcome foreign travelers who have received one of the coronavirus vaccines approved by European regulators. So far, these include the vaccines from Pfizer and BioNTech , Moderna , AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson . Vaccinated people will be allowed to enter the bloc, if they've received the last recommended dose at least 14 days before their arrival in the EU. Ultimately, each member state will decide when to reopen its borders and to whom. Therefore, each government from the 27 nations will decide whether to completely lift quarantine measures and/or testing for international visitors. Children who are excluded from vaccination can travel to the bloc with their family, if they've had a negative test no more than 72 hours before arrival. Though it remains to be seen how each EU nation will welcome foreign travelers, the agreement at the EU level is a welcome step by the battered tourism industry. "We know that consumers want to be able to travel this summer and so we welcome that European countries could enable those who are vaccinated could travel without the need for testing," a spokesperson for the airline easyJet told CNBC via email. "It is of course important that this is implemented in a simple way to ensure it is easy for passengers," the same spokesperson said. The EU decision could be particularly important for British tourists, who are now outside of the EU and represent one of the most important markets for tourism-reliant EU nations. In addition, people in the United States, Israel and other highly vaccinated parts of the world are also likely to benefit from the EU's stance. Up until now, the EU was only assessing a country's coronavirus infection rate to decide whether visitors should be allowed in. But the bloc is also now relaxing this rule and more citizens from more countries will get the greenlight. But, Brussels is also conscious that the health situation might change due to new variants of the virus. As a result, EU countries have also agreed on a new "emergency brake," meaning that if the epidemiological situation in one nation deteriorates, then they will be able to impose travel restrictions from that country quickly. Travel and leisure stocks in Europe closed higher by 1.5% on Thursday. Stephen Furlong, senior analyst at wealth management firm Davy, told CNBC that the EU's decision was broadly expected by market players, hence the muted stock reaction. "It is still not clear whether the U.S. is opening to Europe," he said, regarding one of the main uncertainties for international travel this summer, while predicting that he doesn't expect "consumers will travel in scale."
The Green Party is riding high in German voter polls and looks set to become a central political force in Berlin. Business leaders like former Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser are watching the run-up to Germany's general election in September with interest.	Germany's Green Party is riding high in the voter polls and looks set to become a central political force in the country, with federal elections due in September. And while the political pundits and policymakers are busy with the election campaign, business leaders are keenly watching with interest at the developments in Berlin. One such figurehead is Joe Kaeser, the former chief executive of engineering powerhouse Siemens , who told CNBC that the rise of the Greens is an "interesting thing to watch." "For the first time they've got a chancellor candidate, a female. This time they have the aspiration to rule the country, not just (on an) environmental (level), but on a 'I'm going to run one of the most efficient economies in the world' (level). That's a statement," he told CNBC's Annette Weisbach this week. Voter polls show that the Greens, led by their candidate Annalena Baerbock, are in position to be a part of the next coalition government. Some recent voter polls even put the party ahead of Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling conservative alliance of the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union, although the latest polls have shown that the so-called "Green bounce" has waned somewhat. Politico's poll of polls currently puts the Greens and the CDU-CSU as level-pegging, both with 25% of the vote with The Social Democratic Party behind with 15% of the vote. Summing up most analysts' perspective on the Greens, Carsten Nickel and Luis Cornago, deputy director research and senior associate, respectively, at Teneo Intelligence, remarked in a note Wednesday that "the party is entering the election campaign from a position of "unprecedented strength." The party is "rapidly emerging as the new centrist player in German party politics and will most likely be part of the next federal government," they added. Kaeser, who departed Siemens in February and is now chair of spinoff Siemens Energy , said "it remains to be seen" what impact the Greens can have on Germany's economy and industry, but said he was "very curious and (to see) how it works. "They say there's a chance for a new beginning here, which we should not miss," he told CNBC. He said that whatever the next government looked like, "they need to be really, really quick" in setting up a policy framework that German industry can follow. "If the industry gets a very clear framework, and are being pushed into something which the society believes is relevant, they will be able to execute (it). There may be some fallout and consolidation, because you know, not everybody can win. But that's the nature of survival, because the ones who survive will emerge stronger," he said. There's undoubtedly a sense of trepidation in German industry and politics as both prepare for the departure of Merkel after 16 years as leader. Kaeser said he had been a big admirer of Merkel and that she had been "clearly a positive for Germany all over the world." "She's leaving big shoes to fill, definitely. So we'll see." Kaeser said, adding that he was not so impressed by the CDU-CSU's approach to the succession. "It's been very hard for the Christian Democrats to develop somebody in the succession planning, (and that) probably be my biggest criticism — that the succession planning in the Christian Democratic environment has not exactly been well developed, let me put it this way," he said. Merkel announced in 2018 that she would not stand for a fifth term in office and Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer was appointed as head of the CDU. She was seen as Merkel's likely successor, although she stood down in early 2020 after several missteps and having failed to unite the party. Until April this year, neither party had been able to agree who it would front as its candidate for chancellor in September's election, although Armin Laschet, the leader of the CDU and state-premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, was eventually nominated as the candidate .
Peter Toogood, chief investment officer at financial services firm Embark Group, believes European stocks may well keep pace with U.S. stocks in the coming months, but that's not to say he shares Wall Street's optimism for the region. Analysts at Morgan Stanley say Europe is well-placed to outperform all major regions this year for the first time in more than two decades. Separately, analysts at Goldman Sachs have identified "inexpensive" stocks in Europe for the rest of the year, while JPMorgan has named "cheap" stocks to buy in the region if the market dips.	LONDON — Not everyone is bullish on Europe for the remainder of the year. Peter Toogood, chief investment officer at financial services firm Embark Group, believes European stocks may well keep pace with U.S. stocks in the coming months, but that's not to say he shares Wall Street's optimism for the region. Analysts at Morgan Stanley say Europe is well-placed to outperform all major regions this year for the first time in more than two decades. The investment bank believes U.S. markets are likely to be "choppier" in the months ahead, citing rising inflation, growing pressure on profit margins and a possible slowing of quantitative easing. Meanwhile, there is a "compelling" case for Europe to be the best-performing region due to attractive valuations, stronger earnings-per-share growth and the launch of the EU's massive post-Covid recovery fund. Separately, analysts at Goldman Sachs have identified " inexpensive " stocks in Europe for the rest of the year, while JPMorgan has named " cheap " stocks to buy in the region if the market dips. When asked whether he agreed with the view that European equities could soon decouple from the U.S., Toogood told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Friday: "No I don't … I'm not buying it this time." "I'll happily acknowledge that we'll keep up … There's going to be a Covid bounce, notionally, they are getting their act together, there is the recovery coming but it is going to be very late. We are going to be into the autumn and winter soon where I'm sorry (but) Covid is not going to go away," he continued. "So, no, I'm not buying it. I think they have come too late to the party in terms of the vaccines; very sadly, and therefore the recovery is delayed," Toogood said. To date, around 33% of EU citizens have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, according to statistics compiled by Our World in Data. By contrast, nearly 48% of the U.S. population has received at least one vaccine dose. The International Monetary Fund said last month that Europe's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic was on track to return to pre-crisis levels in 2022. The forecast was conditional on the region's Covid-19 vaccine campaign, and as uncertainty persists over how the health crisis will evolve. "I think the second problem remains: What are you buying when you buy Europe?" Toogood said, noting possible exceptions in the region among some "very strong" consumer brands. "The banking sector? No, not really. I don't see interest rates going anywhere in Europe for a very long time and they've been withdrawing globally, if anything. Most of the Europeans, in terms of banks and activities, are heading inward." "There's a massive discount gap but that's because a lot of the stocks in the U.S. are priced more highly because they simply grow better. There are no FAANGs in Europe I'm afraid," he continued, referring to the acronym for Facebook , Amazon , Apple , Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet . "So, there is trouble for the indices in Europe and the U.K. … That's the reality. We haven't got the disruptors and we don't have the exciting industries. It's Asia and America where that action sits," Toogood said. — CNBC's Lucy Handley contributed to this report.
William and Harry's comments came shortly after an inquiry found that BBC journalist Martin Bashir had used duplicitous means to win an interview with Diana and that the broadcaster had since sought to cover it up. Diana died in a car crash in Paris at age of 36 in 1997. Two years earlier, during a sensational BBC "Panorama" interview, more than 20 million people watched on as Diana shared details of her marriage to Prince Charles, the heir to the throne.	LONDON — Britain's Prince William has sharply criticized the BBC for failing his late mother, Princess Diana, saying the deceitful way a journalist at the U.K. broadcaster secured an exclusive interview with her in 1995 fueled her feelings of isolation and worsened his parents' relationship. In a separate statement issued at the same time on Thursday, Prince Harry blamed a toxic media culture for his mother's death. William and Harry's comments came shortly after an inquiry found that BBC journalist Martin Bashir had used duplicitous means to win an interview with Diana and that the broadcaster had since sought to cover it up. Diana died in a car crash in Paris at age 36 in 1997. Two years earlier, during a sensational BBC "Panorama" interview, more than 20 million people watched on as Diana shared details of her marriage to Prince Charles, the heir to the throne. "It is my view that the deceitful way the interview was obtained substantially influenced what my mother said. The interview was a major contribution to making my parents' relationship worse and has since hurt countless others," William, the Duke of Cambridge, said in a statement late Thursday. "It brings indescribable sadness to know that the BBC's failures contributed significantly to her fear, paranoia and isolation that I remember from those final years with her," he added. Late last year, the BBC launched an investigation following allegations from Charles Spencer, Diana's brother, that he had been tricked into introducing her to Bashir. The findings of the inquiry, led by former senior judge John Dyson, found that Bashir had commissioned fake bank statements by a graphic designer who worked for the BBC. They purported to show bank transactions suggesting Diana was being bugged by the security services and that two senior aides were being paid to provide stories about her. The BBC said the investigation found that Bashir "showed the fake documents to Earl Spencer, to gain his trust so he would introduce Bashir to Diana." It said Bashir repeatedly lied to his bosses about how the interview was obtained, while senior figures at the broadcaster were said to have failed to scrutinize his version of events thoroughly. Bashir has apologized for the fake statements. However, he also said he stood by the evidence he gave 25 years ago and more recently, claiming that the bank statements had "no bearing whatsoever" on Diana's choice to take part in the interview. The BBC said it had written to Buckingham Palace to apologize. "The ripple effect of a culture of exploitation and unethical practices ultimately took her life," Harry said in a separate statement. "To those who have taken some form of accountability, thank you for owning it. That is the first step towards justice and truth," he continued. "Yet what deeply concerns me is that practices like these — and even worse — are still widespread today. Then, and now, it's bigger than one outlet, one network, or one publication." Harry and wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, stepped back from their roles as working royals early last year , citing hostility from the British tabloid press that they said Buckingham Palace had failed to defend them from. "She was failed not just by a rogue reporter, but by leaders at the BBC who looked the other way rather than asking the tough questions," William said of his mother. "These failings, identified by investigative journalists, not only let my mother down, and my family down; they let the public down too," he added.
The IMF is calling for at least 40% of the global population to be vaccinated by the end of the year. Only about 9.5% of the global population has received at least one dose, according to Our World in Data. The Washington-based institution said in April that the global economy is expected to grow by 6% this year.	LONDON — The International Monetary Fund wants $50 billion to be spent on ensuring a faster rollout of coronavirus vaccines, saying it could ultimately generate returns of $9 trillion for the global economy. The IMF on Friday called for at least 40% of the global population to be vaccinated by the end of the year, and at least 60% by June 2022. Only about 9.5% of the global population has received at least one dose, according to Our World in Data. "No country can return to normalcy until all countries can defeat the pandemic," the IMF said in a new report entitled "A proposal to end the Covid-19 pandemic." To achieve this, the Fund said there needs to be a global effort to invest another $50 billion to bolster the global vaccination program. This additional amount would be used to increase the COVAX vaccine coverage to 30% of the globe, procuring additional tests, and expanding vaccine production capacity. COVAX is an international partnership to ensure an equitable distribution of doses. The IMF suggested that at least $35 billion could come from public, private and multilateral donors, with the remainder coming from governments, potentially supported by multilateral agencies. It said there is already at least $15 billion available from Covid-19 financing facilities created by development banks, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. "The IMF can also play its role to help countries meet their financing needs — supporting countries' own efforts to create fiscal space and potentially acting as a third-resort line of finance," the report said. The Washington-based institution said in April that the global economy is expected to grow by 6% this year and by 4.4% in 2022. However, since the pandemic emerged, the IMF has warned of an uneven impact from the health crisis and the subsequent economic crisis. "The social and economic costs of the pandemic continue to rise and already diverging recoveries between rich and poor nations looks to worsen," the IMF said in its proposal. The plan comes as the leaders of the 20 largest global economies gather virtually on Friday to discuss how to cooperate in the fight against the pandemic. "We believe addressing the pandemic remains our foremost priority," Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, the host of the meeting, said ahead of the global summit. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said the meeting aims to gather commitments and investments that will guide the next decade of global health cooperation. One of the most recent topics of debate in the fight against the virus has been over patent waivers . The United States surprised its European counterparts when earlier this month it expressed support for a lifting of intellectual property rights for Covid vaccines. Supporters of the idea say it is critical to ramp up vaccination rates in low-income nations. However, the EU disagrees, arguing that boosting exports of the shots is the most efficient solution in the short term. The EU and the U.S. have taken different approaches to supporting other nations. The U.S. introduced legislation that only allows it to export a significant amount of Covid-19 vaccines once it is satisfied with the levels of inoculation within its own borders. On the other hand, the EU claims it is the biggest exporter of Covid shots in the world, exporting half of what it has produced.
The U.S. Treasury Department released its plans on Thursday, saying that international negotiations should be ambitious — meaning that ultimately the figure could be higher than 15%. The corporate tax rate in the U.S. is currently 21%, but President Joe Biden has plans to raise it to 28% and wants higher rates in the rest of the world.	LONDON — Germany on Friday warmly welcomed a United States proposal that calls for corporations around the world to pay at least a 15% tax on their earnings. The U.S. Treasury Department released its plans on Thursday, saying that international negotiations should be ambitious — meaning that ultimately the figure could be higher than 15%. The corporate tax rate in the U.S. is currently 21%, but President Joe Biden has plans to raise it to 28% and wants higher rates in the rest of the world. "This is really a big progress," German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said Friday morning regarding the U.S. announcement. "I am now, at this morning, very happy." "We are happy that it looks very much like we will have a solution in the summer this year. And the new administration in the United States makes a difference because they said it is feasible to do it," Scholz told reporters in Lisbon, Portugal. "This is the best chance for having a global tax reform which (will fight) against the race to the bottom," he added. The issue can be contentious within the European Union, where various member states charge different corporate tax rates and can attract big-name firms by doing so. Ireland's tax rate, for example, is 12.5%, while France's can be as high as 31%. Speaking in April, Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said smaller nations should be allowed to have lower tax rates given that they don't have the same capacity for scale as the larger economies do, the U.K.'s Guardian newspaper reported.
The Biden administration is facing backlash for a decision to waive sanctions on a Russian company overseeing the construction of the controversial Russia-to-Germany gas pipeline, known as Nord Stream 2. "I believe they're essentially deferring to Chancellor [Angela] Merkel to figure out some kind of a strategy that she thinks may work, and maybe get Russia to behave better over Ukraine and other places... But if that's the strategy, I'd like to hear it explained and defended, not just sort of swept under the rug," said Michael O'Hanlon.	Michael O'Hanlon, a Brookings Institution senior fellow, said he thinks the Biden administration's decision to waive sanctions on a Russian company overseeing the construction of a controversial Russia-to-Germany gas pipeline was about improving relations with Germany. "I believe they're essentially deferring to Chancellor [Angela] Merkel to figure out some kind of a strategy that she thinks may work, and maybe get Russia to behave better over Ukraine and other places... But if that's the strategy, I'd like to hear it explained and defended, not just sort of swept under the rug," said O'Hanlon. The Russia-to-Germany gas pipeline, known as Nord Stream 2, would bring natural gas from Russia to Germany and run under the Baltic Sea. Critics from both sides of the political aisle expressed concern that Russia could use the pipeline to gain leverage over European nations. Republican Senator Rob Portman slammed the decision and has said it was "contrary to our national interests, and at an especially volatile period, helps Russia while hurting Ukraine and our European Union allies." New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen said in a statement that "completion of this pipeline poses a threat to U.S. security interests and the stability of our partners in the region." The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. O'Hanlon told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith " that he agreed with the critics. "It's confusing why you would give Russia more leeway, more leverage, and also the ability to bypass Ukraine in shipping gas into Europe," said O'Hanlon. "It doesn't smack me to be a good decision."
Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko ordered a Ryanair flight carrying a young opposition blogger to land in Belarus on Sunday and detained him on arrival. Detained activist Roman Protasevich was put on a wanted list after last year's mass street protests following the Belarus election. Lithuania has called for a NATO response.	Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko ordered a Ryanair flight headed for Lithuania and carrying a young opposition blogger to land in Belarus on Sunday and detained him on arrival, prompting Lithuania to call for a NATO response. Law enforcers detained activist Roman Protasevich, 26, who had been put on a wanted list after last year's mass street protests following an election in which Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory. The aircraft, flying from Athens to Vilnius, had almost reached Lithuania when it changed direction and was escorted to the Belarusian capital of Minsk amid reports that it had explosives on board, according to an online flight tracker and BelTA. Lukashenko personally ordered the warplane to escort the Boeing to Minsk, state news agency BelTA reported. No explosives were found, it said. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda condemned Belarus' actions, demanding Protasevich be released and calling on for an international response. "I call on NATO and EU allies to immediately react to the threat posed to international civil aviation by the Belarus regime. The international community must take immediate steps that this does not repeat," Nauseda said. Lithuanian presidential advisor Asta Skaisgiryte said the operation to force-land the plane carrying around 170 people from 12 countries seemed to be pre-planned. She said Belarus intelligence services knew who was onboard the plane, which was forced to land with the help of MIG-29 fighter jet. Protasevich had lived in Vilnius since November, she said. Lithuania and traditional Russian ally Belarus are neighbors and former members of the Soviet Union. Lithuania is now a member of the European Union, Belarus is not. A Lithuanian airport authority spokeswoman told Reuters the plane, scheduled to land in Vilnius earlier on Sunday, was now expected to land at 1500 GMT or later. Ryanair had no immediate comment. The Belarus department for organized crime control also reported that Protasevich had been detained but then deleted the statement from its Telegram channel. In power since 1994, Lukashenko launched a violent crackdown on the 2020 street protests. Around 35,000 people have been detained since August, human rights groups say. Dozens have received jail terms. Authorities say that more than 1,000 criminal cases have been launched. Protasevich is one of the founders of the opposition news service NEXTA, a Telegram channel that has become one of the main sources of news about demonstrations in Belarus. It is hostile to Lukashenko and helps to coordinate protests. Belarusian opposition politician Svetlana Tikhanouskaya, Lukashenko's main rival at the last election, said Belarus authorities "placed at risk safety of passengers on board and all of the civil aviation for the sake of punishment of the man who was an editor of Belarus's largest independent Telegram channel".
Belarus forced a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania to land in Minsk and arrested a passenger, dissident journalist Roman Protasevich. "We demand his immediate release," U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. "This shocking act perpetrated by the Lukashenko regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, including U.S. citizens."	Belarus provoked outrage in the West after one of its warplanes forced a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania to land in Minsk and arrested a passenger, dissident journalist Roman Protasevich. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it a "shocking act." More than 170 people were reportedly aboard. The plane, on a flight from Athens to the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, was in Belarus airspace when it was intercepted and forced to land in its capital Minsk. Protasevich, a 26-year-old dissident journalist and passenger on the flight, was then arrested. Belarus, an ally of Russia, said Monday its air traffic controllers could not "force" the Ryanair flight to land, and instead gave the plane's crew "recommendations," Reuters reported citing Russian news agency RIA Novosti. Belarusian state-owned news agency BelTA reported that authorities scrambled a MiG-29 fighter jet to divert the flight as it neared the Lithuanian border following orders from strongman President Alexander Lukashenko. Ryanair confirmed that the crew on flight FR4978 had been notified by Belarusian air traffic control of a potential security threat on board. The plane landed and safety checks were carried out but "nothing untoward was found." CNBC contacted the Belarusian Foreign Ministry for comment Monday but is yet to receive a reply. However, the ministry's press secretary told Russian news agency RIA that the West was jumping to conclusions. "The haste of openly belligerent statements on the part of a number of countries and European structures is striking. The situation is being directly and clearly aggravated" the spokesman said, claiming it was being "deliberately politicized." Protasevich is a co-founder and former editor of the Nexta channel on the social media platform Telegram, a key destination for the political opposition in Belarus. His arrest has provoked outrage in Europe and the U.S. who called for his immediate release. Nexta attracted the ire of Lukashenko last year after it bypassed a news blackout and reported on anti-Lukashenko protests following a general election widely believed to have been rigged in the president's favor. The Belarusian president has denied the election was fixed. Nexta was designated an extremist organization by Belarus last year. In November, Belarus asked Poland to extradite Protasevich, who has been living in exile since 2019, to Belarus for what it called his "continuing criminal activity" and involvement with Nexta and Nexta Live. Franak Viacorka is senior advisor to Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Belarus' opposition leader who is also currently in exile, this time in Lithuania. He told CNBC on Monday that Protasevich was one of many disrupters challenging Lukashenko's regime. "He was always fighting for justice and he was the symbol of the young person who disagrees with the government and who wants change," he said. "He's not the only one. Right now there are 3,000 criminal cases open against young people, journalists, teachers, doctors ... but Roman was one of the most vocal, and I think journalists are the main target for the regime right now." Viacorka said he expected that Protasevich would now be in the custody of the KGB ( Ryanair's CEO said earlier Monday that he believed there were Belarusian KGB operatives on board the flight ) and that his safety was potentially at risk. "I know for sure that the KGB will not let him go easily," he added. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen likened the incident to a "hijacking," while Belarus' actions were dubbed "an act of state terrorism" by Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who said it must not go unpunished. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis went further, stating that he believed "Belarusian airspace is completely unsafe for any commercial flight, and it should be deemed this not only by EU but by international community." EU officials are likely to discuss on Monday whether to impose more sanctions on Belarus. It has already seen several high-level officials, including the president, targeted with sanctions for what the EU called "the ongoing violent repression and intimidation of peaceful demonstrators, opposition members and journalists, among others." The U.S. strongly condemned what it called the "forced diversion" of the flight and arrest of journalist Protasevich. "We demand his immediate release," Secretary of State Blinken said in a statement. "This shocking act perpetrated by the Lukashenko regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, including U.S. citizens. Initial reports suggesting the involvement of the Belarusian security services and the use of Belarusian military aircraft to escort the plane are deeply concerning and require full investigation." He added that "given indications the forced landing was based on false pretenses, we support the earliest possible meeting of the council of the International Civil Aviation Organization to review these events." The top U.S. official concluded that "independent media are an essential pillar supporting the rule of law and a vital component of a democratic society. The United States once again condemns the Lukashenka regime's ongoing harassment and arbitrary detention of journalists." The U.K.'s Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the incident an "outlandish action by Lukashenko (that) will have serious implications," while German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted that "this cannot go without clear consequences on the part of the EU." On Sunday, the European Commissioner for Transport Adina Valean tweeted that "this kind of situation will have consequences" and that we "will not accept that passengers on EU airlines are put in harm's way." Repercussions for Belarus might be easier in theory than in practicer. Daragh McDowell, head of Europe and principal Russia analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, told CNBC that Belarus's actions put the EU "in a bind." "Belarus ... is not really a state that can survive on its own and Russia has already signaled it will back up the regime in place and will continue to fund the Belarusian state ... so it's really difficult to see what the EU can do and what area of leverage it really has over Minsk at this point," he said. "Sanctions can be intensified, but that won't really accomplish much and the bigger issue will remain that with Russia in Belarus' corner there really isn't much you can do to impose real costs for actions like this." For its part, Russia, which exerts a strong influence over Belarus, has stepped in to defend Belarus and slammed the West's reaction, describing it as "shocking."
A new study has found that two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca-University of Oxford vaccine give effective protection against the Covid variant first discovered in India. The data underscored the need for two doses, as both vaccines were significantly less effective after only one shot. The study also found that two doses of the vaccine were similarly as effective at protecting against the variant that first emerged in the U.K.	A new study has found that two doses of either the Pfizer - BioNTech or AstraZeneca -University of Oxford vaccine give effective protection against the Covid variant first discovered in India, however it underscored the need for two doses, as both vaccines were significantly less effective after only one shot. The study, led by Public Health England , also found that two doses of one of those vaccines were similarly as effective at protecting against the variant that first emerged in the U.K. and has since become a dominant strain in the West. Dr. Jenny Harries, CEO of the U.K. Health Security Agency, told the BBC that the study provided the "first real-world evidence of vaccine effectiveness" against the variant first identified in India. Conducted between April and May, the research found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 88% effective against symptomatic disease from the B.1.617.2 Covid variant — a subtype of a variant that emerged in India last fall which has since spread to Europe — two weeks after the second dose. The vaccine was 93% effective two weeks after the second dose against the B.1.1.7 variant. which was first discovered in the U.K. last fall. Meanwhile, two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were found to be 60% effective against symptomatic disease from the B.1.617.2 variant from India, compared with 66% effective against the strain from the U.K. "Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease from the B.1.617.2 variant is similar after 2 doses compared to the B.1.1.7 (Kent) variant dominant in the U.K., and we expect to see even higher levels of effectiveness against hospitalisation and death," the study authors wrote. The results were published Saturday as a preprint and the study has not yet been peer-reviewed. PHE said the difference in effectiveness between the vaccines after two doses "may be explained by the fact that rollout of second doses of AstraZeneca was later than for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and other data on antibody profiles show it takes longer to reach maximum effectiveness with the AstraZeneca vaccine." However, both vaccines were only  33% effective against symptomatic disease from B.1.617.2 three weeks after the first dose. In the same time frame, they were found to be 50% effective against the B.1.1.7 variant. The variant first discovered in India has been blamed for causing a dramatic third wave of infections in the country, overwhelming hospitals and causing thousands of deaths this spring. There were concerns that Covid vaccines could be rendered less effective by the variant so the latest data should help allay those worries. The India variant has been detected in numerous other countries now, according to the World Health Organization, which dubbed it a "variant of concern" in early May. The PHE study analyzed data from 1,054 people, of all age groups and several ethnicities, confirmed as having the B.1.617.2 variant through genomic sequencing. The data was collected from April 5 and hence covers the period since the B.1.617.2 variant (one of three variant subtypes found in India) emerged in parts of the U.K. "As with other variants, even higher levels of effectiveness are expected against hospitalisation and death. There are currently insufficient cases and follow-up periods to estimate vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes from the B.1.617.2 variant. PHE will continue to evaluate this over the coming weeks," the study's authors added. Responding to the study, the U.K.'s health secretary, Matt Hancock, described the findings as "groundbreaking – and proves just how valuable our Covid-19 vaccination programme is in protecting the people we love." The U.K. has given more than 22 million people two doses of a Covid vaccine, while 72% of the population (or almost 40 million people) have had one shot, government data shows . Hancock said the latest data emphasized "how important the second dose is to secure the strongest possible protection" against Covid-19 and its variants. Separate PHE analysis indicated that the country's Covid-19 vaccination program has so far prevented 13,000 deaths and around 39,100 hospitalizations in older people in England, up to May 9.
Belarus ordered its military to scramble a fighter jet to force a Lithuania-bound Ryanair plane to change course and land in its capital city, citing a potential security threat on board. State media in Belarus said President Alexander Lukashenko had personally given the order. After the flight landed in Minsk, dissident journalist Roman Protasevich was arrested. The European Union has called for his immediate release and said it would discuss the appropriate action to take.	LONDON — Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary asserted Monday that the decision by Belarusian authorities to divert a plane flying over its territory and to arrest a dissident journalist on board constituted "state-sponsored piracy." He said he believed Belarusian KGB operatives were traveling on the scheduled flight from Athens for Vilnius, Lithuania. "It appears the intent of the authorities was to remove a journalist and his traveling companion ... we believe there were some KGB agents offloaded at the airport as well," O'Leary told Irish Newstalk radio. He said he believed the incident was likely the first of its kind for a European airline. "This was a case of state-sponsored hijacking ... state-sponsored piracy," he said. Belarus on Sunday ordered its military to scramble a fighter jet to force the Ryanair plane to change course and land in its capital city, citing a potential security threat on board. State media in Belarus said President Alexander Lukashenko had personally given the order. CNBC contacted the Belarusian foreign ministry for comment Monday but is yet to receive a reply. Police arrested political activist and blogger Roman Protasevich, 26, when passengers disembarked. His girlfriend Sofya Sapega, a 23-year-old Russian citizen studying at the European Humanities University in Lithuania, was also detained, according to reports. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said via Twitter on Sunday that the "outrageous and illegal behaviour of the regime in Belarus will have consequences," adding those responsible "must be sanctioned." The European Union has also called for the immediate release of Protasevich and said it would discuss the appropriate action to take. The U.S. echoed calls for the immediate release of Protasevich and said it condemned the "forced diversion" of the flight. "Given indications the forced landing was based on false pretenses, we support the earliest possible meeting of the council of the International Civil Aviation Organization to review these events," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. In a statement Monday , the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations and the European Cockpit Association also shared concerns that the forced landing amounted to an "act of unlawful interference, bearing all the hallmarks of state-sponsored hijacking." Both bodies called for an independent enquiry into the incident. "Any military intervention against a civilian aircraft constitutes a willful hazard to the safety of passengers and crew," they added.
In what EU leaders have called a brazen "hijacking" of the Ryanair jetliner flying from Greece to Lithuania on Sunday, they also demanded the immediate release of the journalist, Raman Pratasevich. A brief video clip of Pratasevich was shown on Belarusian state television Monday night, a day after he was removed from the Ryanair flight.	The European Union agreed Monday to impose sanctions against Belarus, including banning its airlines from using the airspace and airports of the 27-nation bloc, amid fury over the forced diversion of a passenger jet to arrest an opposition journalist. In what EU leaders have called a brazen "hijacking" of the Ryanair jetliner flying from Greece to Lithuania on Sunday, they also demanded the immediate release of the journalist, Raman Pratasevich, a key foe of authoritarian Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. A brief video clip of Pratasevich, who ran a popular messaging app that played a key role in helping organize massive protests against Lukashenko, was shown on Belarusian state television Monday night, a day after he was removed from the Ryanair flight. Sitting at a table with his hands folded in front of him and speaking rapidly, Pratasevich said he was in satisfactory health and said his treatment in custody was "maximally correct and according to law." He added that he was giving evidence to investigators about organizing mass disturbances. In their unusually swift action in Brussels, the EU leaders also urged all EU-based carriers to avoid flying over Belarus, decided to impose sanctions on officials linked to Sunday's flight diversion, and urged the International Civil Aviation Organization to start an investigation into what they see as an unprecedented move and what some said amounted to state terrorism or piracy. The leaders called on their council "to adopt the necessary measures to ban overflight of EU airspace by Belarusian airlines and prevent access to EU airports of flights operated by such airlines." In addition to Pratasevich, they also urged authorities in Minsk to release his Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, who was taken off the plane with him. The text was endorsed quickly by leaders determined to oppose a "strong reaction" to the incident because of the "serious endangering of aviation safety and passengers on board by Belarussian authorities," according to an EU official with direct knowledge of the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly about the private talks. Ryanair said Belarusian flight controllers told the crew there was a bomb threat against the plane as it was crossing through Belarus airspace on Sunday and ordered it to land. A Belarusian MiG-29 fighter jet was scrambled to escort the plane in a brazen show of force by Lukashenko, who has ruled the country with an iron fist for over a quarter-century. Belarus authorities then arrested the 26-year-old activist, journalist and prominent Lukashenko critic . Pratasevich and his Russian girlfriend were taken off the plane shortly after it landed, and authorities haven't said where they're being held. Ryanair Flight FR4978, which began in Athens, Greece, was eventually allowed to continue on to Vilnius, Lithuania. U.S. President Joe Biden was briefed on the incident and National Security adviser Jake Sullivan raised the issue in his call with the secretary of the Russian Security Council, said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. She added the administration condemned what she called the "shocking act" of diverting a flight to detain a journalist. "It constitutes a brazen affront to international peace and security by the regime. We demand an immediate international, transparent and credible investigation of this incident," she said, adding the U.S. was in touch with NATO, the EU, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, among others about next steps. EU leaders were particularly forceful in their condemnation of the arrest and the move against the plane, which was flying between two of the bloc's member nations and was being operated by an airline based in Ireland, also a member. The bloc summoned Belarus' ambassador "to condemn the inadmissible step of the Belarusian authorities" and said in a statement the arrest was yet again "another blatant attempt to silence all opposition voices in the country." Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said "the scandalous incident in Belarus shows signs of state terrorism and it's unbelievable," while EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it amounted to a "hijacking." EU leaders have tried to bring Belarus closer to the bloc — to encourage democratic reforms and reduce the influence of Russia — but have failed so far. Ahead of their summit, some EU leaders threatened more sanctions — from scrapping landing rights in the bloc for Belarus' national carrier Belavia to exclusions from sports events. Even before the EU acted, Latvia's airBaltic said it would avoid Belarusian airspace, and Lithuania's government said it would instruct all flights to and from the Baltic country to avoid Belarus as well starting Tuesday. British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he instructed the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority "to request airlines avoid Belarusian airspace in order to keep passengers safe." He added he was suspending the permit allowing Belavia to operate in the U.K. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ordered officials to move to cut the air link with Belarus and ban Ukrainian flights via the neighbor's airspace. The U.S. and the EU have imposed sanctions on top Belarusian officials amid months of protests, which were triggered by Lukashenko's reelection to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition rejected as rigged. More than 34,000 people have been arrested in Belarus since then, and thousands beaten. The Belarusian Foreign Ministry bristled at what it described as "belligerent" EU statements, insisting Minsk acted "in full conformity with international rules." It ordered all Latvian diplomats out of the country after the Belarusian flag was replaced Monday with the white-and-red one used by the opposition at the world ice hockey championship in Riga, Latvia. The event was moved from Minsk amid the international outcry over the crackdown. Lufthansa said a flight from Minsk to Frankfurt with 51 people aboard was delayed Monday following a "security warning." It was allowed to depart after the plane, passengers and cargo were searched. On Sunday, flight tracker sites indicated the Ryanair flight was about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Lithuanian border when it was diverted. There were conflicting reports on what exactly happened. Belarusian transport ministry official Artem Sikorsky said the Minsk airport had received an email about the bomb threat from the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Lukashenko's press service said he had ordered a fighter jet to accompany the plane after being told of the bomb threat. Deputy air force commander Andrei Gurtsevich told Belarusian state TV that the Ryanair crew decided to land in Minsk, adding that the fighter jet was sent "to ensure a safe landing." But Ryanair said in a statement that Belarusian air traffic control instructed the plane to divert to the capital. The plane was searched, and no bomb was found. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary described the move as "a case of state-sponsored hijacking … state-sponsored piracy." In an apparent reference to the Belarusian security agency that still goes under its Soviet-era name KGB, O'Leary he told the Irish radio station Newstalk that he believes "some KGB agents offloaded from the aircraft" in Minsk. Of the 126 people aboard the flight initially, only 121 made it to Vilnius, according to Rolandas Kiskis, chief of criminal police bureau in the Lithuanian capital where an investigation investigation has begun. Passengers described Pratasevich's shock when he realized the plane was going to Minsk. "I saw this Belarusian guy with girlfriend sitting right behind us. He freaked out when the pilot said the plane is diverted to Minsk. He said there's death penalty awaiting him there," passenger Marius Rutkauskas said after the plane finally arrived in Vilnius. "We sat for an hour after the landing. Then they started releasing passengers and took those two. We did not see them again." Pratasevich was a co-founder of the Telegram messaging app's Nexta channel, which played a prominent role in helping organize the anti-Lukashenko protests. Nearly 2 million Belarusians in the nation of 9.3 million people have followed the channel, which has been the main conduit for organizing demonstrations and offered advice on how to dodge police cordons. It also has run photos, video and other materials documenting the brutal police crackdown on the protests. Belarus authorities have labeled the channel "extremist" and charged Pratasevich in absentia of inciting mass riots and fanning social hatred. He could face 15 years in prison if convicted. In November, the Belarusian KGB put Pratasevich on a list of people suspected of involvement in terrorism, an ominous sign that he could face even graver charges. Terrorism is punishable by death in Belarus, the only country in Europe that maintains capital punishment. Amid the international outrage, Moscow quickly offered a helping hand to its ally. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the episode needs to be investigated — but that it couldn't be rushed. Moscow and Minsk have close political, economic and military ties, and Lukashenko has relied on Russian support amid Western sanctions. In a previous diversion of a passenger flight, a United Airlines flight in 2004 from London to Washington carrying the singer Yusuf Islam, better known as Cat Stevens, was sent to Bangor, Maine, where FBI agents met the plane and sent him back to England. U.S. officials said he was denied access to the United States on national security grounds. He later was allowed into the U.S.
Biden made the statement as the European Union imposed sanctions against Belarus, including banning its airlines from using the airspace and airports in the 27-nation bloc in reaction to Sunday's forced diversion of the Lithuania-bound Ryanair flight. The flight had originated from Greece, but was forced to land in Minsk.	President Joe Biden on Monday said the forced diversion by Belarus of a commercial passenger jet so it could arrest an opposition journalist was "a direct affront to international norms" and condemned the action as an "outrageous incident." Biden made the statement — and joined calls for an international investigation — as the European Union imposed sanctions against Belarus, including banning its airlines from using the airspace and airports in the 27-nation bloc in reaction to Sunday's forced diversion of the Lithuania-bound Ryanair flight. The flight had originated from Greece, but was forced to land in Minsk. Biden in his statement also expressed outrage over a video statement from Raman Pratasevich, who ran a popular messaging app that played a key role in helping organize massive protests against Belarus authoritarian leader President Alexander Lukashenko, that aired on Belarusian state television Monday night. In the video clip, Pratasevich, 26, said his treatment in custody was "maximally correct and according to law." He added that he was giving evidence to investigators about organizing mass disturbances. "This outrageous incident and the video Mr. Pratasevich appears to have made under duress are shameful assaults on both political dissent and the freedom of the press," Biden said in a statement. "The United States joins countries around the world in calling for his release, as well as for the release of the hundreds of political prisoners who are being unjustly detained by the Lukashenka regime." Separately, the White House said that national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Monday spoke with Belarus opposition leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Sullivan told the opposition leader that the U.S. "in coordination with the EU and other allies and partners, will hold the Lukashenka regime to account." Two U.S. senators urged the Biden administration to prohibit U.S. airlines from entering Belarus airspace because of the incident. "We must protect innocent passengers from despotic regimes and stand in solidarity with dissidents who are being targeted," Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in a joint statement. The U.S. and the EU had already imposed sanctions Belarusian officials amid months of protests, which were triggered by Lukashenko's reelection to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition rejected as rigged. More than 34,000 people have been arrested in Belarus since then, and thousands beaten. "I applaud the courage and determination of Belarusians fighting for basic rights, including journalists like Raman Pratasevich and opposition leaders like Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya and her husband, Syarhey Tsikhanouski," Biden said in a statement. "The United States will continue to stand with the people of Belarus in their struggle." Pratasevich was a co-founder of the Telegram messaging app's Nexta channel, which played a prominent role in helping organize the anti-Lukashenko protests.
On the EU's table is the possibility of stepping up sanctions against Belarus. Gitanas Nauseda, president of Lithuania, suggested that the airspace over Belarus should be recognized as unsafe and Belarussian aircraft should not be accepted at European airports. Alexander Stubb, former prime minister of Finland, told CNBC on Monday that "the EU should use all instruments in its toolbox, starting with sanctions across the board."	LONDON — Outraged European leaders are gathering in Brussels on Monday to discuss how to punish Belarusian authorities, after the forced landing of a Ryanair flight and subsequent arrest of a journalist on board. A fighter jet escorted the Ryanair flight, which was in Belarusian airspace, to land in the capital of Minsk. The authorities cited a security threat but then proceeded to detain dissident journalist Roman Protasevich. Ryanair has since called it "an act of aviation piracy" and Belarus has been widely condemned by the West. The plane had been traveling from Greece to Lithuania — two EU members — on Sunday. The EU summit on Monday was meant to be a meeting about climate action, but instead it is now expected to be dominated by the incident in Belarus . "This is yet another blatant attempt by the Belarusian authorities to silence all opposition voices," the 27 EU member states said in a statement on Monday morning. Nigel Gould-Davies, a former U.K. ambassador to Belarus, told CNBC's " Street Signs " on Monday that it was "absolutely imperative that the EU, and I hope with American support as well, will take a much stronger and concerted stance now." On the EU's table is the possibility of stepping up sanctions against Belarus. The EU put forward sanctions against the regime and, in particular, against President Alexander Lukashenko in 2020 for the violent repression and intimidation of peaceful demonstrators, opposition members and journalists. This came in the aftermath of a presidential election that took place in August, which the EU did not recognize as free and fair. Gitanas Nauseda, president of Lithuania, suggested that the airspace over Belarus should be recognized as unsafe and Belarussian aircraft should not be accepted at European airports. Alexander Stubb, former prime minister of Finland, told CNBC on Monday that "there is no hope for cooperation before regime change. The EU should use all instruments in its toolbox, starting with sanctions across the board." The incident comes at a time when the EU has struggled to reach a consensus over key foreign policy matters. Last week, for example, the 27 nations in the bloc failed to agree on a common statement on the recent conflict between Israelis and Palestinians after Hungary declined to sign it off. Earlier this month, EU ministers also did not agree on a common statement on China, also after Hungary blocked a consensus. "The Ryanair hijack is the ultimate test case for the credibility of the EU foreign policy on both the world and EU stage," Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law at H.E.C. business school, told CNBC. "Either the EU will succeed in unanimously speak(ing) and act(ing) against Lukashenko's (Belarus), and Russia — should its involvement be confirmed  — or this accident could mark the end of the Union's much-sought strategic autonomy," he added. Franak Viacorka is senior advisor to Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Belarus' opposition leader who is also currently in exile, this time in Lithuania. He told CNBC's Dan Murphy on Monday that Protasevich was one of many disrupters challenging Lukashenko's regime. He said it was crucial that Belarus was now on the agenda at the EU summit, and said he expected ministers and leaders in the region to support Belarusian citizens. He added that Belarus could prove to be a success story if Washington and Brussels acted together. "Right now there are 3,000 criminal cases open against young people, journalists, teachers, doctors ... but Roman was one of the most vocal, and I think journalists are the main target for the regime right now," he said.
Exiled activist Roman Protasevich played an "extremely important role" in mobilizing people to join street protests in the past year, said Franak Viacorka, who advises opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. "This is why he became the enemy, the personal enemy for (President) Lukashenko," he said. Viacorka also said the political crisis in Belarus has turned into a humanitarian one.	Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko sees exiled activist Roman Protasevich — who was arrested after a Ryanair flight he was on was diverted — as a "personal enemy," according to a senior advisor to a Belarusian opposition leader. That's because Protasevich, a prominent critic of the president, played an "extremely important role" in mobilizing people to join street protests in the past year, said Franak Viacorka, who advises opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. "He was writing stories, he was commenting on news and he was explaining (to) people basic things — why they should get involved in politics, why everyone must participate," Viacorka told CNBC's Dan Murphy on Monday. "This is why he became the enemy, the personal enemy for (President) Lukashenko," he said. Belarusians took to the streets after a presidential election in August 2020 that the opposition and some election workers say was rigged. Lukashenko, who has run the eastern European country of roughly 9.4 million people for over a quarter of a century, has denied these accusations. Viacorka said Protasevich, 26, was always fighting for justice and was a symbol of the young people who want change in the country. Belarus on Sunday ordered its military to scramble a fighter jet to force a Lithuania-bound Ryanair plane to change course and land in its capital city, citing a potential security threat on board. State media in Belarus said Lukashenko had personally given the order. Police arrested Protasevich when passengers disembarked in Minsk. His girlfriend Sofya Sapega, a 23-year-old Russian citizen studying at the European Humanities University in Lithuania, was also detained, according to reports. People are usually sent for interrogations that could last for days after being detained, said Viacorka. "This is the harshest time," he said, adding that authorities will try to get as much information as possible from detainees. "I'm really worried about (Protasevich's) safety, about his health and even about his life," he said. Viacorka said he believed Protasevich could be in the custody of the KGB, referring to the Soviet-era name of the Belarusian state security agency. "In Belarus KGB, this is the place where people disappear. This is the place where people lose health, and sometimes people are dying," Viacorka said. "I hope he's healthy and good, but I know for sure that the KGB will not let him go easily," he said. On Tuesday, Viacorka posted a video of Protasevich on Twitter. He wrote that the clip — in which Protasevich says he has been treated correctly and lawfully — is "terrifying" and that the journalist had "obviously" been beaten. The Belarusian foreign ministry was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. He also told CNBC that Lukashenko's actions, if confirmed, were not the sign of power but "the sign of desperation, and the sign also that Lukashenko will not stay in power for long." World leaders should take a tougher position over the incident, Viacorka said. "We see how Belarus is transforming from an authoritarian state to North Korea, a North Korea in the center of Europe," he said. "This is not only about domestic policy, it's about European security right now … the EU, along with the U.S., Canada and the U.K. must take a strong stance and must impose strong sanctions," he added. Russia has defended Belarus and analysts say Moscow could benefit if Minsk's ties with the West are strained further. Viacorka said Belarus could be a "success story" if Washington and Brussels work together and called on European leaders to help the country. "This is not only (a) political crisis anymore, this is a humanitarian crisis right now," he said. Politicians around the world have expressed outrage at the incident and pressed for the immediate release of Protasevich and Sapega. The European Union has decided to ban Belarusian airlines from European skies and told EU airlines not to fly over Belarus. The leaders of the 27 member states also promised to enact further targeted economic sanctions . Belarus' opposition is working with the U.K. and EU to develop a plan of economic support, said Viacorka. He said it shows Belarusians that Lukashenko is not the only guarantor of stability and prosperity. Local communities have also emerged and can help the country build "authentic, genuine democracy" in the future, he added. Those who oppose Lukashenko's regime need to stay optimistic and united on the "very long path to freedom and democracy," he said. "I was, many times, attacked during different rallies and protests but I must say that we were never so close to victory as we are right now," said Viacorka. He said he is "very hopeful" that political prisoners and those in exile will be able to return home in the next year. "We will be thinking, together, how to build Belarus — free, European, democratic, open to the world, with people who are happy to live in this country," he said.
Comcast's NBCUniversal News Group on Thursday announced NBCU Academy, a journalism training and development program that's set to partner with 17 academic institutions across the U.S. The NBCU Academy launch comes about half a year after Comcast committed to spending $100 million over three years to help combat racism and injustice. The company said NBCU Academy will invest $6.5 million toward the initiative, which includes $3.5 million in scholarships over the next two years.	Comcast 's NBCUniversal News Group on Thursday announced NBCU Academy, a journalism training and development program that's set to partner with 17 academic institutions across the U.S. The NBCU Academy launch comes about half a year after Comcast committed to spending $100 million over three years to help combat racism and injustice, following the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. "NBCU Academy is part of that pledge and focuses on providing tools, resources, and platforms for young, underrepresented voices," the company said in a statement. The group of schools include historically Black colleges and universities, known as HBCUs, Hispanic-serving institutions, and colleges with significant Latino, Asian, Black, Indigenous and tribal populations. The company said NBCU Academy will invest $6.5 million toward the initiative, which includes $3.5 million in scholarships over the next two years. The program will provide on-campus training and online programming, including guest lectures with NBCU News Group journalists, executives and management. Many large tech companies announced hefty donations to support racial equality over the summer. On Wednesday, Apple announced its latest set of major donations as part of its $100 million initiative to help promote racial equality for people of color.

Early-stage venture capital firm Harlem Capital will receive a $10 million investment over two decades as part of Apple's diversity push. Apple announced Wednesday how it will allocate $100 million to address racial equity and justice. According to a 2020 Crunchbase Diversity Spotlight report, Black and Latino founders represented only 2.6% of the total $87.3 billion in funding toward the end of 2020.	Early-stage venture capital firm Harlem Capital will receive a $10 million investment as part of Apple 's diversity push. Apple announced the investment on Wednesday as part of its plan to allocate $100 million to address racial equity and justice. CEO Tim Cook originally announced the Racial Equity and Justice Initiative in June as one of a number of corporate reactions to civil unrest following the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The funding will be coming over the next two decades and help Harlem Capital with its goal of investing in 1,000 diverse-led businesses in 20 years. "We're always trying to get capital in the hands of people in proportion to the population," said Jarrid Tingle, managing partner at Harlem Capital, in an interview on CNBC's " Squawk Alley " on Thursday. The firm currently holds 21 investments across 11 cities and nine industries. Forty-three percent of the companies are exclusively women-led, while 47% are led by Black or Latino CEOs. Companies in the firm's portfolio include Black media company Blavity and government affairs platform GovPredict . The firm previously received a portion of PayPal 's $50 million investment to address the venture capital funding gap facing Black and Latino entrepreneurs. According to a 2020 Crunchbase Diversity Spotlight report , Black and Latino founders represented only 2.6% of the total $87.3 billion in funding toward the end of 2020, despite the dollar amounts increasing every year. Tingle, however, remained optimistic that the tide is turning. "The time will come," Tingle said. "The challenge is they weren't really getting these opportunities until about 2013 or 2014, so they never had the opportunity to get to the point where they would go public." While some experts point to a pipeline problem, Tingle said that is not something he faced in identifying diverse-led companies. When Harlem Capital launched an investment search, they found 200 women-, Black- and Latino-led companies that had independently raised over $1 million. "Our bet at Harlem Capital is that backing these entrepreneurs will help them build companies, generate wealth, hire diverse people and then reinvest when they're successful, and that is happening," said Tingle. "But we also believe you can't be what you don't see."
Twitter's efforts to foster diversity and balance will come as much from its employment agenda as its user policy, the company's APAC head has said. Maya Hari told CNBC the company has "work to do" but insisted its ambitious diversity goals would create a more balanced platform. By 2025, the company aims for 50% of its global workforce to be women, while Asia Pacific should constitute a "diverse slate" of employees, said Hari.	As social media comes under increasing scrutiny, Twitter's efforts to cultivate a diverse and balanced platform will come as much from its employment agenda as its user policy, the company's Asia-Pacific head told CNBC. Maya Hari, Twitter's vice president for APAC, said the company has "work to do" amid ongoing concerns that social media is damaging public discourse. But she insisted that its ambitious diversity goals would help bring a greater balance of voices to the site. Hari's comments were made prior to last week's storming of the U.S. Capitol and Twitter's subsequent move to permanently suspend President Donald Trump's account over fears of "further incitement of violence." "The health of the conversation, the ability to have every voice represented, has been a big priority and a strategy for us for years," Hari said. "If we want to build a platform as Twitter that has a place and a voice for every person on this planet, we have to be able to represent those kinds of voices inside the company as well," she continued. Currently, women account for 42% of Twitter's global workforce — a figure the company hopes to raise to 50% by 2025 . By then, it aims for at least 25% of its U.S. operations to be from underrepresented minorities. Hari said the Asia-Pacific business does not have specific targets for minority representation due to the varied ethnic make up of each country. Instead, managers have been asked to build a "diverse slate" of employees. "As we go outside of the U.S., that reality changes market to market depending on the constitution locally," said Hari. Growth markets, such as those in Southeast Asia, offer a particular opportunity to implement those hiring policies. That, in turn, will enable employees to "bring more voices from Southeast Asia and represent them" through  community projects. Twitter is currently working with youth gamers in Japan, women in India and indigenous communities in Australia, for instance, to bring better representation to the social media site, Hari noted. "Impact for us is not only to think about how do we get the right representation inside the company, but also to get the right representation externally on the platform," she said. The events of last week and evidence that social platforms were used to orchestrate the attack have once again sparked the debate around regulation of the industry and its role in encouraging extremism. On Wednesday, following the Capitol riots, Twitter suspended more than 70,000 accounts associated content related to the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory. In comments prior to the unrest, Hari said Twitter was using a combination of "product, people and policy" to ensure that it was amplifying positive conversations and catching toxic ones that need to be looked at. Currently, 50% of questionable content is caught proactively through a combination of "technology and human intervention," while the rest were reported by users, the company said. The company has also introduced a series of new capabilities, such as prompts to check whether users have read an article before sharing it. "We have expressed our desire to be the best tech company, as an aspiration for us to be the most diverse, the most inclusive tech company we can be," said Hari.
Microsoft-owned GitHub said on Sunday that the company's head of human resources resigned after an investigation into the company's dismissal of a Jewish employee. On Jan. 8, GitHub fired one of its employees after he expressed concern for colleagues as a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol, calling some of the rioters "Nazis." After an investigation, GitHub's COO said there were "significant errors of judgment and procedure" with the company's decision to split with the employee.	Microsoft -owned GitHub, the code sharing site for software developers, said on Sunday that the company's head of human resources resigned after an investigation into the company's dismissal of a Jewish employee found "significant errors of judgment and procedure." On Jan. 8, GitHub fired one of its employees after he expressed concern for colleagues in Washington D.C. as a violent mob supporting President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol. The terminated employee told TechCrunch in an interview published on Friday that he made a comment in Slack saying "stay safe homies, Nazis are about." Fellow GitHub employees raised concerns about why the company fired the employee immediately afterward, according to a statement from Chief Operating Officer Erica Brescia. After an independent investigation, the company found "significant errors of judgment and procedure" concerning the dismissal of the employee, Brescia said. "Our head of HR has taken personal accountability and resigned from GitHub yesterday morning, Saturday, January 16th," Brescia said in a blog post on Sunday . The company did not disclose the name of the human resources chief who resigned, however, Carrie Olesen has served in the top spot. A spokesperson for the company wasn't immediately available for comment. Brescia said GitHub "immediately reversed" its decision to split with the employee "and are in communication with his representative." "To the employee we wish to say publicly: we sincerely apologize," Brescia said. The company's Chief Executive Officer Nat Friedman acknowledged in the post that the violent mob did include "Nazis and white supremacists." On Wednesday, FBI spokeswoman Christina Pullen said in a statement that a man who was photographed at the riot wearing a "Camp Auschwitz" shirt was arrested, NBC News reported. A rioter photographed carrying a Confederate battle flag in the halls of the Capitol was also arrested the following day. "Employees are free to express concerns about Nazis, antisemitism, white supremacy or any other form of discrimination or harassment in internal discussions," Friedman said in a statement.
President Joe Biden ordered his Department of Justice not to renew its contracts with private prisons, one of multiple new planks of Biden's broad-focused racial justice agenda. It was one of four new executive actions after Biden laid out his racial equity plan. The actions are aimed at combating discriminatory housing practices, reforming the prison system, respecting sovereignty of Tribal governments and fighting xenophobia against Asian Americans, especially in light of the Covid pandemic.	President Joe Biden ordered his Department of Justice on Tuesday to phase out its contracts with private prisons, one of multiple new planks of Biden's broad-focused racial justice agenda. Biden signed four additional executive actions after laying out his racial equity plan at the White House. The actions are aimed at combating discriminatory housing practices, reforming the prison system, respecting sovereignty of Tribal governments and fighting xenophobia against Asian Americans, especially in light of the Covid pandemic. "I ran for president because I believe we're in a battle for the soul of this nation," Biden said before signing the actions. "And the simple truth is, our soul will be troubled as long as systemic racism is allowed to persist." "I firmly believe the nation is ready to change, but government has to change as well," he said. The actions are the latest in a sweeping first-week flex of presidential powers. Here's what Biden signed Tuesday afternoon, according to a preview provided by senior administration officials: "For too many American families, systemic racism and inequality in our economy, laws and institutions, still put the American dream far out of reach," domestic policy advisor Susan Rice said at a press briefing preceding Biden's speech and signings. "These are desperate times for so many Americans, and all Americans need urgent federal action to meet this moment," Rice said. "Building a more equitable economy is essential if Americans are going to compete and thrive in the 21st century." Rice noted in the briefing that Biden's order to the DOJ does not apply to private-prison contracts with other agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That order is "silent on what may or may not transpire with ICE facilities," she said, while stressing that the latest actions are "just the beginning" of the administration's racial equity push. Biden put racial justice issues at the center of his winning campaign against former President Donald Trump . Shortly after being sworn into office, Biden signed an executive order that established his administration's social-justice focus and revoked some of his predecessor's policies. Specifically, the Jan. 20 action canceled Trump's order limiting federal contractors' ability to hold workplace diversity and inclusion trainings, which was signed in September. Biden also ended the Trump administration's " 1776 Commission ," which produced a report highly critical of progressive ideologies in the final days of Trump's term. Biden's order put the Domestic Policy Council, led by Rice, in charge of coordinating "efforts to embed equity principles, policies, and approaches across the Federal Government." "This will include efforts to remove systemic barriers to and provide equal access to opportunities and benefits, identify communities the Federal Government has underserved, and develop policies designed to advance equity for those communities," that order said. Biden is scheduled to return to the State Dining Room at 4:45 p.m., when he will speak about his administration's efforts to contain the Covid pandemic. — CNBC's Christian Nunley contributed to this report.
Starbucks Chief Operating Officer Rosalind Brewer will replace Stefano Pessina as CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance, the drugstore chain confirmed Tuesday evening. Brewer will be the only Black woman leading a Fortune 500 company. Brewer has been with Starbucks since 2017. Her departure comes as investors, regulators and activists push for more diversity in corporate America.	Starbucks Chief Operating Officer Rosalind Brewer will replace Stefano Pessina as CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance , the drugstore chain confirmed in a statement Tuesday evening. Starbucks had announced Brewer's departure earlier in the day, saying she is leaving at the end of February for a CEO position at an undisclosed publicly traded company. As CEO of Walgreens, Brewer will be the only Black woman leading a Fortune 500 company. Her departure from Starbucks comes as investors, regulators and activists push for more diversity in corporate America. Nasdaq has proposed changes that would push for greater racial and gender diversity on the boards of publicly traded companies listed on its exchange. The Wall Street Journal first reported Brewer's decision to join Walgreens. Walgreens shares rose nearly 8% in extended trading on the news. The stock is down 5% over the past 12 months, bringing its market value to $42.50 billion. Pessina announced his plans to step down as CEO in July. He is one of the drugstore chain's largest individual investors and plans to continue to serve on the board as executive chairman. Brewer joined Starbucks' board in 2017 and became its chief operating officer later that year after serving as CEO of Sam's Club, which is owned by Walmart . She was the first Black woman to be COO of Starbucks and to head a division at the big-box retailer. Prior to her time at Walmart, she worked for consumer packaged goods giant Kimberly-Clark . In her current role, Brewer deals with a wide range of responsibilities, from technology initiatives to the creation of new coffee drinks. She was widely expected to be the successor to current CEO Kevin Johnson. After she leaves, her responsibilities will be split between CMO Brady Brewer and Rossann Williams, who serves as president of company-operated locations in the U.S. and Canada. At Walgreens, Brewer will face numerous challenges as the company looks to turn around its business and create new revenue streams. The drugstore chain struggled in the early months of the pandemic as foot traffic dropped, particularly at its Boots stores in the United Kingdom. The company reported earlier this month that sales were picking up but reiterated its outlook for low single-digit earnings growth. The drugstore chain has been cutting costs in some areas and investing in others. It closed hundreds of Walgreens and Boots stores last year and cut the size of its workforce. Walgreens' bigger rival, CVS Health , acquired health insurer Aetna and was quicker to expand in health-care services. CVS opened Minute Clinics, and Walgreens has been playing catch-up. Brewer also sits on the board of Amazon , a company that's been cutting into drugstore sales both in the front of the store as well as behind the pharmacy counter as more customers buy toothpaste and refill prescriptions online. Amazon launched its own pharmacy business in November , offering perks such as a savings program and free two-day delivery to Prime members. It acquired online pharmacy PillPack in 2018. Brewer also is chairwoman of Spelman College's board of trustees and previously was a director at Lockheed Martin and Molson Coors Beverage . Starbucks has also recently announced the retirement of its CFO, Pat Grismer . He will be replaced by Rachel Ruggeri, who serves as senior vice president of finance for the Americas division, starting Feb. 1. Shares of Starbucks fell more than 1% in extended trading on Tuesday after the chain reported its fiscal first-quarter results . It beat analyst estimates for its earnings, but its sales recovery in the U.S. faltered as Covid-19 cases increased during the quarter.
Walmart and the Walmart Foundation are distributing $14.3 million to nonprofit organizations that advance racial equity in education, health care and more. After George Floyd's killing, the big-box retailer pledged it would donate $100 million over five years to fight systemic racism. The company is looking within its four walls, too, such as examining how it hires and promotes employees.	In the wake of the George Floyd protests, Walmart pledged to boost diversity within its own ranks and contribute $100 million over five years to help fight systemic racism across the country. On Monday, the company gave an update on that effort. Walmart and its foundation will distribute the first $14.3 million to 16 nonprofit organizations. The grants will go toward groups that are tackling racial inequities in various ways, such as educating communities of color about the Covid-19 vaccines, reducing debt for students at historically Black colleges and universities and providing internet access and technology to children who are attending school remotely. Walmart is one of many companies that promised to throw its money and weight behind addressing racial disparities after Floyd's killing on Memorial Day. Yet as the country's largest employer and retailer, its actions have additional significance. CEO Doug McMillon also leads the Business Roundtable, a powerful corporate voice made up of many of the country's most prominent chief executives. When the company made its initial pledge in June, McMillon acknowledged that corporations — including Walmart — must do more than simply write checks . He said the company would do better within its four walls, too, by recruiting and supporting diverse talent. Black employees make up about 21% of Walmart's 1.5 million U.S. workforce, according the company's most recent diversity and inclusion report . However, that diversity fades in the top ranks of Walmart. About 12% of the company's managers and 7% of its officers are Black. Walmart tapped longtime employee Kirstie Sims to lead the company's Center for Racial Equity , which will focus on inequities in four key areas: finance, health care, education and criminal justice. Sims started working at the big-box retailer as a way to pay off student loans and planned to switch to the health-care industry. At Walmart, however, she said she discovered she could build a 20-plus year career and advance to leadership positions — something she hopes to make possible for other employees, including other Black women. Prior to her new role, she was senior director of global ethics and compliance at Walmart. Walmart has made other changes to advance racial equity in recent months. It will share a diversity and inclusion report twice a year instead of annually. It will work with the country's largest historically Black university, North Carolina A&T State University, to increase the number of Black college graduates entering highly demanded fields. It opened two new Walmart Health locations, which offer low-cost medical appointments, in Chicago in November. It also signed joined the One Ten Coalition, a group of U.S. companies pledging to train, hire and promote 1 million Black Americans over the next decade. Sims said Walmart is also looking at how its business practices can make a difference. For example, it can expand access to affordable medical care in needy communities by opening Walmart Health locations, elevate Black-owned businesses by using more as suppliers and give second chances to job applicants reentering society after involvement with the criminal justice system. "Progress sometimes is slow, but with the work and the power and the commitment behind it, we're going to make change," she said.
Goalsetter's Black History Month campaign will feature athletes selecting 100 minority youths and donating $40 saving accounts to each kid. Paul will jump-start the campaign by drafting kids from the Club 61 Leadership Alliance in his hometown, Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Goalsetter is a mobile banking app that offers peer-to-peer banking transactions. Users can also put funds on its Cashola debit card, which is backed by Mastercard.	Financial tech company Goalsetter has launched its Black History Month campaign alongside basketball star Chris Paul, who will help minorities learn how to save money. Featured athletes in the campaign will each select 100 youths and deposit $40 into savings accounts set up on the Goalsetter mobile banking app, the company told CNBC. Paul will jump-start the campaign by drafting kids from the Club 61 Leadership Alliance in his hometown, Winston-Salem, North Carolina. "Black History Month is a reminder of the hundreds of years that Black people have been a labor force and a consumer class in America," Paul said in a statement. "This partnership is about learning from our history to create a strong future that prepares the next generation of Black and Brown kids to be savers and investors. Financial education is a necessary and critical component of creating an equal America." Individuals from the National Basketball Players Association, the WNBA, Major League Baseball and National Hockey League will also be asked to support the campaign. Goalsetter is a mobile banking app that offers peer-to-peer banking transactions. Users can also put funds on its Cashola debit card, which is backed by Mastercard . The firm announced a $3.9 million seeding round last month. Paul is one of the investors. Former Nickelodeon executive Tanya Van Court is the founder and CEO of Goalsetter. In an interview with CNBC discussing its fundraising , Van Court said the app can help combat wealth inequality. The app offers saving lessons through financial literacy quizzes. Parents can set the debit card to lock on Sundays if younger users haven't completed the weekly tests. The campaign is dedicated to the " 40 acres and a mule " resolution in 1865, which promised newly freed slaves land. Then-President Andrew Johnson later overturned the order. "Every kid in America needs financial education to achieve success," said Van Court. "Goalsetter's smart banking app puts financial education front and center, and the NBPA's players are bringing that financial education to families on their home courts all across the country." Goalsetter said accounts with the $40 deposits are FDIC insured. The campaign is aiming to reach 1 million kids. "Our players have already started engaging with Goalsetter and using it with their own families," said Que Gaskins, the NBPA's chief brand and innovation officer. "We are excited about this opportunity to support them and working with Goalsetter to spark this movement around financial literacy for kids all over the country."
Ulta Beauty will double Black-owned brands on store shelves by the end of 2021, invest in media campaigns that feature Black women and expand employee training to fight unconscious bias. It will spend $25 million on the initiative, including more than $4 million toward marketing that fuels growth of Black-owned brands. Actress and beauty brand founder Tracee Ellis Ross will become the company's diversity and inclusion advisor.	Ulta Beauty unveiled an initiative Tuesday to better reflect the country's diversity with the products it sells in stores and faces it features in advertising campaigns. The beauty retailer pledged to double the Black-owned brands in its assortment by the end of 2021 and step up employee training to make stores more welcoming for all customers. The company will put more than $25 million toward the initiative. It also tapped Tracee Ellis Ross, actress and CEO and founder of hair-care brand Pattern Beauty, as its diversity and inclusion advisor to help counsel the company and hold it accountable. Over the past year, many companies have grappled with whether their business practices — including hiring, advertising and picking products to display — reinforce or fight systemic racism. George Floyd's killing and Black Lives Matter protests prompted a wave of corporate commitments to do more to address racial inequities. A growing number of major retailers has promised to step up their philanthropy and recruiting. and some, including Macy's and Gap , have signed on to the 15 Percent Pledge, which aims to make Black-owned products on store shelves proportional to the country's Black population. Ulta CEO Mary Dillon said the beauty industry, in particular, "ought to be leading." She said it plays a powerful role in shaping what society sees as beautiful and desirable. Plus, she said, more than 50% of babies born in the U.S. are non-Caucasian — a dynamic that will shape the customers of tomorrow and determine which brands stay relevant. "It's not only an opportunity, but an obligation that we represent everybody to celebrate diversity — if you look at our advertising campaigns, if you look at the photography in our [hair] salon, if you look at the way we're training our salon associates to work with every hair type," she said. "Meeting the needs of everybody of any age or race or skin tone or hair type" is core to Ulta's business. Diversity and inclusion efforts have become more of a business imperative rather than a goodwill gesture as shoppers pay more attention to corporate values like sustainability and diversity and vote with their dollars. That's something that Dillon said she has seen up close as chair of the Retail Industry Leaders Association. "Consumers now are holding businesses to a higher standard, and they should," Dillon said. Ulta will put about $20 million toward media investments across multicultural platforms aimed at reaching Black and Hispanic communities, such as TV commercials that feature Black women. It will spend more than $4 million to market and fuel growth of its Black-owned brands and about $2 million on quarterly, mandatory in-store employee training to fight unconscious bias. Ulta is also trying to expand staff diversity through recruiting efforts and the creation of a Diverse Leaders Program to offer executive mentorship to more than 30 employees who show potential to become company leaders. Ulta's beauty industry peer, LVMH -owned Sephora, announced a similar plan in mid-January to make its stores more inclusive. Among the changes, it said it would double its Black-owned brands and reduce the presence of third-party security. It also signed the 15 Percent Pledge.
The findings from the Green Park Business Leaders 2021 index showed that just 10 of the 297 people in the top three roles of FTSE 100 companies have ethnic minority backgrounds. The number of Black executive and non-executive directors on the boards of FTSE 100 companies had also fallen to 1.1% from 1.3% in the last six years.	LONDON — There are no Black executives in the role of chair, chief executive or chief financial officer at Britain's 100 biggest companies for the first time since 2014, according to a report on boardroom diversity. This was according to annual research released Wednesday by U.K. executive recruitment and diversity consultancy agency Green Park. The initial findings from the Green Park Business Leaders 2021 index, which looked at the background of 6,172 workers in the U.K., showed that just 10 of the 297 people, or just over 3%, in the top three roles of FTSE 100 companies have ethnic minority backgrounds. This was the same proportion as when Green Park started its analysis of FTSE 100 companies in 2014. Green Park said that while the number of workers from most other ethnic minority groups in those top positions had slightly increased in the last six years, the number of Black leaders had stalled and then fallen to zero. The number of Black executive and non-executive directors on the boards of FTSE 100 companies had also fallen to 1.1% from 1.3% in the last six years, Green Park said. The prospect of greater Black representation at the top of the some of the U.K.'s biggest companies in the future was also found to be diminishing. The percentage of Black employees in the leadership pipeline had fallen to 0.9% from 1.4% in the last year, while wider ethnic minority representation had declined to 9% from 10.7%. Trevor Phillips, chair of Green Park, said that the findings "put some flesh on the bone" of last year's Black Lives Matter protests. The international movement for racial justice led to a resurgence of protests in May and June last year, prompted in part by the killing of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor by police in the U.S. Phillips said there was no shortage of qualified candidates to fill these top roles in the FTSE 100. "Yet the snowy peaks of British business remain stubbornly white," he said. The data coincided with the U.K.'s first ever "Race Equality Week," which was co-founded by Green Park following last year's Black Lives Matter protests, with the slogan: "Let's not go back to normal." "Corporate leaders need to stop telling us how much they care and do something to show us that black lives really do matter," Phillips said.
During the pandemic, Black restaurant workers have received less in tips than other racial groups, according to a report by labor advocacy group One Fair Wage. Nearly 90% of Black workers reported their tips have declined by 50% or more, compared with 78% of all workers. The report found Black employees have been treated with more hostility by customers than others on average as a result of mandating the appropriate social distancing and mask rules.	As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities, Black workers in the restaurant industry are feeling the effects, according to a new report. During the pandemic, tips given to Black restaurant workers have declined more than have tips to workers in other racial groups, a report by labor advocacy group One Fair Wage says. Nearly 90% of Black workers have reported their tips have declined by 50% or more. By comparison, 78% of all workers said their tips had declined by that much. About 4,100 workers in five states and Washington, D.C., participated in the survey, which was conducted over the phone and via email from October through January. Although Black workers represent the majority of the tipped service industry, they are also the ones making the least, according to the report, which examined government data and its survey's findings, among other sources. Even prior to Covid-19, Black food service workers said they receive fewer tips on average than their White counterparts, with some earning as little as $10 an hour. Covid-19 has also been a continuing threat to their health and well-being. According to the survey, more Black employees knew someone who had contracted or died from the disease than others, putting Black workers at risk for Covid-19 at work and at home. Black workers, like other workers, reported an increase in sexual harassment during the pandemic, including #MaskualHarrassment, a term that describes male customers asking women to remove their mask and determining the amount of tips they give based on the woman's appearance. Forty percent of restaurant workers surveyed said they were victims of sexual harassment on the job during the pandemic. Eight in 10 workers have reported hostile reactions when enforcing health protocols, which have affected the amount of tips they receive. But slightly more Black workers, about 86%, have experienced this. "Sometimes if you ask a customer to put on a mask or step away a little, they get angry and go out their way to get closer to you or to touch you just to make you feel uncomfortable," a respondent said in the report. The report comes amid a growing discussion about raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour . President Joe Biden's proposal would more than double the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, which has not been increased since 2009. Correction: Eight in 10 workers have reported hostile reactions when enforcing health protocols. An earlier version of this story misstated who experienced this trend. Also, 78% of all workers said their tips had declined by at least 50%; an earlier version misstated this statistic.
Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd is set to take her dating app public this week in an important move for female founders. In 2021, female-led companies remain dramatically underfunded compared to their male-led counterparts. Commentators say greater diversity at the venture capital level could create more funding opportunities for women.	When 31-year-old Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd takes her company public this week, she will be noted not only for her youth but also as one of the few female founders to lead her company to IPO. It's a fitting feat for the founder of a dating app designed to put women in the driver's seat. But it also hammers home the still mismatched playing field for men and women entrepreneurs. Bumble, whose board comprises 73% women , is expected to begin trading Thursday on the Nasdaq, just days before Valentine's Day . The company will sell its stock at $43 per share, raising $2.2 billion from investors. The offering initially values the company at more than $7 billion. The market response will act as a litmus test for investments in companies founded by women. Today, women account for just 7.4% of Fortune 500 CEOs — an all-time high but still a staggeringly low figure. Female founders of public companies number even fewer. Nasdaq estimates that just 20 of today's active U.S. public companies were led through IPO by their female founder. The problem is not a lack of women entrepreneurs, but rather a lack of support where it matters: Funding. In a 2018 study, Boston Consulting Group found a "clear gender gap in new business funding." According to the research, investments in businesses founded or co-founded by women averaged $935,000, less than half the average $2.1 million received by men. Despite that, for every dollar of funding invested, start-ups founded and co-founded by women generated 78 cents while male-founded start-ups generated just 31 cents. The pandemic has only widened that gap. In 2020, global venture funding rose 13% from the previous year, yet investments in women fell 27%. Meantime, the share of dollars apportioned to female-only founders dropped from 2.8% to 2.3%, according to Crunchbase data. That comes as women, often primary caregivers, are said to be more adversely impacted by the pandemic overall. "Confluence of crises — demands for racial justice, #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, Covid-19, and an economic downturn — makes this a critical moment for corporate inclusion, equity and diversity," Matt Krentz, managing director and senior partner at BCG, and co-author of the study, told CNBC. "Of all these issues, Covid-19 may pose the largest threat to female founders." The economic benefits of investing in women are well documented. By some estimates, equal entrepreneurial participation by men and women could add $5 trillion to the global economy . And corporations and institutions now appear to be listening. Many have made bold commitments to better support gender equality and female founders. "Awareness of the funding gap, the impact of diverse leadership teams is better understood and investors have started asking directly about the diversity in founders and leadership teams," said Krentz. But too often those investments are poorly channeled, according to Tanya Rolfe, managing partner at Her Capital, a female-led venture capital firm focused on female founders in Southeast Asia. "Women seem to be the focus of lots of additional mentoring, which only suggests that there is something lacking in women," said Rolfe. "What women founders need is simple, and it is equal access to financial investment." To achieve that, greater diversity is needed at the fund manager level, said Rolfe. In 2020, women accounted for just 13% of all venture capital decision-makers, according to All Raise , a nonprofit that focuses on accelerating the success of female founders and funders. An estimated 11% of fund managers were women , All Raise said. "If we want to see diversity at the founder level, we must invest in diversity at capital allocator level — the fund manager, like me," Rolfe continued. "It is almost more important to invest in venture capital funds with specific strategies of investing into diverse founders. This is where we will see the material change." Yet diverse funds continue to face an uphill battle. With many still in their infancy and with little track record, they typically fall outside of institutions' investment criteria, leading managers to seek often less lucrative and more time-consuming deals from private investors. Pippa Lamb, a partner at early-stage investment fund Sweet Capital, says that kind of approach needs a revamp. "Pricing perceived risk based on someone's race or gender feels very outdated to me," said Lamb. "I would suspect that best-in-class institutional investors are willing to do the work to comprehensively diligence managers regardless of what they look like." "We need more diverse representation in every area of the start-up ecosystem," she said, citing female founders, female board members, female venture capitalists and female institutional investors. "When it comes to capital raising, the latter two are most critical, and especially at the limited partner (LP) level: the investor's investors." Krentz from BCG is hopeful that the tide may be turning. "Investors should understand that current market forces make women-owned companies very promising opportunities," he said. "The lack of funding means that there is less competition for women-backed companies, and those companies, on average, perform better than those with all-male founders." But until that understanding grows, Rolfe and Lamb's advice to female founders is simple: Keep on keeping on. "Women can do the same things that male founders do to attract investors," said Rolfe. "If you are an outstanding founder with a solid business plan and traction to prove your execution and thesis, then this should be enough."
CVS Health and Walgreens will play a bigger role in the Covid vaccine effort as a federal program ships doses to retail pharmacies. The rollout will test the major pharmacy chains' commitment to expanding health-care access in Black and Hispanic communities. For vaccine distribution, equity is not only a matter of fairness. It's also a crucial way to slow the spread in communities where Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are higher.	Dr. Virginia Banks says if the U.S. really wants to bring the pandemic to an end, it's going to take mobile vans of vaccines in neighborhoods where people don't have transportation — and even giving shots at hair salons and barber shops. As thousands of pharmacies get shipments of doses and start vaccinations at their stores this week , the country is taking a significant step toward reaching more Americans. Public health officials and advocates, however, say that won't go far enough in communities where people have been the sickest. More Black and Hispanic Americans have been hospitalized and died from Covid-19. They often face bigger barriers to get vaccine, too: A lack of transportation. A juggle of multiple jobs. Hesitance because of past mistreatment by the medical community. CVS Health and Walgreens will play a bigger role in the effort as a federal program ships doses to more of their stores and those of other retail pharmacies. The expansion represents a business opportunity for the nation's two largest pharmacy chains as they get paid for each vaccine and draw more foot traffic to stores. The vaccine rollout will also test the companies' commitment to expanding health-care access in Black and Hispanic communities. Banks, an infectious disease doctor in Ohio, is part of an interest group of the Infectious Diseases Society of America that's made up of Black physicians, scientists and public health officials focused on addressing health-care disparities. She said health-care providers will have to get creative and show commitment. She said they should set up clinics in familiar places, such as churches, and enlist "trusted messengers" like pastors and community leaders. "You've got to look at from a cultural standpoint 'Where are we?' and come to us," she said. The vaccine's rollout in the U.S. has been slow and complex. Demand for doses has far outweighed the number of shots available to jab into arms . Online appointment systems have been tricky to navigate and bogged down by heavy traffic. Only two vaccines have emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration so far, and they must stored at cold and ultra-cold temperatures. And only some Americans qualify for the shot, with each state having slightly different criteria to weigh factors like a person's age, medical conditions or job. About 48.4 million vaccines have been administered in the U.S. as of Friday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Nearly 12.1 million people have received both doses of the vaccine — just a small fraction of the 331 million people who live in the U.S. The country's goal is to vaccinate between 70% and 85% of the U.S. population — or roughly 232 million to 281 million people — to achieve herd immunity, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president's chief medical advisor. The messy rollout has led to some getting shots and not others. Most of the nearly 13 million people given at least one shot of a Covid-19 vaccine within the first month of the drugs' distribution were women, age 50 or older and likely non-Hispanic and White, according to a CDC study . For vaccine distribution, equity is not only a matter of fairness. It's also a crucial way to slow the spread in communities where Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are higher. Black and Hispanic Americans are 3.7 times and 4.1 times more likely be hospitalized from Covid than White Americans, according to data reported by the CDC in late November. Both of the minority groups are 2.8 times more likely than White Americans to die from the disease. In a hard-hit neighborhood, each shot's impact can be even greater — reaching people who are more at risk as they work in grocery stores or at other frontline jobs or live in a dense apartment or multigenerational households. Vaccine hesitance is higher among Black and Brown people , too, stemming from the medical community's history of mistreating minority groups and opening fewer health-care practices in their neighborhoods. A poll of New York residents, conducted by the Association for a Better New York, found that 78% of White residents would take the vaccine as soon as they could compared with 39% of Black residents, 54% of Hispanics and 54% of Asians. For providers like CVS and Walgreens, having more doses of the vaccine is a business opportunity. They will get paid for each vaccine and the government will pick up the cost if a person does not have health insurance. Jefferies estimated that each shot will have a $13 to $15 gross margin and could yield about $1 billion in incremental gross profits for CVS over the next year. Both drugstore chains have pinned their strategy on adding more health-care services from primary care clinics to diabetes screenings. They have also stepped up commitments to address racial inequities in response to George Floyd's killing and nationwide protests. CVS plans to invest nearly $600 million over five years to support public policy initiatives and internal efforts, such as mentoring Black employees and offering free health screenings for blood pressure and cholesterol at stores. Walgreens started a pilot project in the Chicago area that aims to reduce hospitalization rates by making it easier for patients to take their medications, get free deliveries of prescriptions and have more regular contact with health-care professionals about their medical conditions. It recently hired former Starbucks Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer as its next CEO. When she steps into the role in mid-March, she will be only Black woman leading a Fortune 500 company. Karyne Jones,  CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based National Caucus and Center on Black Aging , said expanding vaccines to hard-hit communities is a way for CVS and Walgreens to "put their money where their mouth is." Her organization is a founding member of the Covid-19 Vaccine Education and Equity Project , a coalition of nonprofits and trade groups that's backed by vaccine-maker Pfizer . Jones said she would like to see CVS and Walgreens open 24-hour vaccination sites and set up tents in neighborhoods where people don't have transportation. "If you really want to show good corporate responsibility, this is the time to say we have got to put resources toward alleviating this pandemic," she said. Banks, the infectious disease doctor, said it will take outside-of-the-box strategies, such as rerouting bus routes to go by vaccine clinics. She pointed to an effort where pharmacists paired up with barber shops to detect high blood pressure when Black men went for a haircut — a clinical study that helped detect the condition and intervene earlier. She said she's hopeful that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — which requires just one dose and can be transported more easily — could be a game changer for distribution and make it easier to give shots where people are. The company requested emergency use authorization from the FDA last week. "We have pharmacy deserts," she said. "We have grocery store deserts. We don't have church deserts." Walgreens and CVS have given Covid vaccines at thousands of nursing homes and assisted living facilities . They have administered shots at some stores after getting vaccine doses from states. With the federal program, they will offer shots in more neighborhoods. Walgreens has Covid vaccines at stores in 15 states and two additional jurisdictions, New York City and Chicago. It will provide shots in 1,800 stores as part of the federal program — or roughly 20% of its U.S. stores, a company spokeswoman said. CVS has them in 18 states and Puerto Rico. As of Friday, about 420 of its approximately 9,900 stores will give the shots with doses from either a state or the federal program, a company spokesman said. Both pharmacy chains said they have chosen stores in neighborhoods with greater need. About half of each companies' stores with Covid vaccines are located in medically underserved areas or places that rank high on the CDC's social vulnerability index, which is based on factors like the prevalence of poverty, lack of vehicle access and crowded housing. Walgreens will also allow people to schedule appointments in person or by phone, so people are not excluded if they don't have internet or a computer, said Rina Shah, Walgreens group vice president of pharmacy operations. CVS has a 1-800 number as its alternative to booking online. Walgreens struck a partnership with Uber to provide free rides to vaccine appointments to people who live in underserved parts of major cities , such as Atlanta and Chicago. Charitable partners will help identify people who need transportation. CVS is taking proactive steps to make sure locals can get vaccine appointments at their nearby store, said Chris Cox, the company's senior vice president of pharmacy. He said staff are calling some customers to schedule their appointments, particularly those who are lower income and older. Along with enlisting pharmacies, the Biden administration will ship doses to community health centers next week that serve millions of Americans who live below the poverty line and are racial minorities. The vaccination program allows CVS to powerfully demonstrate how it can provide health care in places where it typically is not accessible, Cox said. "Everything we do is really with the intent of helping people on their path to better health," he said. "What this opportunity really gives us is to demonstrate to our patients and to other stakeholders what we've been saying for several years, which is that community pharmacy has a big role to play in health care." Many patients see their pharmacists more often than their doctors since they need to pick up high blood pressure pills or other maintenance prescriptions, he said. Those frequent interactions mean that CVS can play a larger role in making sure people take their medications properly or can intervene before potential complications. As Walgreens gets more supply, Shah said it will expand its hours and offer shots on weekends for people who can't skip a day of work. It will open clinics at community centers, like it does for flu shots. Shah said its pharmacists can play a key role as they educate and answer questions, so people are eager for the shots rather than apprehensive. But, she said, the company ultimately needs more supply to reach more people in minority communities. "Our biggest opportunity is getting more vaccine," she said.
In October, her WTO candidacy was supported by all geographic regions at the trade body apart from the United States. Okonjo-Iweala has said she can take hardship, having experienced Nigeria's brutal civil war during her teenage years. When serving as Nigeria's finance minister, kidnappers demanded Okonjo-Iweala resign after taking her mother hostage.	Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has been appointed the new chief of the World Trade Organization , becoming the first woman to ever lead the Switzerland-based institution and the first African citizen to take on the role. However, this is not the first time that Okonjo-Iweala makes history. Born in Nigeria, Okonjo-Iweala graduated from Harvard University in 1976 and then earned a PhD from MIT. She then became the first woman to take on the Nigerian finance ministry and the foreign ministry too. She was also the first female to run for the World Bank presidency, where she spent 25 years. In October, her WTO candidacy was supported by all geographic regions at the trade body apart from the United States, where the then-Trump administration said it would continue backing the Korean candidate. However, Okonjo-Iweala's appointment was cleared when President Joe Biden announced a few days ago his support for the 66-year old. The WTO is at a crossroads after many countries seemed to take a step back from long-standing norms governing international trade. In addition, its appellate body has been paralyzed for months after the U.S. — again, under the Trump administration — prevented the appointment of new judges therefore rendering it unable to rule on any trade disputes. "My vision is also of a rejuvenated and strengthened WTO that will be confident to tackle effectively ongoing issues," Okonjo-Iweala told WTO members during a hearing in July. "It is clear that a rules-based system without a forum in which a breach of the rules can be effectively arbitrated loses credibility over time," she said at the same hearing. Officials in the European Union and the United States have previously said the WTO needs to be reformed and its rules updated, but there is no consensus on how to do it. "The WTO appears paralyzed at a time when its rule book would greatly benefit from an update to 21st century issues such as ecommerce and the digital economy, the green and circular economies," Okonjo-Iweala said. She is also likely to support female participation in global trade, having said that "greater efforts should be made to include women-owned enterprises in the formal sector." Okonjo-Iweala has said she can take hardship, having experienced Nigeria's brutal civil war during her teenage years, during which her family reportedly lost all their savings. "I can take hardship. I can sleep on the cold floor anytime," she told the BBC in an interview in 2012. When serving as Nigeria's finance minister, kidnappers demanded Okonjo-Iweala resign after taking her mother hostage. She refused to comply and they ended up releasing her mother a few days later, the BBC reported. She has also been involved in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, being the African Union's special envoy on the matter. Okonjo-Iweala has been a board member of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance — a public-private health partnership immunizing people in poorer countries.
JPMorgan's Chase Bank will double its Chase Homebuyer Grant in an effort to foster homeownership among Black and Latino communities. Qualified homebuyers across the country can now receive a $5,000 grant when purchasing a home through the bank. "I daydreamed," said new homeowner Marcia Hernandez when asked about her grant. "It secured me from worrying in the future. I was shocked."	The early days of Guadalupe Mora's search for a new home were exhausting. A health-care technician at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, Mora slowly saved up more than $15,000 to move out of her two-bedroom mobile home and into a new place she picked out with her real estate agent. But the lender she had first contacted started to hound her day and night, pressing her with demands for even more cash and other proof she would be able to pay off a loan. A single mother to a 12-year-old who "thinks he knows it all," Mora said the lender's agents would harass her with messages even when she made it clear she could not return texts while at work. "It was, seriously, so stressful. It was horrible," she told CNBC last week during her lunch break. "I work 12-hour shifts. I cannot — especially when I'm working in the Covid unit — it's impossible for me to be on my phone constantly." The lender "just did not understand that I knew I needed the house — and I wanted the house. But I needed to keep my job in order to buy the house," she added. So, when Mora finally applied for a mortgage through Chase Bank, the 45-year-old learned she qualified for its $2,500 Homebuyer Grant, one of the bank's programs designed to help customers finance the purchase of a home. The grant is just one of several assistance options U.S. banks have deployed in recent years to foster homeownership among Black and Latino communities that have historically faced higher hurdles when applying for a mortgage. To further advance that goal, Chase Bank announced on Tuesday that it will double its Chase Homebuyer Grant. Chase, the U.S. consumer and commercial banking business of JPMorgan Chase , said qualified homebuyers in predominantly Black neighborhoods across the country can now receive a $5,000 grant when purchasing a home through the bank. While that sum may represent a fraction of the price of a home, it can help cover a substantial portion of an applicant's down payment or closing costs, often the largest hurdles for new homebuyers. Chase's move to boost the Homebuyer Grant comes just over four months after the bank pledged $30 billion to help address U.S. wealth inequality , especially in historically underserved Black and Latino communities. The bank pledged to use the $30 billion to finance an additional 100,000 affordable housing units and write 40,000 new home-purchase loans for Black and Latino households. Still, housing advocates say the bank programs are overdue after decades of redlining, the subprime mortgage crisis and risky high-interest loans to Americans with a short or tarnished credit history. Many banks announced their new mortgage assistance programs in the months after the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer and weeks of Black Lives Matter protests across the country. Black homeownership levels are especially low and have consistently trailed those of other minority groups and White households. In the first quarter of 2020, 44% of Black families owned their home, compared with 73.7% of non-Hispanic White families, according to data from the Census Bureau. By the fourth quarter, that difference had widened slightly to 44.1% for Black families and 74.5% for White families. Black households saw homeownership rates slump to 40.6% in 2019, the lowest level for the demographic going back through Census data dated 1994. Though Black homeownership has recovered somewhat since then, the impact of Covid-19 and the subsequent recession kept downward pressure on the rate of Black homeownership throughout 2020. Cerita Battles, head of the Chase community and affordable lending team, told CNBC she believes lenders need to play a proactive role in working to reduce those disparities. "Absolutely yes. We should be a part of the solution," Battles said Thursday. "I think about myself, being someone that is Black," she continued. "There were times when I bought my first home — I couldn't go to my parents and ask them for dollars to support me in my down payment. And I didn't have a whole lot of wealth to begin with because of the different jobs that I had, and how I had to come up." Battles said she and her husband, who is a veteran, received a significant portion of the funds to purchase their first home through a loan backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Banks often offer more favorable lending terms to applicants who qualify for a VA loan since the department guarantees a portion of the mortgage. Similar initiatives are underway at Bank of America , which announced on Feb. 3 that it would invest $15 billion in affordable housing programs over the next five years, tripling its prior commitment. Steve Boland, president of BofA's retail business, told CNBC at the time that demand for its initial $5 billion pledge was so robust that applicants had quickly exhausted the allotment. "We see the need. We got great response from our clients. And so we thought it was appropriate to try to triple that and get that done to 60,000 homeowners by 2025," he said. Though the industry has received praise for its attempts to prioritize homeownership among minority communities, the programs come after years of criticism from advocacy groups that say big banks for decades worsened racial discrimination in the U.S. housing market. Codified racial bias in the U.S. housing market dates back nearly a century, when government officials openly engaged in a practice known as redlining. Starting around the 1930s, surveyors would outline and grade neighborhoods in hundreds of U.S. cities to determine which were safe enough to finance. Communities that included more people of color were more often deemed credit risks and, by extension, denied a variety of financial services, including mortgages. Though Congress outlawed redlining in the 1960s, recent housing research shows that the uneasy relationship between the Black community and the lending industry was fraught well into the 21st century. In the early 2000s, Black households were disproportionately targeted with dicey subprime loans, leading to the foreclosure of more than 240,000 homes owned by Black people and a foreclosure rate nearly double that of White people. In a 2016 complaint, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleged that BancorpSouth unlawfully denied Memphis-area Black applicants certain mortgage loans and overcharged some of its Black customers. The complaint asserted that the bank required its employees to review applications from minorities more quickly than others, and not to provide them the opportunity to receive credit assistance that might have improved their chances of getting a loan. A more recent study from the University of California at Berkeley found that Black and Latino applicants continue to face higher borrowing costs. The 2019 study, which reviewed 7 million, 30-year mortgages, found that Latino and Black borrowers "pay 0.079% and 0.036% percentage points more in interest for home-purchase and refinance mortgages, respectively, because of discrimination." Lenders contend that these differences reflect the fact that minorities generally have less cash on hand and lower credit scores. Critics argue the disparities represent historical and structural problems that banks ought to help solve. Acknowledging that turbulent history, Battles said a key first step in correcting the homeownership statistics is to try to guarantee that Black and Latino communities are aware of the new financial services available to them. "There are a lot of different things, I would say, that lenders can do to support this effort," Battles said. And that, she said, starts with building trust in each community. "We have to make sure that we're hiring people that mirror the markets we're seeking to serve," she added. "It is important for us to make sure that we have folks that are out there that can cultivate relationships and win the trust and consideration of these customers and these communities." Marcia Hernandez, just married in August, says her years of history as a Chase customer was key when she and her partner, Vivian, started looking for a new home in a quieter neighborhood in the Miami area. "For years I have had Chase and I first started with my lending," she said. "I educated myself a little more online and I ended up submitting a prequalification and I got a call within the same day." The 31-year-old says she worked with a home lending advisor at Chase to determine a reasonable budget and the resources available to her. Though Hernandez wasn't eligible for a grant initially, a representative for the bank said it recently told her she had been awarded its new $5,000 grant. "I daydreamed," she said when asked about the grant. "It secured me from worrying in the future. I was shocked. I couldn't believe it." "It opened room for other projects," she added. Hernandez, scheduled to close on her house on Tuesday, said she's eager to repaint the walls and add plants to her new home.
"I'm suggesting that we start calling February ... 'Black history, Black futures,'" BET founder Robert Johnson told CNBC on Tuesday. Johnson said he hopes to see more focus placed on what Black Americans could accomplish if they had equal economic opportunity. "Don't deny history, but it's better to know where you're going than where you've been," Johnson said.	BET founder Robert Johnson told CNBC on Tuesday that he believes Black History Month should put more focus on what's needed to deliver equal economic opportunities in the years ahead. "I'm suggesting that we start calling February ... 'Black history, Black futures,'" Johnson said in an interview on "Squawk Box." "Let Black Americans talk about what they want to achieve in the future for their country and their families. And let White Americans talk about what they're prepared to do and what they're willing to do or what they're doing, to make the future brighter for Black Americans." Every U.S. president since Gerald Ford in 1976 has officially recognized February as Black History Month. However, according to the Association for the Study of African American Life and History , the origins of Black History Month stretch back to 1915. That's when ASALH was founded by historian Carter G. Woodson , who nine years later designated one week in February to be explicitly focused on studying Black history. In 1976, after continued growing interest, ASALH worked to expand it to an entire month focused on Black History, according to its website. Woodson, the son of former slaves, has become known as the Father of Black History . Johnson said the need to study and recognize Black history remains critically important for all Americans. But Johnson said he believes a greater emphasis ought to be placed on "Black futures." "Don't deny history, but it's better to know where you're going than where you've been," said Johnson, who founded Black Entertainment Television in 1980. He became America's first Black billionaire in 2001 when BET's holding company was sold to Viacom . 'We've told the story over and over again of Black achievements against the odds," added Johnson. "Now we need to start talking about what could Black people contribute to this country if they had a future as bright economically as the future is for White Americans." Johnson has previously called on the U.S. government to issue $14 trillion of reparations for slavery as a way to help reduce the racial wealth gap in the country . He made the comments on CNBC in June, as protests against racial inequality and police brutality swept the nation following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. "Wealth transfer is what's needed," Johnson said at time, making his case for why reparations are needed. "Think about this. Since 200-plus-years or so of slavery, labor taken with no compensation, is a wealth transfer. Denial of access to education, which is a primary driver of accumulation of income and wealth, is a wealth transfer." President Joe Biden has repeatedly stressed that his administration wants to reduce racial inequality . According to a Federal Reserve study released in September , White families had a median wealth of $188,200, while it was $24,100 for Black families and $36,100 for Hispanic families. Johnson suggested Tuesday that to make progress on his goal, Biden should prioritize programs that direct capital to help foster Black entrepreneurship. "Black businesses tend to hire Black people as a whole, so you create more Black businesses, the bounce back is going to more Black jobs," Johnson said. "More Black jobs mean more Black people paying for home ownership, Black people ... saving for retirement, Black people investing. In the end result, we make a giant step toward closing the huge wealth gap." Watch the full interview Tuesday with Robert Johnson below:
Former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi has called the coming decades "the decades of women" as economies move into a new phase of growth. The Indian-American businesswoman said Covid-19 has served to change the playing field for women at work. Nooyi shared her three-step advice for helping companies and countries create a more inclusive environment for women.	As economies move into a new phase of growth, the next 20 years will be "the decades of women," says former PepsiCo Chief Executive Indra Nooyi . The Indian-American businesswoman said the coming years mark an inflection point for women as society seeks to recover from the pandemic while simultaneously addressing demographic challenges. She also urged companies and countries to get behind the change. "I don't believe there's any economy in the world that can be successful without tapping into the incredible potential of women going forward. I just don't believe that's possible," said Nooyi, a regular fixture among the ranks of the world's most powerful women. "I also think almost every economy in the world needs women to have children too, because we need the replacement rate for the world," she continued. "We ought to sit down and say to ourselves: 'They need us.' They need us for the economy, they need us to have kids, and we put in all the unpaid labor so far. So I look at the next couple decades and say 'it's our time.'" Nooyi was speaking at a virtual event organized by Procter & Gamble and United Nations Women entitled #WeSeeEqual. In a report last year, the UN predicted that the coronavirus pandemic has more adversely impacted women than men, further exacerbating existing gender disparities. However, Nooyi — who was widely praised for her transformation of PepsiCo, including its diversity and inclusion agenda — said companies and countries have the opportunity to help reduce the gap by focusing on three key areas. "First, every company and every government should insist on paid leave," she said, highlighting paid maternity, paternity, and family leave as critical. "Secondly, thank God for Covid, now we have flexibility," she continued, noting that flexible work can open up huge participation opportunities for women. That doesn't just mean shifting the office to the home, but enabling hybrid work models and flexi-time so workers can "find a new equation" that works for them, she said. "The third most important is childcare facilities," she said. Those three elements have to work in tandem to create change, said Nooyi. But she's hopeful: "I would say it's going to be a different world; there's going to be a lot more equality than we saw before."
By 2025, the company aims to have at least 35% of its senior-director and higher leadership roles be held by people from historically underrepresented groups. The fast-food giant also said it will push to have women represent at least 45% of its top ranks.	McDonald's said Thursday it is taking steps to increase the number of women and people from historically underrepresented groups in its senior leadership ranks. By 2025, the company aims to have at least 35% of its senior-director and higher leadership roles be held by people from minorities. That would be a 6% increase from 2020, McDonald's said. The fast-food giant also said it will push to have women represent at least 45% of its top ranks by 2025, an 8% increase from 2020. McDonald's is seeking total gender parity for leadership positions by the end of 2030. According to the company's 2018 data filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, women accounted for 32% of its executive or senior-level managers. About a third of people in these roles identified as Black, Hispanic or Asian, the data showed. Executive vice presidents will have their compensation tied to annual goals. McDonald's' board has endorsed the targets, which apply to the highest levels of the company. Starting in 2021, 15% of executive bonuses will be based on human-capital metrics. Systemwide sales and operating income growth will account for 42.5% of the company's incentive plans. Senior leadership team members are also taking steps to create diverse candidate slates for all open roles by engaging with internal and external diversity groups. They are also moving to mentor and sponsor more women and minorities. McDonald's announced plans in July to make commitments to diversity and inclusion , following international protests against racism and police brutality. The company also hired Reginald J. Miller as its chief diversity officer in November. McDonald's has faced accusations of racism at all levels of the company in the past year. Two Black executives sued the fast-food chain in January 2020 , claiming it shifted advertising away from Black customers. The suit also alleges McDonald's graded Black franchisees' stores more harshly than White operators' locations. The company is also facing three lawsuits from current and former Black franchisees , who allege they were steered toward inner-city locations that have lower sales and were then pushed out. In the past four years, at least 50 of its restaurant workers have filed sexual harassment complaints with the EEOC or in state courts. Shares of McDonald's have fallen about 1% in the last year, giving it a market value of about $159 billion.
Russell Westbrook led a $63 million funding round to become an investor in Varo Bank. The NBA star will also serve as an advisor to the financial tech firm to improve banking relations with minority communities.	National Basketball Association star Russell Westbrook has joined financial tech firm Varo Bank as a new investor after the company raised $63 million in a new funding round. Varo Bank announced the funding round on Thursday, adding Westbrook's investment was made through his enterprise firm. Investment company Jefferies Group advised Westbrook in the transition. Terms of Westbrook's investment were not made available. Varo, a digitally-focused bank, said the funds would be used to "further develop the product roadmap, including additional credit, savings, and transaction banking features." In 2020, Varo became the first consumer-focused fintech company to get approval from the FDIC , so it's considered a national bank and allowed it to take customer deposits. Previously, the fintech firm was valued at $417.8 million, according to Pitchbook. "We see it as a pretty big moat," Varo Money CEO Colin Walsh told CNBC last February when discussing the approval. "It was a long process – for this to finally see daylight is a big deal for the industry." Westbrook, 32, will also be an advisor to the bank and focus his efforts to improving income inequality issues via Varo-driven programs targeting minority communities. He also wants to strengthen banking relations with the Black community. "The banking system has ignored or underserved a large portion of the American population – particularly communities of color," Westbrook said in a statement. "I'm passionate about making lasting social change and creating a stronger and more inclusive system. I am excited and ready to work with Varo to be a part of an economic revitalization for those who never had the access they deserved." In his first year with the Washington Wizards, Westbrook is averaging 18.9 points, 9.4 rebounds and 9.5 assists. Westbrook is earning roughly $41 million this season , which is part of a five-year $206 million extension he signed with the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2017. "The Varo team is thrilled Russell is joining us on our trailblazing journey as the only all-digital, mission-driven national bank in the country," added Walsh. "We both share a view that banking can be – and needs to be – a force for good.  Russell is a visionary and his energy and passion for design, product excellence, and community impact will help propel Varo's next phase of growth."
Twitter is committing to having at least a quarter of its executives be underrepresented minorities and women by 2025. Approximately 13% of Twitter's current leadership employees are Black, Latinx, Indigenous or multiracial, according to the company's most recent inclusion and diversity report. Women make up 38.2% of the company's global leadership, according to the report.	Twitter on Thursday committed to increasing the diversity among its leadership by setting a goal of having at least a quarter of its executives be underrepresented minorities and women by 2025. The company announced the new goal as part of the 25 x 25 pledge, an initiative by Silicon Valley Leadership Group to increase diversity among companies in the San Francisco Bay Area. Approximately 13% of Twitter's current leadership employees are Black, Latinx, Indigenous or multiracial, according to the company's most recent inclusion and diversity report . Women make up 38.2% of the company's global leadership, according to the report. The company said it is committing to having women make up at least 41% of its global leadership roles and having at least 25% of its U.S. executives be underrepresented minorities. That means employees who are Black, Latinx, Native American, Alaskan or Hawaiian/Pacific Islander or multiracial. Correction: An earlier version of this story said Twitter set a goal of having at least a quarter of its executives be underrepresented minorities. The company is committing to having at least a quarter of its executives be women or underrepresented minorities.
Companies will commit to improving Black representation within their workforces once a failure to do so hurts their stock, according to BET founder Robert Johnson. "Tie all of those factors to achieving opportunities in employment at all levels for Black Americans, I think then you'll see results," he told CNBC on Monday. "They respond to financial factors and market conditions," he said.	BET founder Robert Johnson told CNBC on Monday he believes companies will more seriously address racial inequality within their workforces once a failure to do so starts impacting their stock price. "Companies understand return on investment capital. They understand return on equity. They understand total shareholder return," Johnson said on "Closing Bell." "Tie all of those factors to achieving opportunities in employment at all levels for Black Americans, I think then you'll see results because that's what companies understand. They respond to financial factors and market conditions." Johnson's comments follow the release of a new report on Black employment in the U.S. private sector from consulting giant McKinsey & Company. Drawing on data from 24 companies that together account for 3.7 million workers, the McKinsey report found notable disparities in Black representation in management roles. Black Americans are 12% of the overall private-sector workforce, but at the companies participating in the McKinsey report, they were only 7% of employees at the managerial level. Black representation dips to 4% to 5% at the senior manager, vice president and senior VP levels, according to the report . "On the current trajectory, it will take about 95 years for Black employees to reach talent parity (or 12 percent representation) across all levels in the private sector," the report states. Johnson said in his opinion, the only way firms will seriously work to address employment gaps, particularly for senior roles, is for there to be "accountability for companies for failure to commit to end" the disparities. "I think there are ways to do it," said Johnson, who founded Black Entertainment Television in 1980. A little more than two decades later, in 2001, he became America's first Black billionaire when BET's holding company was acquired by Viacom . He now sits on the board of Discovery and is founder and chairman of RLJ Companies. Johnson said one way to deliver accountability on fixing racial disparities in employment is by establishing it as a goal in corporate charters . "Shareholders should hold them accountable for it once it's in their charter," Johnson said, adding that proxy advisory firms like Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis could "look at the whole concept of a 'no' vote against companies that fail to commit to this kind of racial parity or basically closing the employment gap." Johnson said companies of all sizes also should commit to something akin to the NFL's Rooney Rule, which the league expanded last year in a bid to improve diversity within its coaching ranks. Teams now have to interview at least two external minority candidates for head-coaching jobs, up from at least one since it was first adopted in 2003. Additionally, the rule was broadened to require teams to interview at least one external minority candidate for open coordinator positions; there had been no diversity mandate covering those roles previously. NFL franchises could be fined for failing to comply with the Rooney Rule, Johnson noted. "I'm not sure we want to fine corporations because they could easily be able to pay the fine," he cautioned. "I think there should be some sort of moral equivalent that if you fail to do it, you are singled out and your stock is reported as failing in that, causing certain people who believe in this form of racial equity and racial equality to take their investments other places." Last year, Nasdaq submitted a proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission focused on improving diversity among corporate boards . The proposal from the exchange operator would require the majority of companies to have at least two board members who are diverse: one woman and one person who is LGBTQ or an underrepresented minority. Under the proposal, companies could ultimately be delisted from the stock exchange if they failed to publish board data. In December, at the time the proposal was made public, over 75% of the roughly 3,200 Nasdaq-listed companies failed to meet the requirement, according to the New York Times . Johnson has previously offered suggestions on how to address the racial wealth gap in the U.S. In a CNBC interview earlier this month , Johnson stressed the need to foster Black entrepreneurship in America through capital allocation programs. "Black businesses tend to hire Black people as a whole, so you create more Black businesses, the bounce back is going to more Black jobs," Johnson said. "More Black jobs mean more Black people paying for home ownership, Black people ... saving for retirement, Black people investing. In the end result, we make a giant step toward closing the huge wealth gap." A report from Citigroup last year found racial inequality cost the U.S. economy $16 trillion over the last two decades .
JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday announced its latest set of initiatives to further support Minority Depository Institutions and diverse-led Community Development Financial Institutions. They're part of the bank's $30 billion commitment to help address wealth inequality. JPMorgan Chase announced its initiative last October, following the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.	JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday announced its latest round of initiatives to support banks and credit unions that are primarily owned or directed by people of color, as well as banking institutions that work with underserved communities. It's part of JPMorgan's $30 billion commitment to help address wealth inequality. "These new initiatives are focused on strengthening minority-owned and diverse-led financial institutions by providing additional access to capital, connections to institutional investors, specialty support for Black-led commercial projects and mentorship and training opportunities," the bank said in a news release. JPMorgan announced its initiative last October, following the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has also highlighted longstanding systemic health and social inequities . "Systemic racism is a tragic part of America's history," Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, said in a statement at the time. "We can do more and do better to break down systems that have propagated racism and widespread economic inequality, especially for Black and Latinx people." Historically, banks have contributed to inequality through now-banned practices such as redlining . JPMorgan's peers, such as Bank of America and Citigroup , also made billion-dollar commitments to reduce inequality. As part of its latest slew of efforts, JPMorgan Chase said it's invested and committed the first $40 million of its $50 million equity pledge to Black and Latinx-led minority depository institutions. The firm added that it's also established a racial equity program, by providing New Markets Tax Credit investment pricing for Black-led, Black-owned and Black-serving nonprofits and businesses. This tax credit provides investors a tax incentive for investing in low-income communities. JPMorgan said it will help direct financing from the tax credit to community projects, including shelters, healthcare clinics and small businesses. The bank is also launching "Empowering Change," which it called a "unique program supported by Google and in partnership with minority depository institutions and diverse-led community development financial institutions to provide economic opportunity to underserved communities." "Google is anchoring the program's launch with an intent to invest $500 million in the Empower money market share class that will be initially distributed by diverse-led MDIs The Harbor Bank of Maryland, Liberty Bank and Trust, M&F Bank and Unity National Bank," the company said. JPMorgan said the program includes a new Empower money market share class for distribution by MDIs and diverse-led CDFIs, as well as an annual donation of 12.5% of revenue received from the management fees on Empower share class assets to support community development. The bank will also provide access to its resources, including training and education. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
Clubhouse has hired Android software developer Mopewa Ogundipe, signaling that the startup has begun development of a version of its app for the popular mobile operating system created by Google. Clubhouse has reached more than 10 million weekly active users, Clubhouse co-founders Paul Davison and Rohan Seth announced on Sunday.	Clubhouse, the rapidly growing social media audio app, has hired an Android software developer, signaling that the startup has begun development of a version of its app for the popular mobile operating system created by Google . "Today was my first day at @joinClubhouse," Mopewa Ogundipe tweeted on Monday. "If you know me, you probably know I have *opinions* about iOS only apps so I'm v. excited to be joining the team to bring the party to Android." Clubhouse launched in March 2020 , and since then, the company has quickly become one of the hottest consumer apps out of Silicon Valley . On Clubhouse, users can gather in audio-only virtual rooms, where they will often discuss topics about emerging tech, socialize over pop culture or listen to speakers like Elon Musk. Thus far, the app has only been available to iPhone users who receive an invite to the app. Despite the Apple exclusivity, the app has reached more than 10 million weekly active users, Clubhouse Co-founders Paul Davison and Rohan Seth announced on Sunday on the app. That's up from 2 million weekly active users on Jan. 24 . The company's development of an Android app comes after it secured a new funding round from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz in January. The funding round was for approximately $100 million and gave Clubhouse a $1 billion valuation, Axios reported . Ogundipe describes herself as an "Android developer since the Gingerbread days" in her Twitter bio. Her LinkedIn profile lists various roles developing Android-based software since 2014 at Instagram , Khan Academy and Medium.
Netflix commissioned a diversity study of its movies and TV shows that showed improvement in representation from 2018 to 2019, but gaps still remain. The company will spend $100 million over the next five years to fund organizations that help underrepresented communities find jobs in TV and film.	Netflix released a first-of-its-kind diversity study Friday to analyze the makeup of Netflix's on-screen talent, as well as the behind-the-camera creators, producers, writers and directors. The report shows that the company has made progress, but still has more work to do to close diversity gaps. The company says it's committing to an "inclusion lens" to its work, which co-CEO Ted Sarandos says means asking questions like, "Whose voice is missing? Is this portrayal authentic? Who is excluded?" The company also announced the creation of the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, which will invest $100 million over the next five years in organizations that help underrepresented communities train and find jobs in TV and film. Netflix also committed to releasing an update on this study every two years through 2026. "I think it's important that the content reflects the people that are watching it," Sarandos told CNBC's " Squawk Alley " in an interview Friday. "I think the way people can connect with content, with a great movie or a great series, is that they see something of themselves in that, either that it's very relatable, that it might look like them, or it reflects a life experience that they've also experienced." The study was conducted, at Netflix's request, by Stacy Smith, who has a PhD in communications and human development and is the founder and director of the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. The USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative produces regular reports on diversity in film and television. Smith's team examined all of the films and series Netflix commissioned between 2018 and 2019. Of the 22 inclusion indicators (such as racial identities, LGBTQ+ and disabilities), 19 showed improvement over the two-year period. Netflix's strengths in diversity are around women. The study found gender equality in leading roles across films and TV series. Smith also found that Netflix is outpacing the industry in hiring women and people of color as directors. Netflix was also found to exceed proportional representation of Black leads and main cast. But the report also found that other racial and ethnic groups were underrepresented relative to the U.S. population. LatinX characters were just 4% of leads, despite being 12% of the population, and just 3% of creators and producers were LatinX. The study also found that LGBTQ+ characters were rare: just 4% of leads in film and 1% in TV series. And while the study says that 27% of the U.S. population identifies as having a disability, fewer than 1% of series leads, and just 5% of series main cast were characters with disabilities. "Dr. Smith's years of research — including this new study — confirm that inclusion behind the camera exponentially increases inclusion in front of the camera, and that both depend on ensuring that the Netflix executives commissioning these stories are also diverse," Sarandos wrote in a blog post about the report. "Doing better means establishing even more opportunities for people from underrepresented communities to have their voices heard, and purposefully closing capacity and skill gaps with training programs where they are needed." Friday's news and the company's fund is the latest in a series of commitments to diversity. In January, the company released its first Inclusion Report about Netflix's employee ranks. And in June, Netflix made a $100 million commitment to support Black communities by putting 2% of its cash holdings into Black financial institutions serving low- and moderate-income communities. Netflix founder and co-CEO Reed Hastings has also made a personal commitment to diversity. In June, Hastings and his wife donated $120 million to historically Black colleges and universities.
The Golden Globes and last year's Emmys provide the upcoming Academy Awards telecast with a blueprint of do's and don'ts. The Globes ceremony was filled with technical hiccups and overshadowed by a number of scandals currently facing its host organization. The Academy Awards will take place Sunday, April 25. Nominees will be announced on March 15.	"Could this whole night have been an email?" co-host Tina Fey asked a small, socially distanced audience of first responders and essential workers during the opening monologue to the 78th annual Golden Globe Awards Sunday night. "Yes," she answered a moment later. The ceremony was filled with technical hiccups and overshadowed by a number of scandals currently facing its host organization, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Heading into the event, the HFPA was under fire for its lack of Black voters and over continued reports of internal corruption. That cloud never really cleared during the three-hour broadcast, as award winners oscillated between thanking the HFPA for their award and lambasting it for its lack of inclusivity. Ultimately, it seemed these newly minted Golden Globe honorees were torn between the joy of winning and the notion that their win might just be a little bit hollow. This year's Golden Globes, which was a hybrid of in-person presenters and at-home nominees due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic , provides the upcoming Academy Awards telecast with a blueprint of do's and don'ts. The producers prepping for the upcoming April 25 ceremony will also be able to retrace the steps taken by the Emmy Awards last September. The Emmys were the first Hollywood award show to broadcast during the pandemic. Here are five things the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences can learn from other pandemic award shows: It became glaringly clear early in Sunday's ceremony that the 78th Golden Globes were going to be riddled with technical difficulties. During the first acceptance speech, Daniel Kaluuya was clearly speaking via video, but viewers could not hear him. Producers briefly shut down his speech, with presenter Laura Dern apologizing and wishing Kaluuya congratulations. "You did me dirty, you doing me dirty, you doing me dirty," Kaluuya can be heard saying as Dern leaves the stage, his audio finally coming in. "Am I on? Is this on? Am I on?" Kaluuya won the award for best supporting actor in a motion picture for his work in "Judas and the Black Messiah." Similar technical mishaps occurred throughout the night, with Fey and co-host Amy Poehler occasionally talking over each other while hosting from opposite coasts and the production crew trying to play several winners off with loud music that the winners didn't seem to be able to hear. Additionally, sound and lighting quality varied greatly from nominee to nominee, with some having crisp and clear images while others were grainy and shot at odd angles. There was also the decision to end every segment before a commercial break with a series of video windows showcasing the nominees up for the next award. It seems that producers hoped for the nominees to chat with each other like they were on a private Zoom call. While some nominees played along, others waited patiently — and silently — for the camera to cut away. For the Emmy Awards, producers opted to ship out 130 cameras to nominees in 20 cities and 10 countries . Nominees were sent a ring light, a laptop, a boom mic and a camera as part of the package. This made the individual videos more uniform and ensured that each nominee had the proper equipment to appear on the broadcast. Winners gave their acceptance speeches and then were transferred over to a virtual press room to conduct quick press conferences with reporters. While the Emmys weren't completely free of technical glitches, any that occurred were small and unmemorable. In fact, the biggest challenge the Emmys faced was when, during a bit on stage, Jimmy Kimmel and Jennifer Aniston accidentally started a fire. Kimmel, as a joke, had doused the envelope with Lysol and set it on fire to poke fun at the lengths the production had gone to to ensure that everyone who participated was safe. However, Aniston was unable to put out the flames with a fire extinguisher at first, leading to a small blaze. Ultimately, she was able to temper the fire. Kimmel and Aniston remained level-headed about the incident, improving a bit while they snuffed out the fire and continued calmly with the rest of the show. Nobody "went home" with a Golden Globe trophy during Sunday's event, mainly because all of the nominees were at home. While the Emmys used this to its advantage by finding unique ways to deliver the awards to winners, the Globes opted to ship out the trophies at a later date. Having nominees waiting to see if the black box that had been delivered to their home would erupt with confetti and burst open with a golden prize inside was a clever and entertaining way to keep nominees and viewers at home locked in on the telecast. Social media was flooded with photos and videos of nominees watching as men and women in blow-up tuxedo hazmat suits stood outside their door with an Emmy Award only to walk away when another winner was named during the broadcast. Without the trophies, the Globes felt flat, with winners reciting their speeches to the camera without the thrill of hoisting their shiny prize. The Academy Awards is a much more serious occasion than the Emmys, so it's not likely that the production team will opt to have trophies burst out of boxes in a hail of confetti or via a costumed delivery person. Still, the ceremony could benefit from finding a way to get trophies into the hands of its winners. In hiring Fey and Poehler to host the Golden Globes, the HFPA got seasoned awards ceremony comedians, but also a hitch — Fey lives in New York and Poehler lives in California. As a compromise, the production decided to have Fey appear live from the Rainbow Room in New York City and Poehler from The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The idea was that this would allow both women to host without having to endure travel during the pandemic. It also expanded the list of presenters available to the broadcast. In truth, the Globes didn't have to be bicoastal. Instead of providing equipment to nominees, the HFPA opted to split its production, hiring two separate crews to do a job that, in the past, has been done by one. Some of the banter between Fey and Poehler seemed organic. But the attempt to match their backgrounds so it appeared like they were standing next to each other didn't always work. The result was a number of weird timing mishaps. "One could make allowances if it seemed like the Globes were attempting new or innovative things within the format," Daniel Fienberg wrote in his review of the event for The Hollywood Reporter . "But nothing in this show was appreciably more innovative than what the Emmys did five-plus months ago, and the Emmys nailed almost every challenge and avoided almost every disaster." In recent years, much of the criticism of awards shows has centered around the length of the telecasts. In some cases, shows have been able to keep pace, allowing winners ample time for their speeches and providing some skits or prerecorded sketches to break up the monotony. Sunday's Globes failed in this regard. Many of the comedic bits the show tried to include fell flat, seeming to drag on for much longer than they should. "Oh, you are taking so much time with this," Poehler seems to half-joke during a nearly four-minute skit between Maya Rudolph and Kenan Thompson, who play Beverly Jackfruit and Francois Jean-Rudy, winners of a fake award for Least Original Song. Yet, award winners were consistently pressed for time while delivering their speeches, with the production playing increasingly loud music to force them to wrap up. Only it seemed that the winners couldn't hear this musical cue. For years, Hollywood has been plagued by concerns about its diversity and inclusion initiatives . The Golden Globes is just the latest award show to be criticized for its lack of nonwhite nominees. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has worked to introduce major changes to its voting and recruitment rules but still struggles to cultivate a more diverse set of nominees. In 2016, the organization set a goal of doubling the number of diverse members by 2020 following outrage over a lack of Oscar nominees who were female or people of color. The Academy has made strides. It has added a historic number of new members that represent minorities. Still, last year, only two of the 20 actors and actresses nominated were people of color and no female directors were nominated. Of the nine films nominated for best picture, only the South Korean movie "Parasite" featured a predominantly nonwhite cast and only one, "Little Women," was centered around numerous female characters. The 2021 Oscar nominations are due out on March 15, so we will have to wait two weeks to see if the nominees are more inclusive this year. If the Academy takes any cues from the Golden Globes, the importance of diversity should certainly be one of them. The HFPA was pummeled with criticism ahead of Sunday's ceremony and throughout the broadcast from its hosts, presenters and honorees. Jane Fonda, who accepted the Cecil B. DeMille Award during the Golden Globes ceremony, used her speech to explain how stories can change people's perceptions of different cultures and that Hollywood has been afraid of its own story for too long. "There's a story we have been afraid to see and hear about ourselves and this industry," she said. "The story about which voices we respect and elevate and which we tune out. A story of who is offered a seat at the table and who is kept out of the room where decisions are made. Let's all of us, including all the groups that decide who gets hired and what gets made and who wins awards, let's all of us make an effort to expand that tent." Despite nominations for Black actors and filmmakers being sparse, winners were not in short supply. Kaluuya, John Boyega, Andra Day and the late Chadwick Boseman were all honored for their work during Sunday's ceremony. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. The 2021 Golden Globes aired on NBC.
Research shows Asian-owned businesses saw the biggest decline in working business owners through the end of 2020. San Francisco's Chinatown has been hard-hit as it relies heavily on tourism. The local chamber of commerce says 75% of storefronts in the ZIP code where Chinatown is located were nonoperational at some point in 2020. The Biden Administration recently announced changes to the Paycheck Protection Program to ensure smaller and minority-owned businesses can access aid.	Nancy Yu has been a staple in San Francisco's Chinatown for more than two decades. Her store, Asiastar Fantasy, sells souvenirs, gifts and cultural items like red envelopes for Lunar New Year. While she's weathered many challenges over the years, she's never seen anything quite like 2020. "Last year was a very difficult time — not just for us in Chinatown, but the whole city, the whole world," Yu said. Her sales are down 80% due to the pandemic . But for the last several months, Yu has been opening her store for several hours a day to be present for the community, even as business remains low. "We want to send a message to people and ultimately say 'Keep Chinatown open, we welcome you,'" she said. "I think it's important that we stay open. We want to give people and other merchants encouragement." The neighborhood has seen a downturn due to a lack of tourism not only in Chinatown, but the Bay Area at large. Also, more broadly, research from Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz shows Asian-owned businesses nationwide have been the most negatively impacted of all demographic groups by last year's pandemic. The number of working business owners fell by 20% from February to December, according to his study. The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce says the ZIP code that houses most of Chinatown saw 75% of its storefronts become nonoperational at some point last year. The same ZIP code also includes the Financial District, which has been similarly hard-hit due to people working from home. This compares with the city average, where 54% of all storefronts were nonoperational at some point in time in 2020. "Covid-19 had a huge impact on tourism, which represents a major portion of San Francisco's income — 25.8 million visitors come to San Francisco [annually]," said Rodney Fong, president and CEO of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. "It's painful when you see some of these legacy businesses close. They are pillars of our community." The latest Paycheck Protection Program data from the Small Business Administration through the end of February show Asian-owned businesses trailing other demographic groups in terms of the number of loans approved. More than 70,000 loans were made to Asian-owned businesses for a total of $3.9 billion in 2021. Filling out the demographic questions is voluntary and as a result, incomplete. Overall 2.1 million loans have been made for $156 billion in 2021, with more than $100 billion in aid remaining in the program, which ends March 31. Last week the Biden administration announced changes to the PPP to ensure smaller and minority-owned businesses were able to fairly access funding. There's currently a two-week window ongoing for businesses with 20 or fewer employees to exclusively apply for aid. In addition, there will be changes to how much funding the self-employed and sole proprietors can access, which is important as the administration projects 70% of such businesses are owned by women and minorities. In addition, there will be $1 billion set aside for sole proprietors in low and moderate-income areas. Other changes include allowing those with non-fraud-related prior felony arrests or convictions, those who are delinquent on federal student loans and legal U.S. residents who are not citizens, like green card holders, to be eligible for PPP aid. Minority-owned businesses are more likely to be non-employer firms and advocates say lenders may have been less incentivized to make smaller loans to these smaller businesses under the PPP as written last year. Smaller companies also don't always have the established banking connections or manpower to apply for aid, a divide exacerbated during the pandemic, the San Francisco Chamber's Fong said. "The pandemic has shown the digital divide in people who have access and have the skill set to apply for PPP, which is not an easy thing to do, and those that maybe got left out," he said, adding that continued changes to the PPP like those newly enacted by the administration will help to better reach more owners. "Giving everyone that equal access, equal opportunity, is important." When Yu applied for a PPP loan last year, she was initally turned away by a local bank, but eventually received one. She is now waiting on a second-draw loan. Separately, a local grant she received has helped with her rent. Beyond the pandemic's impacts on business, the Asian-American community at large is grappling with another painful threat — an uptick in violence and racism against the Asian population over the last year. Between March 19 and Dec. 31, Stop AAPI Hate, an organization tracking anti-Asian incidents, found more than 2,800 accounts of racism and discrimination targeting Asian Americans across the U.S., including more than 100 against the elderly. Yu said the threat weighs on her. "We want to let people know that we are here for peace, we are here for prosperity and for the American dream. We have the same dream. That's why we came to America," she said. Despite the challenges 2020 presented, Yu is moving ahead. She plans to open a second location in Chinatown in the year to come, selling boba tea. —CNBC's Betsy Spring contributed to this report.
John Rogers of Ariel Investments told CNBC companies must recognize disparities around retirement savings contributions. "When you look behind the surface you'll see that African Americans will often have much less saved," the firm's co-CEO and chief investment officer said.	John Rogers of Ariel Investments told CNBC on Wednesday that corporations can play a critical role in helping close the racial wealth gap in the United States. In an interview on "Closing Bell," the firm's co-CEO and chief investment officer pointed to retirement savings plans as one place to start addressing it. But even then, Rogers said there must be a recognition that disparities around 401(k) contributions exist, too. "One of the ways to get progress is for all major corporations and anchor institutions in our community to understand there is a problem, and that their African American employees, even though they might be at similar percentage comparability when it comes to joining the 401(k) plan, when you look behind the surface you'll see that African Americans will often have much less saved," said Rogers, who founded Ariel in 1983. Chicago-based Ariel — the first African American-led firm to have a family of mutual funds — recently released a survey conducted with Charles Schwab that looked at the wealth gap between Black and white Americans, as well as their exposure to the stock market. It found that while Black Americans now report similar ownership levels of 401(k) plans as white respondents, at 53% compared with 55%, respectively, differences in savings rates persist. According to the report, white Americans participating in 401(k) plans invest 26% more in their retirement accounts each month than Black counterparts, translating to a monthly difference of $291 versus $231. Rogers said there are a number of factors contributing to Black Americans accumulating less in retirement savings than white Americans. "We will be in the most conservative investment options, the most conservative funds. We're much more likely to take hardship loans, early withdrawals to help support expanded families," Rogers contended. Focusing on disparities in 401(k) plans is significant because retirement accounts made up the largest share of U.S. household wealth at 32.8%, according to an August 2020 report from the Census Bureau. It used data from the end of 2017 and excludes the top 1% of households. Home equity was second, accounting for almost 29% of household wealth, follow by stocks and mutual funds at 10.2%. "It's really a responsibility of these anchor institutions to put extra effort on really making sure their minority employees are comfortable in the investments within that 401(k) plan," Rogers said. "Maybe there should be more minority-owned options within the 401(k) plan that will get minority employees excited about it." According to the Federal Reserve's 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances , white families in the U.S. have a median wealth of $188,200 compared with a median wealth of $24,100 for Black families. That current landscape is the result of myriad inequities adding up throughout U.S. history, Rogers said, while noting the housing crisis and the coronavirus pandemic have more recently served to exacerbate the problem. 'The wealth gap has been growing larger and larger every year between the African American and the white America. We've been behind for a very, very long time," Rogers said. "Because of the way we came to this country, the historic racism and Jim Crow laws and things that really impacted us, the restrictive covenants that didn't allow us to buy housing in the fast-growing parts of communities, we were way behind the race when it came to wealth, and it continues to get worse." Rogers also was interviewed Wednesday for a CNBC PRO Talks. Subscribe to watch the full interview below and read about his stock picks here .
Chipotle is tying executive compensation to annual targets aimed at improving the company's internal diversity and sustainability. Investors have been pushing publicly traded companies to make more commitments to improve their environmental, social and corporate governance. Chipotle plans to publish its carbon emissions footprint by the end of the year.	Chipotle Mexican Grill said Thursday that executive compensation will now be linked to hitting targets tied to the company's environmental and diversity goals. The burrito chain is following in the footsteps of Starbucks and McDonald's , both of which recently  announced that performance for racial and gender diversity goals will impact executive compensation plans. Individual investors and large asset managers like BlackRock are increasingly picking stocks with strong environmental, social and corporate governance in mind, pushing companies to make changes to become a more attractive investment. "I think the increased focus on performance around ESG and investor feedback was definitely behind our decision to go public with this," said Laurie Schalow, who oversees sustainability and ESG reporting for Chipotle in her role as corporate affairs chief and food safety officer. Starting this year, 10% of Chipotle executives' annual incentives will be tied to their progress toward achieving company goals. "It's very important for us to be transparent and to be held accountable. We can say a lot of words, but we want to make sure that we have the actions to back it up," Schalow said. Those targets include increasing the pounds of organic, local or regeneratively grown or raised food from the previous year. Last year, Chipotle hit 31 million pounds of local produce under this umbrella, and it has set a goal of 37 million pounds by the end of 2021. The company plans to publish its carbon footprint, including all indirect emissions along its value chain, by the end of the year, faster than its prior expected publication date of 2025. Schalow said the company will announce new sustainability goals stemming from those learnings when the report is released. Chipotle is also seeking to maintain racial and gender pay equity and promote more women and people of color above the restaurant level. It has created a training academy with online courses that teach a wide range of skills, from conflict resolution to setting goals, with the aim of helping employees of all backgrounds climb the corporate ladder. The company employed nearly 88,000 people, as of Dec. 31. Shares of Chipotle have risen 91% in the last 12 months, giving it a market value of $39.6 billion.
Henrietta Fore said remote learning is needed in every country of the world. "Half of the world is not connected to the internet. And when you look globally at statistics, women tend to be less often connected than men," she told CNBC's "Finding Solutions."	LONDON — Henrietta Fore, the executive director of UNICEF, told CNBC that solving a "digital divide" is essential for addressing global equality. Fore, who took up her role at the U.N. agency in 2018, said remote learning is needed in every country of the world, whereby education is reimagined "so that every child has the chance to learn, even in a pandemic." "Half of the world is not connected to the internet. And when you look globally at statistics, women tend to be less often connected than men," she told CNBC's "Finding Solutions" on the sidelines of the Goals House January Dialogues event. "So, if we do not give digital skills to girls, to the poorest, to the most marginalized in every society, we cannot have an equal basis for the world," she added. Goals House, a collaboration between many of the world's most influential figures, focuses on using the 17 U.N. Sustainable Development Goals as a roadmap for a reset, following the Covid-19 crisis. Other participants in the show, which explores gender equality, include Britain's Princess Eugenie. The princess launched The Anti-Slavery Collective with Julia de Boinville in 2017 to help raise awareness of modern slavery, which includes forced labor, human trafficking and forced early marriage. A 2016 report, published by the International Labour Organization and the Walk Free Foundation in partnership with the International Organization for Migration, estimated that 40.3 million people were living in modern slavery around the world. It said 71% of those affected were women and girls. Eugenie told CNBC she had been moved to focus on the issues of modern slavery after a trip to India in 2011 where she met the Women's Interlink Foundation which helps trafficked women. "It sort of spurred us on to create The Anti-Slavery Collective which looks to raise awareness and convene people around modern slavery and how we can really effect change in that world," she said. Speaking before the birth of her son on Feb. 9, the princess told CNBC that she hopes that her child will also continue to make a difference in the world. "I think my child hopefully will be one of those people who will continue to see the world as a place that can be changed. I would love people to continue to have hope that we can make a difference," she said. Meanwhile, model, actress and activist Sabrina Dhowre Elba told CNBC at the event that she was inspired by her own mother to become a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador for the International Fund for Agricultural Development, supporting rural women and girls. "My mom comes from a rural community in Somalia, and I was born in Canada, but she was always speaking about the importance of agriculture in these communities, and how the majority of women in those communities work in informal markets as she once did," she said. Elba said the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change had impacted those informal markets, including the closure of transportation routes. She told CNBC that how women and young people in rural communities are perceived has also been part of the problem. "I think women are looked at as incapable in some ways of doing the work that their counterparts do, and that's changing as well, because as we all know ... we are very capable, and it's about investment and it's the systems around them that are broken as opposed to the women themselves," she said. The representation of women and girls and telling their stories has been the central focus of Glamour magazine for over 80 years. Speaking at the same virtual event, the editor-in-chief of U.S. Glamour, Samantha Barry, told CNBC, "I think it's important for lots of women across lots of different walks of lives to see themselves represented in beauty and fashion content, in sex and relationship content, in content that is joyous and celebrates them as much as it is about the fight for equality." "I know that at Glamour we're very conscious of that in the people that we include, and representation, we know from our audience, matters more than ever," she added. Barry said the crisis had been a "huge setback" for women and the conversations around achieving the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goal focused on gender equality were very important. "It shouldn't only be driven by women," she said. "It should be driven by the whole community, a global community, getting on board, understanding the difference that gender equality makes to the world around them, for their mothers and their daughters and their sisters and just the general world." — Don't miss more coverage of inequality and Finding Solutions next week, kicking off on March 8 with International Women's Day.
Employment statistics for women of color were not only more severe when the Covid-19 pandemic began, but are more sluggish in improving. For white workers, the unemployment rate fell to 5.6% in February. But for Black and Hispanic workers, reported jobless rates were 9.9% and 8.5%, respectively. But as stark as the race- and ethnicity-based disparities are, the recession's unequal impact is more pronounced in analysis that includes both race and gender. Employment for Black women is 9.7% lower than it was in February 2020. Employment for white men, white women, and Black men is down 5%, 5.4% and 5.9%, respectively.	Friday's employment report pointed to further signs of a recovery in the U.S. economy, with 379,000 net jobs added and the unemployment rate falling to 6.2%. But despite the encouraging top-line numbers , the job-market's 2020 swoon and its 2021 recovery have not fallen equally across the U.S. labor force. Employment data was worse for minority groups, particularly women of color, than for white workers during the early days of the Covid-19 recession. The recovery has been more sluggish for minority groups, too. The divergence in the job market's recovery was evident in Friday's jobs report, which showed a decline in the white unemployment rate and an increase in the Black unemployment rate. For white workers, the unemployment rate fell to 5.6% in February, below the national rate. But for Black and Hispanic workers, reported jobless rates were 9.9% and 8.5%, respectively, remaining above the U.S. figures as they have been throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. White unemployment peaked at 14.1% in April 2020. Black unemployment peaked at 16.7% in both April and May. Hispanic unemployment peaked at 18.9% in April. But as stark as the race- and ethnicity-based disparities are, the recession's unequal impact is more pronounced in analysis that includes race and gender. Black and Hispanic women, in particular, have suffered some of the steepest spikes in unemployment and largest drops in labor force participation rate since the pandemic began. Total employment for Black women is 9.7% lower than it was in February 2020, before Covid-19 hit the U.S., with that figure for Hispanic women close behind at 8.6% lower. Employment for white men, white women, and Black men is down 5%, 5.4% and 5.9%, respectively, since February 2020. Though explanations for this trend vary, some economists suggest occupational segregation — that is, prevalence of a demographic in a given industry — is a likely culprit. "Whoever was hit the hardest takes the longest to recover," said Kate Bahn, an economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a think tank founded by Democratic political consultant John Podesta. "Once we are long into the recovery, employment levels and income levels may not fully recover for years." "Women are slightly more represented in some sectors like leisure and hospitality and food service," Bahn added. "We've also lost health care jobs, particularly low wage health care jobs that are disproportionately held by women of color." Economists hope that President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package , expected to pass the Senate this weekend, will not only hasten the broad economic recovery but assist those who saw their jobs cut. The bill contains $1,400 stimulus checks, an extension of weekly unemployment payouts of $300 to September and $350 billion in aid to state to local governments. Janelle Jones, the first Black woman to be chief Labor economist, wrote last month that this trend is also apparent in the public sector, which saw steep layoffs at the state and local levels over the past 12 months. "Losses in local and state government and leisure and hospitality have disproportionate impacts on Black women's employment. Black women are nearly one in four public sector workers," Jones wrote in a blog post dated Feb. 9 . "Half a million Black women have left the labor market since January 2020." Breaking the February jobs report down by industry, a surge in hiring at restaurants and bars helped lead the broader hospitality sector up 355,000 jobs last month. Those gains help offset the losses it's accrued over the last 12 months. Leisure and hospitality as a whole is is down 3.5 million jobs, or 20%, versus February 2020. Government payrolls lost 86,000 workers last month as layoffs continued in public education While high unemployment rates tend to garner attention and are perhaps easier to understand, a significant drop in the number of women either working or seeking work can prove more insidious in the longer term. Labor force participation for Black women plunged from 63.9% in February 2020 to 59.5% in April 2020, the lowest rate since 1993. The February jobs report showed that figure had improved slightly since April to 59.7%. Historically, women who dropped out of the workforce during a recession to care for their kids often struggled to return, being unable to find a job in their prior role or draw the same wage. The Covid recession might end up even worse for women. Unlike prior economic downturns, the disease forced thousands of children out of school and back into the home , where the duties of childcare continue to more often fall on women. And especially on mothers in families that cannot afford childcare. Historically, Black women have fared better than Black men in the labor market, said Kristen Broady, a fellow in economics studies at the Brookings Institution and policy director of the think tank's Hamilton Project. Unemployment rates for Black women, who Broady said are more likely to have a college education, are typically lower than those for Black men. But the unique nature of the Covid recession and resulting childcare issues have disproportionately impacted Black women's ability to work. "In other recessions, children were still in schools," said Broady. "If you can't afford child care and are a single mom, you can't go to work. And that's more likely to affect black and Hispanic women."
Japan has seen a marked increase in female participation in the workforce — surpassing the U.S. and Europe in terms of percentage, according to Kathy Matsui, a former vice-chair and strategist at Goldman Sachs Japan. Matsui is widely recognized as the one who coined the term "womenomics," a key pillar of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic reforms aimed at helping Japan boost its economy by tapping on women. Still, there is a glass ceiling with regard to women occupying top leaderships positions in Japan,  says Matsui.	Japan has seen a marked increase in female participation in the workforce — surpassing the U.S. and Europe in terms of percentage — but there's still a glass ceiling for women in leadership roles, says Kathy Matsui, a former vice-chair and strategist at Goldman Sachs Japan. Matsui is widely recognized as the one who coined the term "womenomics" in 1999 , which became a key pillar of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic reforms aimed at helping Japan boost its economy by bringing women into the workforce. Japan has made significant progress on that front due to a tight labor market and an improving economy, Matsui said. " Since we broached the topic of womenomics 22 years ago, for instance, the percentage of Japanese women who can work (and) were actually working outside the home used to be one of the lowest in the G-7," said Matsui in an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Monday. But that trend has reversed. Before the coronavirus pandemic, the percentage of Japanese women working shot up close to 72% —close to the highest, according to Matsui. That's compared to only about 67% in the United States and 63% in the European Union, she said. "So the numbers are actually way up as a function of a tight job market and a growing economy," she noted. Still, there is a glass ceiling with regard to women occupying top leaderships positions in Japan,  according to Matsui. "But where that ceiling really affects Japan is that there's still a dearth of women in a leadership position," she said. "For instance, female manager ratio is still stuck at around 15%. And the percentage of female board directors still in the single digit territory — less than half of what we see elsewhere in the developed world." "So we still have a long way to go in terms of grooming women to positions of decision-making and authority," she pointed out. According to a Nikkei report last year , women occupied less than 8% of management positions in corporate Japan. This is far less than the goal set by the Japanese government which aimed to have women occupy 30% of management posts by 2020. While the government still has a role to play, in terms of making the environment and infrastructure easier for women to participate in the workforce, corporate Japan also needs to step up, said Matsui. "I think there's a lot of onus or responsibility on the employer side as well, to figure out how to not just nurture these women but motivate, encourage and give them opportunities that are on par with their male colleagues. So as to reach that goal of higher women in leadership roles," she added.
University Hospital CEO Dr. Shereef Elnahal told CNBC on Monday that more people in Newark, New Jersey, and nearby areas want the Covid vaccine. Initially, he said, about 40% of people were willing to get it. "Now that number is closer to 60%" in the communities his hospital serves, Elnahal said.	Dr. Shereef Elnahal , president and CEO of University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, told CNBC on Monday that a majority of people in the nearby community want to receive the Covid vaccine, a shift from earlier in the rollout. "There is a significant amount of hesitancy, especially in communities of color and urban communities like the one we serve here in Newark," the state's biggest city, Elnahal said on "Worldwide Exchange." "The good news, though, is that hesitancy is moving in the right direction." "We had only about 40% of the city of Newark and the surrounding region ready and willing to take the vaccine when it arrived. Now that number is closer to 60%," added Elnahal, a former New Jersey health commissioner under Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. Elnahal's comments come as the Covid vaccine rollout in the U.S. accelerates. On Saturday, a record 2.9 million doses were administered , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Overall, a total of more than 90 million Covid doses have been given. In all, 17.7% of the U.S. population of over 330 million people have gotten at least one dose, and 9.2% were fully vaccinated with both doses of either Pfizer 's or Moderna 's two-shot regime. Johnson & Johnson 's single-shot vaccine became the third one to receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Feb. 27. The CDC vaccine tracker numbers do not yet explicitly break out how many shots of J&J have been given, as it only started rolling out in the U.S. last week. While the vaccination pace has picked up in recent weeks and eligibility has widened, some health experts, such as former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb , have warned that the pool of Americans eager to receive the shot could dry up sooner than expected . "I think demand here ... is deep but not wide," Gottlieb, a Pfizer board member, told CNBC last month. "There's probably about, maybe, 100 million Americans that want this very badly. Beyond that, we're going to have to work on it." Shortly after the FDA cleared Pfizer's vaccine for emergency use, some hospital leaders speculated that hesitancy even among their workforces would fade over time as skeptical employees saw their colleagues receiving the shots. Indeed, the U.S. public's desire to be vaccinated against Covid has risen in recent months. According to a Pew Research Center poll from earlier this month, 69% plan to get a Covid vaccine or have already received it. That's an improvement from Pew's findings in November — a month before either Pfizer or Moderna formally got FDA clearance — that only 60% of Americans intended to be vaccinated. Polls have shown Black and Latino people to be more skeptical of the vaccines than the U.S. overall due to historic mistreatment in medicine . Disparities along racial lines in vaccine distribution also have been observed in the U.S. Elnahal said University Hospital — a teaching hospital for the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School — has done various outreach programs to try to build trust in Covid vaccines. "When we go through that door of trust and ultimately say, 'Hey, we're here with an initiative that will save your life potentially,' especially in a community that was hit so hard," Elnahal said, "we also emphasize that all three of these vaccines are 100% effective at preventing hospitalization and death [from Covid]." "That is huge, and frankly, these vaccines are better than so many others that have been on the market for a long time" for other diseases, he added. Disclosure: Scott Gottlieb is a CNBC contributor and is a member of the boards of Pfizer, genetic testing start-up  Tempus, health-care tech company Aetion and biotech company Illumina . He also serves as co-chair of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings ' and Royal Caribbean 's "Healthy Sail Panel."
Goldman Sachs is pledging $10 billion over 10 years to advance racial equity and economic opportunity for Black women. The new initiative is called "One Million Black Women." The firm noted that reducing the earnings gap for Black women could create up to 1.7 million jobs and add as much as $450 billion to U.S. GDP annually.	Goldman Sachs said Wednesday it will commit $10 billion over the next decade toward advancing racial equity and economic opportunity for Black women. The new initiative — called "One Million Black Women" — will focus on areas such as access to capital, job creation, financial health and workforce advancement. Goldman said the effort is "the largest announcement of its kind in size and scope." Goldman is partnering with Black women-led organizations to better understand the barriers Black women face. The bank will also invest $100 million in philanthropic capital over the next 10 years. The targeted funding will take the form of direct investing, as well as grants. The firm said initial investments are underway. The program's goal is to positively impact the lives of at least one million Black women by 2030, and its advisory council includes former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Goldman's announcement comes as employees, shareholders and society call on corporate America to do more against systemic racism. A slew of companies have announced new diversity and inclusion measures, but it's still unclear whether these initiatives translate into real progress. In conjunction with its funding announcement, Goldman released a report called "Black Womenomics," seeking to quantify the gender and racial biases that Black women have faced and continue to face. Like countless studies before, the findings show racial inequality is not just a social issue, but an economic one as well. The research found that Black women are paid 35% less than white men. Reducing this gap could create between 1.2 million and 1.7 million jobs in the U.S. and increase GDP by as much as $450 billion annually. Progress in closing the wage gap has stalled. The wage gap between Black and white women stands at 15%, up from 5% in the early 1980s. Differences were attributed back then to education, occupations and industries. While these factors are still relevant, harder-to-measure barriers such as differences in career opportunities play a larger part. "Largely because of lower earnings and limited access to capital, Black Americans are much less likely to own high-return assets than white individuals, including homes, stocks, and especially their own businesses," the report stated, finding that the median Black household owns almost 90% less wealth than the median white household. The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated the challenges Black women face. February jobs data showed a 5.9% unemployment rate for women overall, while the figure for Black women stood at 8.9%.
Nike has laid out a five-year roadmap to creating a more diverse and inclusive workforce. For the first time, Nike will tie its executive compensation to the company making progress in deepening diversity and inclusion throughout its workforce. Nike has faced its share of criticism in recent years for how it treats both women and employees of color. "We're proud of the successes we've seen, but we know the work is still just beginning," CEO John Donahoe said.	Nike has laid out a five-year roadmap to creating a more diverse and inclusive workforce, the company announced Thursday, as corporate America is increasingly being held accountable for their values and the actions that come with them. For the first time, Nike said, it will also be tying its executive compensation to the company making progress in deepening diversity and inclusion throughout its workforce, protecting the planet, and advancing ethical manufacturing. It didn't offer further details but said compensation would be tied to the company hitting its 2025 goals. "We're proud of the successes we've seen, but we know the work is still just beginning," President and Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe said in a letter addressing the five-year targets. "We are also redefining what responsible leadership looks like." In outlining the progress Nike made in 2020, the sneaker maker said it has increased representation of women globally across its business to 49.5%, from 48% in 2015. Representation of racial and ethnic minorities, meantime, at the vice president level in the United States increased to 29% last year, from 15.9% in 2015. Nike also highlighted the fact that its 2020 intern class was its most diverse ever, with 55% of its 310 interns being women, and 49% representing racial and ethnic minorities. By 2025, Nike said, it aims to achieve 50% representation of women in its global corporate workforce (which doesn't include retail store and warehouse workers), and 45% representation of women in leadership positions (VP level and above). It's targeting 35% representation of racial and ethnic minorities in its U.S. workforce by then, too. Nike also said it will invest $125 million over the next five years to support businesses that work to "level the playing field" and address racial inequalities. Last year, following the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis, Nike was one of a number of corporations that got behind a social justice movement and pledged to serve communities with a more diverse workforce. In June, it announced a $140 million commitment on behalf of the Nike and Jordan brands, and former NBA star Michael Jordan, to support businesses that help educate and promote Black Americans. "Our brand would not be what it is today without the powerful contributions of Black athletes and Black culture," Donahoe said in the letter. Nike has faced its share of criticism in recent years, though, for how it treats both women and employees of color. In late July 2018, it announced salary bumps for more than 7,000 workers and pledged to change and how it was awarding annual bonuses to its global staff, in an attempt to address concerns about pay equity and corporate culture. A year later, it started revising terms in new contracts to support athletes during pregnancy, after it was criticized for slashing pay of some female stars with children. Nike said its 2020 pay-equity data revealed that for every $1 earned by men globally, women earned $1. And for every $1 earned by white employees in the U.S., racial and ethnic minority employees earned $1 as well, it said. By 2025, Nike is pledging to maintain 100% pay equity across all employee levels, on an annualized basis. Read the full impact report from Nike here.

If Hollywood were to address racial inequities in the film and TV industry, annual revenue could rise by 7%, or about $10 billlion, according to the findings of a new study from McKinsey. The consulting firm's research found that Black-led stories are underfunded and undervalued. The management ranks of the film and TV industry are disproportionately white.	If Hollywood were to address racial inequities in the film and TV industry, annual revenue could rise by 7%, or about $10 billlion, according to the findings of a new study from McKinsey. The consulting firm's research found that Black-led stories are underfunded and undervalued. "A complex, interdependent value chain filled with dozens of hidden barriers and other pain points reinforces the racial status quo in the industry. Based on our research, we catalogued close to 40 specific pain points that Black talent regularly encounters as they attempt to build their careers," the authors of the report wrote. Franklin Leonard, the CEO and founder of The Blacklist, which aims to democratize writers' access to the entertainment industry, and a former McKinsey employee, prompted the consulting giant to undergo this study last June. "I reached out to some of my former colleagues and said that if you're interested in studying racial inequity, one place that you can do that is Hollywood," Leonard said. "Especially because not only does that economic inequity exist within our industry, but we export and amplify stories around the world, that also then has material effects of the lives of Black people and people around the world." The management ranks of the film and TV industry are disproportionately white. Ninety-two percent of all film executives are white, the report said. McKinsey noted that that's more than any other industry, including finance and energy. The TV industry is slightly more diverse than consumer goods, finance and transport/travel, at 87% white, according to the report. And while the U.S. population is roughly 13.5% Black, the report finds that 6% of Hollywood film's writers, directors and producers are Black, while 8% have at least one Black producer. McKinsey said there are key barriers to entry, including the fact that entry-level entertainment jobs often offer low or no pay. The research underscores that industry jobs are often shared among small, overwhelmingly white elite networks. Another challenge is bias — both unconscious and overt. "We have extraordinarily talented Black community in Hollywood and they're doing extraordinary work," Leonard said. "One has to wonder what they'd be capable of and what Hollywood would be capable of if we actually remove those obstacles and allowed everybody to participate on a level commensurate with their ability, and frankly commensurate with their ability to deliver a return on the investment." Leonard said he was "most shocked" by numbers regarding return on investment. "Black content, despite being underfunded, under-supported, under-distributed, still delivers a better ROI by about 10%," he said. To help level the field, the study recommends that studios embrace transparency and accountability about their own ranks, and expand recruiting to state schools and historically Black colleges and universities. That could be accomplished with the help of a third-party organization. Leonard noted that the potential $10 billion windfall that could be derived from diversity efforts is specifically tied to underrepresentation of Black talent and executives. The total opportunity is significantly larger than that if other underrepresented minorities are added as well.
The Senate confirmed Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M., as President Joe Biden's secretary of the Department of the Interior. The vote makes the second-term Democrat the first Native American to rise to Cabinet secretary in U.S. history. Haaland's confirmation fills one of the few remaining vacancies in Biden's Cabinet, nearly two months after he was sworn in.	The Senate on Monday voted to confirm Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M., as President Joe Biden 's secretary of the Department of the Interior, making the second-term Democrat the first Native American Cabinet secretary in U.S. history. The vote was 51-40, with four Republicans joining Democrats in favor. Haaland, an enrolled member of the Laguna Pueblo, earned bipartisan support to run the Interior department, which has a staff of 70,000 employees and is charged with overseeing the country's natural resources. The agency manages nearly 500 million acres of land , or one-fifth of the surface area of the United States. Haaland's confirmation fills one of the few remaining vacancies in Biden's Cabinet, nearly two months after he was sworn in. With most of the major posts now occupied, the outstanding positions include United States trade representative, Labor secretary, and Health and Human Services secretary. "We've now made history twice in the last few minutes," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said after the vote, noting that Haaland was the first Native American Interior secretary as well as the first Native American Cabinet secretary. The confirmation marks a victory for progressives who championed Haaland's nomination, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Haaland, a supporter of the Green New Deal, was one of the co-chairs of Warren's 2020 campaign for president. Republicans sought to wield Haaland's progressive stances against her during her confirmation hearings last month. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., pressed Haaland on her support for the Green New Deal and the declining number of jobs available in the fossil fuel industry. "I believe there are millions of jobs in a clean energy future," Haaland responded, in line with past statements from Biden. "If we can all work together I think we can do it all. I think we can protect our public lands and create jobs." Asked about her opposition to fracking on public lands, Haaland responded that if confirmed she would be supporting Biden's agenda, not necessarily her own. "President Biden does not support a ban on fracking, is my understanding," she said. During the hearing, Haaland emphasized her bipartisan credentials. In her first year in Congress, Haaland introduced more bills with a co-sponsor from another party than any other House freshman, according to GovTrack , which also rates her the 10th most politically left member of Congress. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted earlier in March to advance Haaland's nomination by a vote of 11-9, with Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, joining 10 Democrats in favor of her confirmation. In a somewhat unusual maneuver, Haaland also touted the support of Rep. Don Young, another Alaska Republican, who introduced her to the committee. "I have had her reach across the aisle to talk to me about Alaska. She's bipartisan," Young told lawmakers. Murkowski, though she voted to advance Haaland's nomination, was one of the apparent skeptics on the committee. "I am going to place my trust in Representative Haaland and her team despite some very real misgivings," Murkowski said. The four Republicans to vote in favor of Haaland's confirmation on Monday were Murkowski, Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. Sen. Joe Manchin, the influential and closely watched moderate Democrat from West Virginia, also lent his approval. Manchin cited Young's endorsement and said it was "long past time to give a Native American woman a seat on the Cabinet table." Haaland pledged at the hearing to work on repairing the U.S. federal government's relationship with Native American tribes if confirmed. She pointed to her own story as an inspiration. "If an Indigenous woman from humble beginnings can be confirmed as secretary of the Interior, our country holds promise for everyone," she said. Haaland is one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress, alongside fellow Democrat Sharice Davids of Kansas, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation.
The "United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development" has been launched in 2021 to help expand scientific knowledge and address the issues impacting the ocean. Peter Thomson, the U.N. secretary-general's special envoy for the ocean, told CNBC: "We've got 10 years where we're really mobilizing all around the world."	LONDON — Peter Thomson, the U.N. secretary-general's special envoy for the ocean, told CNBC that "there can be no healthy planet without a healthy ocean" as the organization launches a new 10-year project. Thomson said the "United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development" has been launched in 2021 to help expand scientific knowledge and address the issues impacting the ocean, which covers 70% of the planet's surface. "We only know maybe 10% of the ocean in terms of its biome, in terms of its makeup, in terms of its sea floor, for example," he told CNBC's "Finding Solutions — Sustainability" on the sidelines of the Goals House January Dialogues event. "We've got 10 years where we're really mobilizing all around the world, academic institutions and businesses and governments, all getting behind this ocean decade so that we will have the science that we need for the ocean we want by the time we get to 2030," he added. Goals House is a collaboration between many of the world's most influential leaders and organizations, focusing on achieving the 17 U.N. Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, as a roadmap for a reset following the Covid-19 crisis. Film writer and director Richard Curtis, another participant at the event, told CNBC that he felt "in the mind of the public there is a real need for big and dramatic change," and that business was also understanding its role in sustainability. "I do feel that business is really realizing its central responsibility in changing the world and not just leaving it to, as it were, charity, philanthropy and governments. Business is going to be the biggest thing that delivers the biggest change," he said. Curtis, who is also the co-founder of non-profit Project Everyone, also sensed a commitment and pressure from young people, including his own children, to make their own positive changes to how they travel, invest and spend their money, and which companies they choose to work for. He remains optimistic that "we can get a lot done" ahead of the 2030 U.N. goals deadline. "Huge progress was made on the Millennium Development Goals between 2010-2015. So, I'm hoping that, as it were, that mechanism of them being present, being integrated, and then suddenly being a strong deadline, will be an inspiring one for companies, governments and individuals," he said. Speaking at the same virtual event, Anne Finucane, vice chairman of Bank of America and chairman of the board at Bank of America Europe, also told CNBC that a focus on ESG — environmental, social and corporate governance — seems to have been "front and center during the pandemic" for many businesses. Bank of America began its own commitments around climate change in 2007, with the aim of financing $20 billion of green activity over 10 years. Within three or four years it had already achieved that target. The bank also recently made a $300 billion commitment to the environment aligned with the targets of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Finucane said President Joe Biden's decision to re-join the Paris Agreement, as well as appoint former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry as special presidential envoy for climate and Gina McCarthy as White House national climate advisor, has also led to further movement on climate change and sustainability. "These are forces of nature. They are already calling and expecting real activity," she said. Meanwhile, former F1 world champion and sustainability entrepreneur, Nico Rosberg, told CNBC at the event that he was also "putting a lot of hope in the Biden administration" to make the U.S. a leader in sustainability. An investor in smart mobility, he said the change of U.S. administration was a "huge opportunity and driving force" to further ramp up efforts for sustainability. Rosberg said sport also needs to come on board. He has recently founded a new racing team, Rosberg X Racing, to take part in Extreme E — a global off-road electric car racing series which aims to "minimize environmental impact, but maximize awareness, racing in places that have already been damaged or affected by climate change." "I want to show how a sports team, and any sports team not just a racing team even a soccer team, can put this greater purpose at their core," he said.  
Actor and entrepreneur Tracee Ellis Ross launched beauty line Pattern in 2019 that caters to the needs of Black women, an often underrepresented market in the cosmetics industry. Black consumers possess roughly $1.2 trillion in spending power, making them an important market for brands looking for growth. Ellis Ross told CNBC's Inclusion in Action forum that promoting diversity is more than just putting diverse executives "on mastheads."	For decades, companies creating haircare products for Black women — or buying into the market opportunity as Unilever did in its acquisition of Sundial Brands — have been stories told through numbers that justify catering to a minority consumer segment routinely pushed aside by the expansive, multi-billion-dollar beauty industry. The numbers are evident: according to Nielsen , Black consumers spent $473 million on haircare and $465 million on skincare products in 2018. But for actor and entrepreneur Tracee Ellis Ross, who launched her own beauty line catering to the needs of Black women in 2019, the numbers miss the mark. "I don't think that number even cracks the surface. Unfortunately, our industry and the world still uses numbers as a way to qualify and quantify our worth, and we are so much more expansive than that," Ellis Ross told CNBC's Inclusion in Action forum Thursday. Ellis Ross, a star on the hit show "Black-ish" who has long spoken out against the lack of diversity in Hollywood, teamed up with Ulta Beauty in 2019 to launch Pattern, a beauty line that caters to the needs of Black women. In recent years, the cosmetics giant, which also tapped Ellis Ross to serve as a diversity and inclusion adviser, announced plans to double Black-owned brands on store shelves by the end of 2021 and devote $25 million toward reaching underrepresented customers. Ellis Ross said that starting a brand that celebrated Black women was her "life's work," as she recalled her experience searching for beauty products at stores growing up. "Our little shelf space was at the back in a dark corner of the store and it was the same product from when I was a child to when I was an adult." A new generation of Black entrepreneurs is changing the beauty landscape , with brands including The Lip Bar, CurlMix and Curls growing sales and raising capital to expand their businesses. For Ellis Ross, building Pattern was a 12-year process from the moment she made her first brand pitch and it evolved over 75 different products and many experiments. "Long before I was on social media, I was walking through this journey with my hair. And I went from my own personal discovery to realizing that I was not alone. That there were so many people in this curly, coily and tight textured community that didn't have products that really met them where their hair was," she told CNBC. The beauty industry is an example of the opportunities to break down a systemic misunderstanding of the barriers to economic opportunity. "I feel that those are conversations that I think are getting better and easier, but I don't think one needs to explain why you need to have products for your hair. I think it's a given," Ellis Ross said. "The validity of my needs does not need to be justified," she added. Ellis Ross said the number of years it took to develop her brand speak to the long road ahead for the broader societal goals related to diversity. While there are signs of improvement in opening up more opportunities to minorities, companies need to communicate more, and "go beyond just D&I executives and mast heads." "This isn't a retail issue, this isn't an industry issue," Ellis Ross said. "This is a societal issue that we are all working through and have been for quite some time. ... To really look at not checking boxes, but where the systemic oppression actually meets the road. ... I think the more that we feel siloed off and think that our experience is so unique, we can't help each other move through and find solutions."
The Marshall Plan for Moms is calling for mothers to receive basic income payments, as well as affordable child care and paid family leave. Founded by Reshma Saujani, who created Girls Who Code, it calls upon the Biden administration to help support mothers in their unseen, and unpaid labors.	Reshma Saujani created Girls Who Code to crack the gender gap in technology. Now, she has committed to another major gender gap in need of a societal fix: parental labor. The Covid-19 pandemic led to a sharp reversal in gains that women made in the labor force over decades. If there is a silver lining, it also has shined a light on the work women have always done as mothers, but which the economy did not value. Saujani says it's time for a reckoning when it comes to placing the right economic value on motherhood. "Today we find ourselves as nannies, tech support, doing the cooking and cleaning, all the while trying to maintain full-time jobs and we are done because we are getting crushed. So, we need a 360-plan, a Marshall Plan for Moms, to get us back to work," Saujani told CNBC at its Inclusion in Action event on Thursday. The public policy components that need to be made permanent include basic income payments to mothers — an idea partially reflected in the Child Tax Credit included in the most recent stimulus legislation — as well as affordable child care, paid parental leave, and retraining of mothers who have lost their jobs, "jobs that are simply not coming back," Saujani said. She said the Child Tax Credit included in the stimulus plan should only be a downpayment on permanent policy options favored by the Marshall Plans for Moms. The Marshall Plan for Moms came about as a response to the high number of mothers dropping from the workforce over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic. According to Center for American Progress , women have lost a net of 5.4 million jobs during the recession — it has been dubbed a 'shecession ' — which is nearly 1 million more job losses than men. With having to accommodate remote-learning and having their kids home full-time, parents have had an increase in household responsibilities, most of which fall upon mothers. Research has shown that for every three mothers that leave the workforce, only one father leaves. Saujani wants mothers to demand appreciation and value for their hours of unpaid labor from both the corporate world and the government. The labor market losses experienced by working women have been referred to by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as a national emergency. Raujani said her idea for a $2,400 monthly direct payment was based on the Covid stimulus payment, but she said the public policy goal is much broader. "What we want is for President Biden to put together a task force to look at the economic recovery of mothers and to figure out what we [mothers] need to get back to work." Biden's platform as a presidential candidate included caregiving as a critical component of building a better national infrastructure. "We're not taking it anymore," Saujani said. "We have an opportunity again to build it back better and to ask for all of it. Ask for basic payments, demand paid leave, demand affordable child care, demand retraining, ensure that when we come back to companies, that we have flexibility and remote opportunities, that we don't have the motherhood penalty, that we have more on-ramps for mothers. We have plenty of off-ramps, but not a lot of on-ramps." — By Gabriella Boresi, CNBC intern
Ariel Investments' co-CEO Mellody Hobson said companies must commit to collecting and publishing diversity data. Hobson believes that greater diversity in hiring practices is a step in the right direction, but that attention needs to be focused on other areas as well, including diversity in supply chain. In February the firm announced Ariel Alternatives, which is focused on scaling sustainable, minority-owned businesses with annual revenue between $100 million and $1 billion.	As more companies announce diversity and inclusion measures, Ariel Investments' co-CEO Mellody Hobson believes there's a simple way to hold corporations accountable: math. "Math has no opinion — have the math. The only way you can do that is commit to having an annual review of these issues to see where you're gaining ground, where you're losing ground," she told CNBC's Sharon Epperson as part of the network's Inclusion in Action forum. "Measuring, and then having the wherewithal to publish those numbers I think holds everyone accountable," she said, before adding that tying compensation to diversity metrics could prompt the swiftest changes. The lack of diversity across the highest ranks of corporate America is certainly not new, but last year, the issue came into the limelight amid protests for racial justice. Additionally, minority workers were hit hardest by the pandemic and subsequent economic slowdown. As the economy recovers, unemployment rates among Black people and Latinos are significantly higher than for white Americans. "When thinking about the recovery, the hiring that companies will do, having a focus on inclusionary hiring practices, will make a huge difference," said Hobson, who sits on the boards of JPMorgan Chase and Starbucks. Hobson noted that policies designed to promote growth and equity across hiring practices — including at the board level — is a step in the direction, but not enough. She focuses on what she calls the three "P"s — people, purchasing and philanthropy. It's the purchasing category that Ariel believes needs more attention. This encompasses all areas of a company's spending power and supply chain. "We think that is another area where you can start to move the needle on equality in corporate America," Hobson said. In February the firm announced Ariel Alternatives, which is focused on scaling sustainable, minority-owned businesses. Hobson said the initiative will focus on joining capital and customers in a way that she believes has never been done before. She noted that much of the conversation around minority-owned businesses centers on access to capital, while the customer side of things, which is just as important, is overlooked. "If you have customers, you can get capital, and I think that has sometimes been lost in translation," she said. Ultimately, the goal is for these companies to become tier one suppliers for Fortune 500 companies. The initiative will target middle-market businesses with revenues between $100 million and $1 billion.
The economic recession caused by the Covid-19 pandemic pushed 75 million more people in India into poverty last year, an analysis by Pew Research Center showed. That's compared with the level it would have been without the outbreak, said the research firm. That number for India accounts for nearly 60% of the global increase in poverty in 2020, the analysis showed.	Around 75 million more people in India fell into poverty last year because of the pandemic-induced economic recession, compared with what it would have been without the outbreak, an analysis by Pew Research Center showed on Thursday. That number for India accounts for nearly 60% of the global increase in poverty in 2020, the analysis showed. It defined the poor as people who live on $2 or less daily. India has experienced one of the largest Covid-19 outbreaks globally. As of Friday, the country has reported a total of 11.51 million infections — trailing only the U.S. and Brazil — and over 159,300 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The International Monetary Fund forecast the Indian economy to shrink by 8% in the fiscal year ending this month, before growing by 11.5% in the next fiscal year starting April. The increase in poverty in India "claws back several years of progress on this front," Rakesh Kochhar, senior researcher at Pew Research Center, wrote in a report. From 2011 to 2019, the number of poor people in India was estimated to have dropped from 340 million to 78 million, he said in the report. That number would have fallen further to 59 million last year without the pandemic, but it is instead projected to rise to 134 million, the analysis showed. Growth in the country's middle class also took a hit. Those in the middle-income tier, defined as $10.01 to $20 a day, in India grew from 29 million to 87 million between 2011 and 2019 — and is expected to fall to 66 million in 2020 because of the Covid recession, said Kochhar. Like India, China has a large population of around 1.4 billion people. But the pandemic's effect on poverty was much smaller in China, according to Pew Research Center. China's economy expanded by 2.3% last year and is expected to grow by 8.1% this year, according to the latest IMF forecast. It was the only major economy to grow in 2020 — and that has helped poverty levels to remain "virtually unchanged," said Kochhar. The analysis on India and China accompanied Pew Research Center's report on the how the Covid-19 outbreak affected income levels around the world. Globally, an additional 131 million people became poor because of the global recession last year, compared with what it would have been if the pandemic didn't happen, the research firm said. "Given that India and China also account for more than a third of the global population, with about 1.4 billion people each, the course of the pandemic in these two countries — and how each recovers — will have a substantial effect on changes in the distribution of income at the global level," it said.
President Biden urged Congress to "swiftly pass" hate crime legislation to address the rise in discrimination and violence against Asian Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act aims to increase oversight at the Justice Department of coronavirus-related hate crimes, among other provisions.	President Joe Biden on Friday urged Congress to "swiftly pass" hate crime legislation to address the rise in discrimination and violence against Asian Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic . The Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act aims to increase Justice Department oversight of coronavirus-related hate crimes, provide support for state and local law enforcement agencies, and make hate crime information more accessible to Asian American communities. The move comes days after a shooting spree in Georgia that killed eight people, including six Asian women. The president and Vice President Kamala Harris are set to meet with Asian American leaders in Atlanta on Friday. "While we do not yet know motive, as I said last week, we condemn in the strongest possible terms the ongoing crisis of gender-based and anti-Asian violence that has long plagued our nation," Biden said in a statement. The endorsement also comes a day after a congressional hearing on violence against Asian Americans, the first in 34 years. Biden and several lawmakers and activists at the Thursday hearing pressed Congress to pass hate crime legislation introduced by Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., and Sen. Mazie K. Hirono, D-Hawaii, earlier this month. A study by advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate released Tuesday recorded 3,795 reports of hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders between March 19, 2020, and Feb. 28, 2021. The incidents include verbal slurs, physical attacks, workplace discrimination and online harassment, among other forms of prejudice. Many of the incidents were reported retroactively from 2020. The group emphasizes that the tally represents just a fraction of the number of hate incidents experienced by Asian Americans across the country. Some political leaders and advocates during the congressional hearing noted that hate crime legislation does not necessarily address all forms of hate experienced by Asian Americans. At a news conference in Atlanta on Thursday morning, Georgia state Rep. Bee Nguyen said: "Hate crime laws are not preventative. They are used in the aftermath as a prosecutorial tool." Prosecuting hate crimes requires law enforcement to find proof that incidents are racially motivated. "While many of the recent anti-Asian incidents may not meet legal definition of a hate crime, these attacks nonetheless create an unacceptable environment of fear and terror in Asian American communities," Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., said during the House hearing.
Kamala Harris may not be the president, but for those on the front lines of the battle to see a woman behind the Resolute desk, her ascendancy to the No.2 spot is an undeniable victory to build upon. "That is a huge milestone to cross over," said Stephanie Schriock, president of political action committee Emily's List, which has been on the front lines of that battle since 1985. The rest of the world has had less trouble producing female top political leaders and the structure of American government has a lot to do with it. The presidency is an especially masculinized office. It continues to give power and value to masculine traits, said Kelly Dittmar, associate professor of political science at Rutgers University.	Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote on Democrats' $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill that became the law of the land last week, marking another high-profile moment for the first female vice president in U.S. history. This week Harris, who is of Indian descent, is at the center of the administration's efforts to confront growing anti-Asian violence. Harris may not be the president, but for those on the front lines of the battle to see a woman behind the resolute desk, her ascendancy to the No.2 spot is an undeniable victory to build on. "That is a huge milestone to cross over," said Stephanie Schriock, president of political action committee Emily's List, which has been on the front lines of that battle since 1985. "She will be in the room where the big decisions are being made, where the agenda is being set, with a perspective that has never been there before." Beyond being the first female vice president, Harris brings the perspective of being the first Black woman and first Asian American woman to hold the office. Her multi-racial background made her a compelling choice for then President-elect Joe Biden as he sought a running mate who could lock in the Democratic voter coalition he needed to win. But Harris had higher ambitions initially. She was one of six Democratic women who ran for president in 2020, an historical feat in itself in a political system that has been hostile to women candidates since its inception. "In 2020 there were six women running, that was a really positive change for this process," said Schriock. "There's usually only one, and that's happened only a couple of times in our history." Harris' office did not respond to a request for comment. Efforts to get a woman elected to the highest office in the land stretch back well over a century. Victoria Claflin Woodhull became the first woman to run for the office in 1872, as the candidate of the Equal Rights Party. Dozens of women tried to gain a foothold in the following years, and they are listed here . The most significant milestone comes a full century later when Rep. Shirley Chisholm became the first Black woman to run for the Democratic nomination and the first woman to win votes at the Democratic National Convention. "Shirley Chisolm was really important moment for women in this country," said Schriock, even if her candidacy was considered mostly symbolic at the time. And then Hillary Clinton changed the game in dramatic fashion. The former first lady and New York senator brought real world experience and gravitas to her campaigns for president in 2008 and 2016. In her second campaign, the former secretary of State became the first woman to win a major party nomination and seemed poised to win it all. "Hillary Clinton was perceived as not only viable but as the front-runner," said said Kelly Dittmar, associate professor of political science at Rutgers University. Her electoral loss to Republican Donald Trump was a major blow to her legions of supporters, but Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million, proving that Americans were finally willing to put their trust in a female leader. That election also laid bare the most egregious stereotypes that have held women back from the nation's top job. "One of the bigger gender stories in 2016, was the doubling down on a traditional and toxic form of masculinity that Donald Trump" relied on to win the election, Dittmar added. Trump aggressively attacked his rivals, used offensive language and racial and gender stereotypes to inflame voters' fears and insecurities. His extreme tactics helped him win the Republican nomination and pick up enough votes in three traditionally blue states to win an electoral college victory over Clinton. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, who ran for the Republican nomination during the 2016 primary, experienced Trump's sexism first-hand when he famously made comments disparaging her appearance. Fiorina, who was the first female to run a fortune 500 company, said she was accustomed to being the only woman in the room and getting comments about her looks. But she put the awkward shoe on the other foot: "Donald Trump's comments about my face and all the rest of it, I think it was an example of some men not really knowing quite how to deal with" female competitors, she said in an interview. She addressed his remarks from the debate stage where she could communicate with her audience unfiltered. "What I wanted to convey was every woman in America understands that when a man comments on your appearance, when the subject is your competence or your capability, it's not appropriate, whether it's a positive comment or a negative comment," she said. "Your opinion of my appearance is not only inappropriate, it's irrelevant." Trump wasn't the only one engaging in sexist behavior during that chaotic election season. The press paid more attention to candidate Clinton's clothing, hair and demeanor than Trump's, Dittmar said. The media also gave Trump more coverage. A report from The Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center found that Trump received about 15% more coverage than Clinton. But voter attitudes remain the most critical stumbling block in a woman's path to the presidency: There's this idea that the president "should be someone we want to have a beer with, and that's usually a man," said Nadra Kareem Nittle, a veteran journalist covering politics and public policy. The rest of the world has had less trouble producing top political leaders. Dittmar explained that the structure of American government has a lot to do with it. Most of the female leaders from Britain to Pakistan have been prime ministers who are selected by their party, not direct elections. In America, it's different. "We have very candidate-centered electoral system that amplifies the stereotypical challenges. The presidency is an especially masculinized office. It continues to give power and value to masculine traits." The president is after all the Commander-in-chief, "so, yes, we associate those roles with a man," said Fiorina. Clinton's historic run and devastating loss, however, marked a turning point in women's quest for the highest office. "What her loss caused was an igniting of political power inside of millions of women across country who burst into anger and then passion to save their communities, and stepped up to run for office," Schriock said. Emily's List has seen a whopping 60,000 women reach out for support to run for office in the four years since the 2016 election, Schriock said. That compares with 962 women in 2015-16 cycle. Some of those women went on to win a record number of seats in Congress during the 2018 midterms, which helped to flip the house blue and hand the speaker's gavel to Nancy Pelosi. Clinton's historic run also opened the path for the six female Democrats who hit the presidential campaign trail in 2020, including Harris, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand. Yet for all the progress and diversity of the 2020 Democratic primary slate, in the end, voters chose 78-year old white male Joe Biden as the nominee to duke it out with Trump. Dittmar says the "electability myth" guided voter behavior. "Democratic voters were especially motivated by a sense of urgency to beat Donald Trump," she said. And an older white man appeared to be the safest bet. But he chose a 56-year old Black woman as his running mate, making him what Fiorina called "a transitional figure" and "a bridge to the future." She said Harris was instrumental in their victory and President Biden "clearly views her as a partner, as a teammate." So, will Harris be the one who finally makes the leap? Her role is still being written by the administration. There's concern that tie-breaking responsibilities in the Senate will hamper her ability to take on more meaty tasks that will give her the kind of executive experience voters will accept. Harris' background as a biracial woman could make the journey harder if she choses to run. On the 2020 campaign trail she faced discrimination as rival Trump spread a racist birther conspiracy theory based on her immigrant parents, who were from Jamaica and India. Republican officials often mispronounce her first name, which some consider to be discriminatory. "It says you don't belong, you're different," A'shanti Gholar, president of Emerge America, which trains Democratic women to run for office, told the Sacramento Bee . Those obstacles will not go away. What's more, observers say Democrats are unlikely to clear the field in four or eight years for a Harris candidacy amid memories of Hillary Clinton's near-coronation in 2016. A crowded primary is almost a given. Even so, her current platform as vice president gives her advantages no other woman has ever had, if she is given the leadership role that the campaign promised when she got the nod. "Being woman and a woman of color will make it more difficult for her than other vice presidents," Nittle said. "But she's clearly in a better situation to become president than any American woman in history." 
Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent an email to full-time employees following the Atlanta shootings, which killed six Asian women. Pichai offered "time to process" to its full-time employees, nearly half of which identifies as Asian. The U.S. has seen a steep rise in hate crimes against members of Asian America and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities during the Covid-19 pandemic.	Last week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent an email to employees noting the Atlanta shootings' effect on the company's large Asian population. "I know the effects of the hateful violence reach way beyond Atlanta," Pichai stated in a companywide email sent last week. "The loss of these eight lives is tragic — and so is the reality that anybody would be targeted because of their race or gender as appears to be the case here and in so many other recent incidents." Pichai sent the email after a shooting spree in Georgia last week killed eight people, including six Asian women, which spurred nationwide protests over the weekend. Countries including the U.S. have seen a rise in discrimination and violence against members of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities during the Covid-19 pandemic . Google's full-time workforce is 41.9% comprised of Asian-identifying employees, according to the company's latest representation data . Pichai's note to employees went on to say company leaders have checked in with the company's site leads in the Atlanta area. "The news is weighing heavily on all of us," he said. "Please reach out to your managers and teammates if you need support or some time to process." Pichai continued to say the company condemns racism, sexism and violence "in all its forms," adding that it stands with Asian and Pacific Islander communities. Pichai first made a statement in February when he and other tech leaders tweeted the hashtag #StopAsianHate, stating, "It's important that we not let the violence against Asian & Pacific Islander communities fade from the headlines." Watch Now: Asian hate attacks are on the rise
Bank of America has announced an expansion of its previously announced racial justice initiative. The plan is now being extended by one more year, and the bank raised its investment in the program from $1 billion to $1.25 billion. The bank also says it will immediately direct $1 million "in support of increased advocacy, dialogue and engagement with the Asian American community."	Bank of America is expanding its racial justice initiative, devoting more funding toward advocacy and equality for communities of color. "The urgency we feel to address long-standing issues of inclusion and racial inequality has only increased following the attacks and hate speech directed at Asian people over the last year," said Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. The bank announced a four-year commitment backed by $1 billion in June of last year in response to the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor as well as the effects of the pandemic on communities of color, saying "the programs will be focused on assisting people and communities of color that have experienced a greater impact from the health crisis." The initiative is now being extended by one more year and the bank raised its investment in the program to $1.25 billion . The bank says the additional funds "will further support investments to address racial justice, advocacy and equality for people and communities of color, including those of Asian descent." Bank of America said that it has already invested $350 million from the initial $1 billion in areas of health, jobs and reskilling, affordable housing, and small business. Initiatives the bank supported with the funding include applying more than $13 million committed to Native American communities , distributing 25 million masks to underserved communities across the U.S. and partnering with 21 higher education institutions and major employers for skill enhancement for Black and Hispani students. The bank also says it will immediately direct $1 million "in support of increased advocacy, dialogue and engagement with the Asian American community." These immediate actions include a grant to the Asian Americans Advancing Justice and the addition of Connie Chung Joe , CEO of Los Angeles' Asian Americans Advancing Justice, to serve as a member of Bank of America's National Community Advisory Council . The bank will also provide additional support for the National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development and The Leadership Conference Education Fund . Bank of America added that it will match employee donations to these organizations in an effort to double donations through its matching gift program. "The rising number of attacks against Asian people, including the tragic shootings in Atlanta recently, have served as a stark reminder that we must stand united against discrimination, hate speech and violence," said Thong Nguyen, vice chairman at Bank of America. "We will not tolerate acts of racism in any form. Today's commitment builds upon Bank of America's many years of work in support of inclusion and racial equality."
Michael Jordan and his Jordan Brand company will launch a community grants program for social organizations assisting Black communities through his apparel brand. The funds are from Jordan and the company's $100 million commitment that was established last year. Phoenix Suns vice-chairman Jahm Najafi also donated $10 million to the National Basketball Association's foundation to enhance economic opportunities in the Black community.	Michael Jordan is taking the next step to his $100 million commitment to the Black community. Through his Jordan Brand company, the basketball icon will offer social organizations funds from a $1 million community grant program to help meet objectives in combating issues that plague Black communities. Firms with budgets of $3 million or less will be considered for the grants. Applicants can apply until April 30, are required to be U.S.-based and 501(c)(3) confirmed. Non-profit group Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors is coordinating the program, which will distribute money from Jordan brand's $100 million pledge to fight racism and income inequality. "Since announcing our commitment to the Black Community in June of 2020, we've been focused on two things – action and impact," Jordan brand president Craig Williams said in a statement. "I'm excited about the impact these grants will have in the Black Community. We know that when we create positive change for the Black Community, there is a benefit for almost every other group." Jordan's brand joined top companies who donated funds to the Black community following a series of high-profile police killings in 2020, including George Floyd's death. Former police officer Derek Chauvin is currently standing trial for killing Floyd and faces charges of second and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The Jordan brand made donations of up to $1 million last July, distributing money from the pledge to the NAACP, the Formerly Incarcerated and Convicted People and Families Movement (FICPFM), and Black Voters Matter organization. Phoenix Suns vice-chairman Jahm Najafi also donated $10 million to the National Basketball Association's foundation on Wednesday. The money is in addition to the $10 million the Suns pledged. Najafi is the CEO of Arizona-based venture capital firm Najafi Companies . The league and its players union donated $300 million to enhance social and economic opportunities in the Black community through the NBA Foundation last year. Najafi made the headlines in February when he joined former NFL star Colin Kaepernick to form a special-purpose acquisition company (Mission Advancement Corp). The company aims to address race and diversity matters by acquiring direct-to-consumer sports and financial technology companies. Mission Advancement raised $345 million after an IPO on March 5 and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol " MACC ." "This past year I have been inspired by the NBA family's efforts to advance social justice, especially through the Board of Governor's long-term commitment in creating the NBA Foundation," said Najafi in a statement. "I've seen firsthand how economic opportunity can change lives, and I look forward to supporting the Foundation over the next 10 years as they impact the lives of Black youth."
Merck CEO Ken Frazier is helping lead an effort among Black business executives to push corporate America to be more vocal in favor of voting rights. "Corporations have to stand up. There is no middle ground," ex-American Express CEO Ken Chenault, another organizer, told CNBC on Wednesday. The effort comes following a new law in Georgia that critics say will disproportionately hurt voters of color.	A group of Black business executives are imploring corporate leaders in the U.S. to take forceful stands against efforts to restrict voting access, following a new law in Georgia that critics say will disproportionally hurt voters of color. Two of the organizers — Merck CEO Ken Frazier and Ken Chenault , former American Express CEO — appeared Wednesday on CNBC's "Squawk Box," describing the effort as a moral obligation in the face of longstanding injustices faced by Black voters. "Corporations have to stand up. There is no middle ground," said Chenault, who was one of the first Black chief executives at a Fortune 500 company. "This is about all Americans having the right to vote, but we need to recognize the special history of the denial of the right to vote for Black Americans, and we will not be silent," he added. Republicans lawmakers in Georgia supported the state's recent legislation, and Democrats opposed it. Former President Donald Trump , who lost to Biden, and other Republicans have falsely claimed that Georgia's election last year was rife with voter fraud. President Joe Biden in November became the first Democrat to win Georgia since 1992 , and two Democrats — Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — also defeated their GOP opponents in runoff elections. Civil rights groups in Georgia have been critical of some of the state's largest companies for not being more vocal and direct in opposing the legislation before it was signed into law last week by GOP Gov. Brian Kemp. A number of companies issued statements later Wednesday , after the Frazier and Chenault interview, that expressed support for voting rights. And in a memo to employees Wednesday morning, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian expressed his displeasure with the final version of the Georgia legislation, calling it "unacceptable." The CEO of another Georgia company, Coca-Cola 's James Quincey, told CNBC the new law is "wrong." Kemp, in an interview on CNBC's "Closing Bell," dismissed the corporate push back, repeatedly contending that it makes voting more secure in the state while touting its provisions to make ballot drop boxes permanently part of elections, for example. "There were counties last year that didn't even have a drop box because it's never appeared in the law before," Kemp said, noting the law mandates all Georgia counties have at least one drop box. However, critics say the legislation will have the effect of reducing their availability in populous counties like Fulton and Dekalb. "We have 159 counties in Georgia. One hundred and thirty-four of those counties under this legislation will be offering more hours of early voting, not less, so I would encourage these CEOs to look at these other states they're doing business in, and compare what the real facts are to Georgia, and I think their focus will probably need to be in other places and not here," Kemp said. Earlier Wednesday, Frazier stressed that he was concerned about restrictive voting proposals being introduced in other states. "Georgia is the leading edge of a movement all around this country to restrict voting access," Frazier said. He added, "These kinds of bills have to be stopped in their tracks because you have to actually spend time reading this bill to understand what it does, and I think corporations ought to take a very strong stand in Georgia and every place else." Frazier pushed back strongly on the suggestion that, by specifically condemning the Georgia changes and similar efforts being pushed in other states , corporations would mistakenly wade into tangles of partisan politics. "If we allow a party to adopt as one of its fundamental strategies voter suppression, then I don't think the answer should be, 'Well we can't comment on voter suppression because otherwise we're being partisan,'" said Frazier, who is set to retire as Merck CEO later this year after a decade at the helm. "Free and fair access to the ballot was never a partisan issue. It's a fundamental constitutional right." For the Georgia law, in particular, Frazier stressed he was not claiming every single provision was restrictive and hurt Black voters. For example, proponents of the bill note it mandates two Saturdays of early voting leading up to general elections, when previously only one had been required. Many other aspects are problematic, Frazier contended, such as limits on the locations and accessibility of ballot drop boxes, as well restrictions on giving food and water to voters while they wait in line. Other critics have noted the law shortens the time allowed to request an absentee ballot .  "In totality, these changes will make it much harder for certain voters to vote," Frazier said. "There's already not equal access," Frazier added, referencing data that shows longer wait times for Black voters in Georgia than white counterparts. "What we're saying is that state by state, in the absence of substantiated and compelling evidence of voter fraud, any actions that are taken to restrict the ability of eligible voters to vote should be opposed," he said. Among the dozens of business leaders backing Frazier and Chenault's efforts is Mellody Hobson , co-CEO and president of Ariel Investments. Hobson earlier this month became chair of Starbucks ' board. She's the only Black chairwoman of an S&P 500 company. Tony West , chief legal officer at Uber , and Vista Equity Partners founder and CEO Robert Smith also signed the letter organized by Frazier and Chenault, which was published as an ad in Wednesday's edition of The New York Times. Companies have to recognize their power to create change on critical aspects of democracy, Chenault said. "If they can't speak out on this issue, what can they speak out on?" he asked, rhetorically. "People should not be focused on, 'Will it hurt me if I take a stand?" he added. "With all due respect, many people died for the right to vote, and this one where we're asking corporations to take a moral stand. If corporations had done this throughout our history, we would be far further along in race relations in this country," Chenault concluded. Mallory Blount, a spokesperson for Kemp, contrasted Georgia's policies for early voting to those of New Jersey, where Merck is headquartered, and New York, where Chenault's former employer American Express is based. New Jersey just enacted early in-person voting this week, although the state already had early in-person absentee voting . And New York, unlike the majority of states including Georgia , does not have no-excuse absentee voting, Blount noted. "We look forward to Mr. Frazier and Mr. Chenault both advocating for their states to join Georgia in increasing voter access and securing the ballot box," she said in an email. — CNBC's Hannah Miao contributed to this report.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that the Latino community has been hit "disproportionately hard" by the last five economic crises in the United States. "If someone tried to design an economic crisis that would unduly target the Hispanic community, they'd probably come up with something that looks a lot like Covid-19," Yellen said in virtual remarks before the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday. A Stanford University study revealed that the odds of loan approval from national banks were 60% lower for Latino-owned businesses than white-owned businesses, even when controlling for performance.	Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warns that the Latino community has been hit "disproportionately hard" by the last five economic crises in the United States. "I took my first economics course around 1963. Since then, our country has endured at least 5 major economic crises," she said in remarks she delivered Tuesday at the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. "Each of these crises was very different but they all shared at least once significant characteristic: They all hit Latino-Americans disproportionately hard." Yellen also summarized her remarks in a thread on Twitter. In the virtual remarks, Yellen said that the Hispanic unemployment rate is always higher than the national average, and when there is a crisis, the Hispanic rate always spikes higher. "Economic crises generally do this: They take pre-existing inequalities — and make them even more unequal," Yellen said. "If someone tried to design an economic crisis that would unduly target the Hispanic community, they'd probably come up with something that looks a lot like Covid-19," she said. "One-in-five Latino households still say they don't have enough food to eat," Yellen noted. She said that the American Rescue Plan and the Paycheck Protection Program were meant to help Americans who have been hit hard by the pandemic. "PPP was supposed to be an early lifeline, but because of issues with the program's design, the first rounds often didn't reach the smallest businesses, which are disproportionately Hispanic-owned," Yellen said. Latino-owned businesses often drive a large portion of the country's recovery after an economic crisis, the Treasury Secretary said. She noted that from 2007 to 2012 the number of these businesses grew by 3.3%. In comparison, businesses with non-Hispanic owners declined by 3.6% in that period. "And after 2012, the number of new Latino-owned business grew at more than twice the national average," Yellen said. A Stanford University study found that the odds of loan approval from national banks were 60% lower for Latino-owned businesses than white-owned businesses. The Secretary said that the Treasury gearing up to inject $12 billion dollars into Community Development Financial Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions. It's more money than has flowed through these programs since they were created in the 90s, Yellen said. She said thinks the money will make a "meaningful difference" in Latino-owned firms' ability to access capital, but explained that it is only just a start. "If [we] work together, then I am confident that when someone looks back at the economic data around the pandemic, they won't simply conclude that Hispanic workers and businesses were the victims of the 2020 economy. They'll see that they were builders of a better one in 2021 and beyond." Yellen said.
"I think we have a lot to say and, therefore, a lot to do," Jon M. Chu said during CNBC's "Race and Opportunity in America" special on Wednesday. "I think the doors are opening now." Chu is perhaps best known for directing "Crazy Rich Asians." His newest film "In the Heights" arrives this summer.	Perhaps best known for his work on 2018's "Crazy Rich Asians," Jon M. Chu has been working as a director in Hollywood since 2008. His films span multiple genres, ranging from romantic comedies and dramas to action flicks and, most recently, musicals. Chu's latest release, a filmed version of Lin-Manuel Miranda's Tony Award-winning Broadway hit "In the Heights," is due out this summer. Next, he'll take on Stephen Schwartz's "Wicked." "I think we have a lot to say and, therefore, a lot to do," Chu said during CNBC's "Race and Opportunity in America" special on Wednesday. "I think the doors are opening now." However, the journey to the director's chair wasn't an easy one for Chu. "I would say one of the biggest barriers for me growing up was the fact that people didn't think Hollywood was a place for an Asian-American director," Chu said. "There were Asian directors from other places, but an Asian-American director, the voice of that, the who we are and what we have to say, I think, wasn't quite there yet." In the last few years, Asian representation in Hollywood has grown, but there's still room for improvement. Chu, for his part, in 2018 helped bring the first Hollywood release to feature a mostly Asian cast to the big screen since 1993's "The Joy Luck Club." "Crazy Rich Asians" tallied $238 million globally and was widely embraced by critics and audiences alike. "Representation is showing the world who you are at, at its most intimate levels," Chu said. "Showing your languages, not just actual word languages but the love language of food, the love language of insults, of class in terms of what self-worth is, not just the worth of your car." "Crazy Rich Asians" focused heavily on how it feels for an Asian-American to go through a cultural identity crisis when traveling to Asia for the first time, Chu said. The realization being that Asian-Americans belong to both worlds. "I think sharing our culture on the big screen where people have to pay money or subscribe to, saying we're worth your time and your space to hear our stories is huge," he said.
The pandemic has worsened the global gender gap, and the World Economic Forum predicts it will now take 135.6 years to reach parity, up from about 100 years before the crisis hit. "100 years to global gender parity was already not good enough, and now (it is) 136 years globally," said Saadia Zahidi, a managing director at the World Economic Forum. One reason why the gender gap has widened is that sectors hit hard by Covid-19 — such as tourism and retail — happen to employ many women, she said.	The World Economic Forum predicts it will now take 135.6 years to reach gender equality — as the pandemic set the world back by a generation, delaying parity by about 36 years . Saadia Zahidi, a managing director at the World Economic Forum, told CNBC that "100 years to global gender parity was already not good enough — and now (it is) 136 years globally." "The pandemic has had a massive impact, and essentially rolled back a lot of the progress that was made in the past," she told CNBC's "Capital Connection" on Wednesday. One reason why the gender gap has widened is that sectors hit hard by Covid-19 mostly employed women. "Whether that's travel and tourism that's shut down globally, or (the) consumer and retail sector that has been impacted in so many countries, these are large employers of women," Zahidi said. Another factor is that many women took on extra responsibilities at home during the lockdowns as schools closed. "That has then meant a sort of a 'double shift' for women," she said. The WEF said data from market research firm Ipsos  suggest this "double shift" of paid and unpaid work contributed to an increase in stress, anxiety around job security and difficulty in maintaining work-life balance. Zahidi said governments have a "critical role to play" in closing the gender gap. For example, she said authorities could invest in infrastructure to care for children and the elderly, which would help because such responsibilities fall to women in "traditional" homes. Employers can also help women out of higher relative job losses and lower hiring rates in industries that are bouncing back, she added. "If businesses want to have the … creativity and innovation that will get them out of the crisis, they need diversity, and so they need to think of this as a business investment as well," Zahidi said.
WNBA superstar Sue Bird, among the best players to ever play pro basketball, is featured in a series of CarMax advertisements that recently went viral on social media. Sports marketing professor Nancy Lough told CNBC the ads represent a "new standard" for elevating female athletes. "She's won championships in different decades with the same team. She's just an icon," said senior copywriter Graham Unterberger, who worked on the campaign.	A series of CarMax advertisements featuring WNBA superstar Sue Bird , which recently went viral on social media, uses humor and misdirection to elevate female athletes who have faced decades of underrepresentation in media. Bird's accomplishments on the court put her among the best players to ever play professional basketball. The ads — part of CarMax's "Call Your Shot" campaign — were released earlier this month but took off on Twitter over the weekend. The spot gaining the most attention starred Bird, NBA standout Steph Curry and an actor portraying a CarMax employee who was overjoyed to sell a vehicle to an athlete of Bird's caliber. It challenges gender bias in sports. "I think it's setting a new standard because it has resonated so positively with so many people," said Nancy Lough , a professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas , who studies sports marketing and gender equity. The commercial understands that "today's consumer is smart," she told CNBC. "They want to be respected. Women want to be respected, but men appreciate that [there] needs to be respect across the board." In the ad, the CarMax associate tells Curry, "Man, if you'd have told me this morning I'd be working with a four-time champ ..." Before he can finish, he's interrupted by the Golden State Warriors guard, who believes he's correcting the CarMax rep by saying he's only won three league titles. "No. I sold a car to Sue Bird," the employee says in the ad, pointing across the lot as the camera cuts to Bird, a longtime Seattle Storm guard, who is seen waving and stepping into the vehicle. "Eleven all-star appearances, can you imagine?" the salesman asks. Curry, a 33-year-old seven-time NBA all-star, responds, "I mean, I'm working on it." The commercial has resonated on social media; in one Twitter post, the video has 1.7 million views . "This is the best ad I've ever seen," tweeted Sarah Fuller , the two-sport Vanderbilt University athlete who last year became the first woman to score points in a Power 5 conference college football game. The viral moment for the CarMax ads comes as Bird's alma mater, the University of Connecticut, plays in the women's NCAA basketball tournament's Final Four on Friday. The women's games this year have enjoyed strong viewership following the rise in popularity of the WNBA in its Covid-shortened season last year. The WNBA's 2021 season, its 25th, is expected to begin later this spring. Graham Unterberger — a senior copywriter at the Martin Agency , which worked on the CarMax campaign — said he found out that Bird was partnering with the auto retailer in the fall, around the time the Storm won the WNBA title for the fourth time. "When we saw her name, we were like, 'This is freaking awesome. We have the best basketball player on the planet that we can write spots for,'" Unterberger said in a video call with CNBC. "After writing spots, we saw the potential to pair [Curry and Bird] together." One reason the commercial starring Bird and Curry strikes a chord is that it places a female athlete's career accolades firmly above those of a male athlete, Lough said. "Historically, traditionally and very commonplace today, a WNBA athlete being compared to an NBA athlete is always positioned as though the WNBA is lesser than, and, in this case, we actually get to see that flipped in a really fun and clever and novel new way," she said. The ad is also a testament to the recognizable brand that Bird has built across her nearly two decades in the WNBA, Lough added. The No. 1 pick in the 2002 draft, Bird has spent her entire WNBA career with the Storm, recording the most assists in league history . The 40-year-old Bird is returning for the upcoming 2021 season . In the past, companies that wanted to use an athlete to help build their brand have generally just turned to male sports figures, Lough said. However, there has been a shift toward better marketing representation of female athletes, she added, pointing to tennis stars Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka as examples. Bird's series with CarMax — which recently became the WNBA's first-ever official auto retail partner — serves as the latest chapter of that welcome evolution, Lough said. Another instance came earlier this month, when Los Angeles Sparks forward Chiney Ogwumike , a two-time WNBA all-star and ESPN commentator , starred in a solo ad campaign for food-delivery service DoorDash . As the creative process for the Curry-Bird ad progressed, they simply "let the one with the most rings win out," according to Dustin Dodd, the Martin Agency's senior art director. "I don't know how you look at Sue Bird's resume and not say, 'GOAT,'" Unterberger added, using an acronym for greatest of all time. "It just is what it is." "To us, when you think about the WNBA's rise in recent years, Sue Bird is a huge part of that history and a huge part of bringing that game forward," he said. "She's won championships in different decades with the same team. She's just an icon." Bird and Curry were never on location together to film the commercial, Dodd said. Bird was in Connecticut, while Curry was in California. The video shoots also took place weeks apart. "We just had to cobble it together the best way possible, and luckily it's resonated with people," he said. In another one of the six ads in the series starring Bird, she tells the actor representing a CarMax associate her middle name is "Buckets" — a basketball slang term — after being asked for that bit of info to complete a sales form. Following seconds of awkward silence, she tells him, "Nah, it's Brigit." Another centers around CarMax delivering a purchased vehicle directly to Bird's home. She relays the gate password to the employee over an intercom letter by letter, and viewers find out the entrance code spells out "GOAT." Unterberger said he's appreciated the conversation the ads featuring Bird have sparked around boosting representation of female athletes, suggesting other companies should take note. "It's not just WNBA fans. It's not just NBA fans. It's blossomed into this bigger thing, and I think that alone should prove that this is a worthy endeavor," he said. The commercials gained traction online as the women's and men's college basketball tournaments were entering their later rounds and disparities in accommodations at the two NCAA tournaments — particularly around weight room equipment and different types of Covid tests — were sharply criticized earlier this month . Lough said she thought both the widespread condemnation of the tournament inequities and the positive response to the CarMax ads with Bird were significant in their own ways when it comes to advancing gender equity in athletics. "We've had waves of attention in women's sports," she added, recalling the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta when the U.S. women's soccer team won the gold medal. "But right now, it's different." "This is a wave of momentum that has been building for some time," she said, "and quite honestly, I don't see it stopping, and that's new."
South Asia is facing a "wake up moment" as it trails the world in its efforts to address the gender gap, Michael Page Australia's senior managing director has said. The World Economic Forum is now predicting it could take the region 195 years to reach gender equality — two generations more than the global average. India lags Asia Pacific in terms of female leadership, with just 13% of senior executive positions held by women. Thailand tops the list.	South Asia is facing a wake up call as it trails the world in its efforts to address the gender gap, one expert told CNBC. The World Economic Forum predicts it could now take 195 years to reach gender equality in the region — 59 years more than the global average. Businesses have a major responsibility to bridge that gap, Sharmini Wainwright, senior managing director at recruitment agency Michael Page Australia, told CNBC. "It's perhaps a good wake up moment here," Wainwright said Thursday. India, in particular, has a long way to go in this regard, she said, noting that the pandemic and other cultural and demographic issues made it an "incredibly challenging year" for the country. Currently, just 13% of senior executives in India are women. "There's a long way to go," said Wainwright. "Big Indian companies (need) to really push for change." The findings come as part of a wider WEF study into the impact of the pandemic on gender gap. It is now estimated that it will take 135.6 years to reach gender equality — a generation longer than previously thought. Western Europe led the way in gender equity, with the gap there estimated to close in 53 years, followed by North America (62 years) and Latin America and the Caribbean (69 years), according to the study. Other parts of Asia-Pacific showed signs of progress, however. Most notably, Thailand saw more than half (53%) of senior executive roles being filled by women in 2020. Those  senior women executives  tended to be a combination of international as well as homegrown talent, particularly within multinational companies in the manufacturing and supply chain sectors. "What you've got is an economy and a market that is moving very quickly and pursuing talent very aggressively," said Wainwright. She added that it was also the result of concerted efforts in recent decades by certain industries, such as manufacturing, to attract and nurture a pipeline of women leaders. "Now, 20 years later, you've seen the benefit of that, of individuals who've really taken the opportunity to enjoy exceptional careers within this sector and really rise into leadership roles within that," she said. Still, too few women today occupy the top leadership position, namely the chief executive's role. According to the report, the top three job titles held by senior women executives were chief finance officer, marketing director and legal director. Wainwright described that as the next "big breakthrough that needs to happen," and called on men to be better allies. "How do we break through to that number one seat? That's still yet to come," she said. "This conversation is equally about males as it is females. They're the ones typically in the positions of highest influence to make a change, to make a decision."
The NBA will distribute over $3 million in grants as part of its 10-year, $300 million commitment to help Black people. "The NBA Foundation's mission to drive economic empowerment for Black communities through employment and career advancement is essential to the mobility and prosperity of future generations," said Greg Taylor, NBA Foundation executive director.	The National Basketball Association announced another set of grants to social organizations on Monday as it tries to boost economic opportunities in the Black community. As part of its $300 million commitment to assist underserved areas,  the league selected nine organizations, including New York-based New Heights Youth, City Year, Road to Hire, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Miami and Memphis-based CodeCrew. More than $3 million will be distributed in this round of grants. The NBA said the money would support firms in creating employment and assist in career advancements among Black people. "The grants will enhance and build upon the important work of these national and local organizations that align with the NBA Foundation's mission to provide skills training, mentorship, coaching and pipeline development for high school, college-aged, job-ready and mid-career individuals in Black communities across the United States and Canada," the league said. Last year, the NBA and its players' union collaborated to create the NBA Foundation, which promises to help Black people over the next 10 years. All 30 NBA clubs will unite to commit $30 million annually over the next decade, as the league wants to improve economic and income inequality. "The NBA Foundation's mission to drive economic empowerment for Black communities through employment and career advancement is essential to the mobility and prosperity of future generations," NBA Foundation executive director Greg Taylor told CNBC via email. "We're excited to continue our work and honor our second round of grant recipients that are making firsthand impact in their communities and on individual lives." Pro sports leagues upped their interest in helping Black communities in 2020 after high-profile killings involving police made the headlines, including George Floyd's death. Former Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin is on trial for his role in Floyd's killing last May. The NBA made its first installment of grants last December to assist in education and employment opportunities. Organizations including the Marcus Graham Project, Operation DREAM, and Management Leadership for Tomorrow were selected to receive the funds. Phoenix Suns co-owner Jahm Najafi added a $10 million donation to the foundation last month. The money is in addition to the $10 million the Suns already pledged. Najafi is CEO of Arizona-based venture capital firm Najafi Companies. Correction: The headline of this story has been updated to reflect this is the second grant distribution from the NBA.
Goldman Sachs, Starbucks and other companies are backing an initiative called NinetyToZero to help close the racial wealth gap in the U.S. Addressing the wealth disparity is critical to solving other societal problems, Robin Hood foundation CEO Wes Moore told CNBC. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who appeared alongside Moore on "Squawk Box," stressed the need for organizations to be accountable.	Goldman Sachs , Starbucks and a range of other organizations across the U.S. announced Tuesday a collaborative effort aimed at narrowing the racial wealth gap between Black and white Americans. The initiative, called NinetyToZero, also includes the American Civil Liberties Union, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the Robin Hood foundation as backers. "A handful of folks got together and said, 'We have a coordinated problem that we have to deal with, and the only way we're going to deal with it is a coordinated solution'," Robin Hood CEO Wes Moore said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "The problem we're trying to solve for was the fact that there is this 10-to-1 racial wealth gap that we have with the United States between Black families and white families," added Moore, who is set to step down from the New York City-based anti-poverty nonprofit next month. That 90% gap is where NinetyToZero's name is drawn from. The wealth disparity between Black and white Americans has grown throughout U.S. history as the result of exploitation, discrimination and segregation. Through the initiative, NinetyToZero partner organizations will set goals and track progress on a number of areas such as hiring Black employees, as well as spending and relationships with Black-owned businesses. It also includes factoring efforts around inclusion into "executive accountability," according to a press release . Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO David Solomon, who appeared alongside Moore on "Squawk Box," stressed the need for organizations to be accountable. "One of the reasons I signed onto this initiative with Wes and NinetyToZero is, I looked at the things we were doing through our various programs and I said, 'We're doing a lot of this, but this gives us another set of metrics, another set of goals where we can use our capital and our resources to try to make a difference,'" Solomon said. While Robin Hood is initially "incubating" NinetyToZero, it will eventually become independent of the nonprofit, the statement said. "The ability to solve any challenge became more and more difficult — and frankly, impossible — if we do not deal with the fact that this racial wealth gap continues to impede any form or growth or progress," Moore said. NinetyToZero is the latest corporate action in the past year focused on addressing racial inequality in the U.S. Following the death of George Floyd in police custody last May, many companies announced financial investments in Black communities and organizations, as well as other internal efforts, such as reforming hiring practices . Solomon said shareholders and capital allocators have placed a greater emphasis on racial equality. "The reason for that is, I think people believe that diverse and inclusive organizations — and also progress on some of the issues that [Moore] is highlighting this morning — drives additional economic output, which brings everyone along." Companies need to understand the role they can play in driving that progress, Moore added. "Whether you're talking about historical factors like the ending of apartheid South Africa, whether you're talking about the hanging of the name of football teams, corporate weight matters in these conversations," he said. Other companies and organizations that have already joined NinetyToZero include Lord Abbett, Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health and McKinsey & Co.
People with disabilities are often omitted from conversations around diversity, equity and inclusion. Sixty-one million adults live with a disability in the U.S., and they are more than twice as likely to be poor than adults with no disability. Many people with disabilities can and want to work, and many can work effectively with minimal assistance. But health-care and benefits programs can hinder their ability to join the workforce. Employers should modify recruitment strategies and widen their talent pool by offering apprenticeship programs that enable partnerships with special education programs and local disability organizations.	2020 brought forward a crucial national conversation centered on the need for companies — from Main Street to Wall Street — to look inward at hiring practices, employment policies, recruitment and other aspects of the employment process to expand opportunities for diversity, equity and inclusion. It seems every company in the United States, from Google to Pepsi to the family-owned small business down your street, is exploring DEI strategies and tactics to attract new employees, retain existing employees and appeal to a wider customer base. You can't log into LinkedIn or Indeed without viewing a new job post for an executive dedicated to internally championing DEI. You can't scroll through Instagram or Facebook without coming across a new consumer-directed social media campaign like L'Oréal's new partnership with the NAACP . And you can't shop at your favorite store without noticing the latest social justice philanthropy initiative like Crate & Barrel's new 15 Percent Pledge to ensure 15% of its products and collaborations are represented by Black businesses, artists and designers by 2024. However, as our country continues the necessary conversation around DEI, and organizations and companies further deploy creative strategies to address systemic problems, we are overlooking the most underemployed and unemployed segment of our entire U.S.-based population — people with disabilities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 61 million adults live with a disability in the U.S. — that is, 26%, or about 1 in 4 adults. In 2019, the Department of Labor reported that 7.3% of people with disabilities were unemployed — about twice as high as the rate for those without a disability. Where are the consumer-directed campaigns featuring people with visible (and invisible) disabilities? Where are the social justice campaigns to support products and businesses owned by people with disabilities? And, most importantly, why aren't more companies employing people with disabilities? Despite Congress passing the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, and subsequent amendments in 2008, systemic problems continue to pose significant structural, economic, educational and regulatory barriers for employers and people with disabilities alike. The poverty rate for adults with disabilities (27%) is more than twice the rate of adults with no disability (12%). Some will say the reason for this is complicated. We disagree. People with disabilities are forced to live within a health-care and benefits system that was designed in the 1960s, when people with disabilities were institutionalized, often from birth. Even in 2021, for a person with a disability to qualify for benefits under entitlement programs, the only option for health care and services is their state Medicaid program (51 different bureaucratic programs that are complex and cumbersome for individuals, family members and caregivers). People with disabilities must also navigate a complex, limited employment sector that is rooted in outdated low expectations and stereotypes — limited options that look more like the 1980s than the 2020s. Many people with disabilities are living in poverty because their only government support (that is, Medicaid and Social Security) is not specifically designed to support their disability. Individuals are limited in terms of what they can earn (approximately $735 per month) and how much they can save at any given time ($2,000). These means-tested program qualifications are based on 1964 income measures. Fifty-seven years later, it's time to address these outmoded systems and programs. It's time to decouple the poor from the disability community and start to create incentives to move people with disabilities into jobs — and careers. Many people with disabilities can and want to work, and many can work effectively with minimal assistance. In many cases, applying for government support designed to help those on low incomes and living in poverty is the only way people with disabilities can survive because they lack the experience, opportunity, encouragement and support needed to move them into sustainable employment. Every organization, including government, can help redress this situation and help the largest, unemployed population of individuals living in the U.S. today: As we move into 2021 and begin the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, it makes sense to think about ways to maximize workforce participation, and a strong focus on DEI is critical to positioning the economy for recovery and growth. And as we discuss what DEI success should look like in the U.S., it's time for policymakers and employers to step up and do their part to tap into the most unemployed population in this country — people with disabilities.

Target said it will spend more than $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by 2025 by adding new brands to its shelves, hiring Black-owned construction or advertising firms and launching a new program fort start-ups. Over the past year, major companies like Nike, Walmart and Ulta Beauty have rolled out their own racial-equity pledges, such as featuring more Black people in their ads and reducing the number of police or security in stores. Generation Z — the group of teens and early 20-somethings who are aging into shopping and establishing relationships with brands — care more about social justice than previous generations, according to an annual survey of teens by Piper Sandler released Wednesday.	Target said it will hire more Black-owned companies, launch a program to identify and support promising minority entrepreneurs and add products from more than 500 Black-owned brands to its shelves or website. Altogether, the discounter said Wednesday, it will spend more than $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by 2025. "We have a rich history of working with diverse businesses, but there's more we can do to spark change across the retail industry, support the Black community and ensure Black guests feel welcomed and represented when they shop at Target," chief growth officer Christina Hennington said in a news release. The killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and protests across the country have ratcheted up pressure on corporate leaders to advance racial equity and do more than simply cut a check — or risk losing business. The uneven death toll of the coronavirus pandemic and financial toll of the recession also spotlighted the country's sharp racial disparities with health care and economic opportunity. Floyd was killed in Target's hometown of Minneapolis, now the site of the murder trial for the police officer who kneeled on Floyd's neck. One Target store, located near the site of Floyd's death, had to be completely rebuilt and some of its other stores were damaged during rioting. Companies have spoken out about diversity and inclusion as consumers pay attention and some direct their dollars toward businesses that align with their values. Generation Z — the group of teens and early 20-somethings who are aging into shopping and establishing relationships with brands — care more about social justice compared with former generations, according to an annual survey of teens by Piper Sandler released Wednesday. Teens surveyed by the firm ranked racial equity as their most important political and social issue, followed by the environment and Black Lives Matter. Over the past year, major retailers like Nike , Walmart and Ulta Beauty have rolled out their own pledges, such as devoting more shelf space to Black-owned products, evaluating how they hire and promote employees, featuring more Black people in their ads and reducing the number of police or security in stores to prevent racial profiling. A growing number of retailers, including Macy's , Sephora and Gap , have signed on to the 15 Percent Pledge, which aims to make Black-owned products on store shelves proportional to the country's Black population. Among Target's changes, the retailer said it will more actively seek out advertising firms, suppliers, construction companies and other kinds of businesses that are Black-owned. It said it will create a program called Forward Founders for early-stage start-ups led by Black entrepreneurs to help them develop, test and scale products to sell at mass retailers like Target. It will be modeled off of Target Accelerators , a program for start-ups that the retailer uses to foster up-and-coming brands and ultimately, to sell fresh and exclusive products that attract customers and help it differentiate from competitors. In some categories, such as beauty, Target said it already has 50 Black-owned and Black-founded brands — but would like to add more for other kinds of merchandise. Target previously committed to increasing Black representation in its workforce by 20% over the next three years. The company and its foundation are also giving $10 million to nonprofit organizations focused on addressing barriers for Black communities.
The company said that 18% of its corporate and investment bank summer interns in North America are Black this year, a 64% increase from 2020, when the level was 11%, according to figures provided by New York-based JPMorgan. One reason the bank is making progress has been the use of two software programs that help recruiters sift through more candidates than previously was the case, according to Rob Walke, global head of campus recruiting for the corporate and investment bank. The bank used to focus campus recruiting primarily on 17 or 18 of the most prestigious universities including Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania, he said. While students from those schools are still highly sought after, the process often led to candidates with a similar background to employees who had previously graduated from the schools.	JPMorgan Chase boosted the number of Black and female college students selected for investment bank internships by leaning on technology platforms that help the firm broaden out its campus recruiting efforts, CNBC has learned. The company said that 18% of its corporate and investment bank summer interns in North America are Black this year, a 64% increase from 2020, when the level was 11%, according to figures provided by New York-based JPMorgan. The bank also said female interns make up 55% of the 2021 class globally, from 50% last year. The move at JPMorgan could ultimately begin to change the composition of Wall Street, which for decades has been mostly a bastion for white males, particularly in senior roles. Banks like JPMorgan, which hires about 1,000 summer interns globally, use the programs to vet and train students to become entry-level bankers when they graduate. One reason the bank is making progress has been the use of two software programs that help recruiters sift through more candidates than previously was the case, according to Rob Walke , global head of campus recruiting for the corporate and investment bank. "We've really opened up the way that we hire," Walke said Thursday in a Zoom interview. The intern selection process "should be based upon your skills, your previous experiences and your ability to articulate your competencies for the role, rather than us assuming them based upon the school you're studying at." The bank used to focus campus recruiting primarily on 17 or 18 of the most prestigious universities including Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania, he said. While students from those schools are still highly sought after, the process often led to candidates with a similar background to employees who had previously graduated from the schools. A few years ago, JPMorgan began piloting the use of computer games called pymetrics that aim to objectively measure "cognitive, social and behavioral attributes" of candidates. Hoping to reduce bias in the interview process, the bank also began using a video program called HireVue to automate the first round of candidate interviews. By widening the number of schools it recruits from and creating relationships with historically Black colleges and universities, the bank has been able to select more minorities: Black students will make up 29% of interns in sales and research roles, 24% in global markets roles and 13% of investment-banking interns, JPMorgan said. The firm made similar progress in its asset and wealth management division, which will have 17% Black student interns this year, from 7% in 2020. Most summer interns typically get offered full time positions as first-year analysts when they graduate, according to Walke. The program begins in June and, unlike last year, when the coronavirus pandemic forced interns to work remotely, most investment banking internships will be in person at JPMorgan offices. If the bank is able to retain its Black talent through the first few rungs of the Wall Street hierarchy – analysts rise to become associates, and some eventually get promoted to the vice president title – the move should eventually result in more minorities at higher levels in the organization. Other banks including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have made similar diversity pledges. In 2019, Goldman set " aspirational goals " of having half of all new analysts and entry-level associates hired in the U.S. be women, 11% Black, and 14% Latino. Then, last year Goldman said it would double hiring of junior bankers from Black colleges by 2025. But often the challenge in large organizations is in nurturing minorities and women so that some do ultimately rise in the ranks to become senior managers, acknowledged Brian Lamb , JPMorgan's head of Diversity & Inclusion. To further that cause, the bank has created groups of senior leaders that engage with new hires to help form a sense of community internally, and made diversity and inclusion targets a part of executives' performance and pay evaluations, Lamb said. Still, as is the case at other banks, most of JPMorgan's executive ranks are white. In the U.S., 83% of the bank's operating committee is white, while 79% of the executive team is white, according to an annual disclosure . In the three years since 2018, the ranks of Black employees in mid-level and higher management positions has mostly stayed flat, along with the total workforce level of 13% for Black employees. It's at the first rung of the banking hierarchy, the campus recruiting level, that's seen progress: JPMorgan said 58% of the 2020 class were minorities including Blacks, Asians and Hispanics; that figure should rise this year. "What's important is the trajectory," Lamb said. "Are we seeing gains like we have in the campus recruiting data? Are we seeing year-over-year improvements of women representation and ethnic representation? We're encouraged by the progress, but there's still plenty of work to do."
The Black Wall Street app goes live on June 1 and will offer a digital wallet for peer-to-peer payment and the ability to trade cryptocurrencies. What the Black Wall Street was in Tulsa and the Greenwood district is just very empowering," "The Good Doctor" star Hill Harper told CNBC. The goal of app is to give Black and Latinx investors a gateway into the digital transformation of investing and provide education on crypto.	Nearly a century after Black Wall Street — a center of Black business in the Greenwood district of Tulsa, Oklahoma, that was destroyed in a racial attack — "The Good Doctor" actor Hill Harper is launching a fintech app of the same name to empower investors of color. The Black Wall Street app goes live on June 1 and will offer a digital wallet for peer-to-peer payment and the ability to trade cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether . "What the Black Wall Street was in Tulsa and the Greenwood district is just very empowering," Harper told CNBC about the once thriving Black business district. "There were three pillars that created the wealth that was created in the Black Wall Street [in Tulsa]," he said, with the first two being institutional ownership and institutional trust by the community. "Pillar number three was the movement of money or capital within the ecosystem where dollars changed hands 60 to 100 times within a year before it left that Black community." Harper, who plays Dr. Marcus Andrews on the ABC medical show, said that dollars now leave the Black community within about seven hours. "I truly believe that unless we start owning our own fintech platforms, our own digital wallets, the dollar will leave within six to seven seconds." said Harper, who also played Dr. Sheldon Hawkes on CBS' "CSI: NY." The goal of The Black Wall Street app is to give Black and Latinx investors a gateway into the digital transformation of investing and provide financial education to customers on cryptocurrency. Harper, a Harvard Law School graduate, said he began working with Black web developers last year before the Covid pandemic to build the app, which aims to capitalize on mobile device trends in communities of color. According to a 2019 report from Pew Research Center, 23% of Black Americans and 25% of Latinx Americans are "smart phone only" internet users compared with 12% of white Americans. The Pew study also showed Black Americans use a smartphone for mobile banking more than any other group. Harper said he's hoping to attract "unbanked" consumers and more sophisticated investors looking for a Black-owned site for cryptocurrency purchasing. "It's not just about transferring money to folks, it's about transferring information, ideas, and building community, and we see that that is the real value and the real differentiator." Najah Roberts, a cryptocurrency expert and owner of Crypto Blockchain Plug — a brick-and-mortar location in Inglewood, California, for cryptocurrency education and purchasing — will serve as the chief visionary officer for the app. As part of the launch, The Black Wall Street is planning a 30-city financial literacy tour that begins on April 30 in Los Angeles, with stops in Tulsa on May 31, a century since the original Black Wall Street was destroyed in a riot by white residents. Roberts will lead the tour and give fractional bitcoin shares to people who sign up. The Black Wall Street offering enters a growing industry of fintech apps that allow peer-to-peer transfers including Square 's Cash App from PayPal 's Venmo. Visa estimates there is $4 trillion market for apps that replace the use of cash and checks in the United States. Rapper Killer Mike also launched this year the Greenwood app, another digital platform for investors of color. On The Black Wall Street app, Harper said, "We have to encourage Black ownership and that's what we want to do on the platform. We're starting with a digital wallet and the ability to start to learn financial literacy, create a community, and allow people to invest." "But the ultimate goal is to create a whole ecosystem, and eventually a marketplace where the recirculation, the circulation of dollars through this digital wallet, allows job creation, business creation and job growth," he said.
Former MLB star Alex Rodriguez and Walmart's former e-commerce CEO Marc Lore has agreed to purchase the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves for approximately $1.5 billion.	Alex Rodriguez is finally about to become a sports owner. Months after the former Major League Baseball star came up short in a bid to buy the New York Mets, the National Basketball Association opened up its ownership club. Rodriguez will join former Walmart e-commerce CEO Marc Lore to purchase the Minnesota Timberwolves for a reported $1.5 billion . The move still needs approval from NBA owners, and Timberwolves current owner Glenn Taylor is expected to operate the franchise for two more years while Rodriguez and Lore transition into their ownership roles. "They've asked that I would be there for any decisions that would need to be made," Taylor told the Associated Press . "I would enjoy that. I love teaching people. These are a couple of very bright guys, and I think it could be helpful to the club, and I think I could be helpful to them so that they feel confident once they take over 100%." Taylor will depart the club he purchased in 1994 for approximately $90 million . It's currently one of the most losing franchises in pro sports and in the middle of a rift with its biggest franchise star, Kevin Garnett. Perhaps Rodriguez and Lore can repair the team's relationship and finally get Garnett's jersey retired. But the new group will also need to address how it will build its organization, who will help run the basketball side and what types of owners they'll be on the diversity front. Though Taylor is praised for his work in the Minnesota community as a sports owner, he either failed to assemble great basketball minds or was too inconsistent with selecting front office staff and coaches. And for as much praise as the NBA gets with diversity, the league falls short on teams' C-suite representation. In the 2020 diversity report card , issued annually by the University of Central Florida, the NBA received an F in diversity hires among team CEOs and presidents. Of the 55 positions, 50 are white executives, three are Black, including Dallas Mavericks CEO Cynthia Marshall, who also serves as one of six women in the roles. Timberwolves President Gersson Rosas serves as one of two Hispanic executives. Some eyes are on the Golden State Warriors, as team president Rick Welts will be retiring. The team is said to be considering internal candidates, including Chase Arena's general manager, Kim Stone . The Warriors didn't answer a CNBC request when asked if they are considering any Black executives. Still, the NBA has a diversity problem in higher front offices. Whether the new Timberwolves owners will help or continue to hurt this issue – time will tell. But if they decide to follow any of the hiring trends to help rebuild the franchise, here are a few names to consider: One of the more recent common trends in NBA ownership groups is hiring player agents to run basketball operations. The Los Angeles Lakers turned to Kobe Bryant's longtime agent Rob Pelinka to transform the franchise, while the New York Knicks are gaining success under former CAA representative Leon Rose. The Knicks could be on the verge of making the playoffs for the first time since the 2012-13 season under Rose. Agents are closer to players and know this side of the NBA landscape better than most, so the trend does work. But the agent trend is nothing new. The Phoenix Suns tried this with former agent Lon Babby, and the Golden State Warriors stripped Larry Riley and bequeathed the role to ex-agent Bob Myers to assist in their championship runs. Another name to consider is Aaron Goodwin. Though most know mega agent Rich Paul, who has become perhaps the most prominent NBA agent powerbroker behind the scenes, Goodwin was in place before Paul. Goodwin served as LeBron James' agent when he arrived in the NBA in 2003, helping to negotiate top sneaker contracts. Goodwin was also one of the masterminds behind establishing the NBA's G League Ignite team, where young players earn money while awaiting NBA draft eligibility. Currently, he represents Portland Trail Blazers superstar Damian Lillard and San Antonio Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan. Should the Timberwolves decide to follow this trend, Goodwin has the resume for an executive position. Player agents are one trend, but another is former players with some front office understanding. It's currently working well for the Suns with James Jones and Brooklyn Nets general manager Sean Marks. Malik Rose is another intriguing name. He gained experience both on the G League level with the Atlanta Hawks and the Detroit Pistons front office. Rose is now working inside the league office, gaining familiarity with league operations under Byron Spruell. How much power Elton Brand has in Philadelphia these days under Daryl Morey is anyone's guess. But Brand assisted the 76ers with their transition to an NBA Eastern Conference threat and should be gaining more of an analytical perspective to roster building with Morey in charge. And Michael Finley is gaining experience with Mavericks, serving as the vice president of basketball operations, though he appears to be committed to staying in Dallas. Using this trend, the trio can be among the names that could assist Rodriguez and Lore with team operations should Rosas be replaced under the new regime. And there's nothing wrong with the old trend either – selecting a former or current team executive with extensive NBA knowledge and a track record of success. The Knicks used this trend when they hired former Indiana Pacers executive Donnie Walsh to resurrect the team. In this hiring formula, Toronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri should be highly sought after, given his track record and should he leave Canada. But Ujiri may be unavailable when Rodriguez and Lore take over. Hence, Sacramento Kings advisor Joe Dumars is a longtime figure that knows how to navigate the basketball landscape. Dumars helped orchestrate the Pistons' dominance, especially from 2003 through 2005, when the team won an NBA championship. And sitting right in Rosas' front office is former Hornets (then the Bobcats) president Ed Tapscott, who landed the franchise its arena in Charlotte. And ex-Jordan brand executive and Portland Trail Blazers president Larry Miller is also well respected. He helped rebrand the franchise's " Jail Blazers " era. And Rodriguez and Lore may also want to keep their eyes on the Spurs' front office, where team CEO R.C. Buford is grooming deputy general counsel Brandon James, who has a great understanding of the NBA salary cap and could be emerge as a team president in a few years. Turning to the Spurs' executive trend has served the Oklahoma City Thunder (hired former Spurs executive Sam Presti) and Utah Jazz (Dennis Lindsey) well. The Thunder endured a great run with Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook at the helm, while the Jazz are currently sitting atop the Western Conference and a significant threat to advance to the NBA Finals this season.
"The Federal Reserve System … has a diversity problem," a Brookings Institution report released Tuesday said. The report notes that in the central bank's history, there have been just three Black members of the Fed's board of governors, one Black regional president and only three nonwhite regional presidents overall.	The Federal Reserve has a "staggering" lack of diversity among its directors who are charged with running the central bank's 12 districts, according to a report Tuesday from a leading Washington think tank. "The Federal Reserve System … has a diversity problem," said the Brookings Institution report , authored by economists Peter Conti-Brown and Kaleb Nygaard. "This has long been obvious at the top of the organization, among the members of the Fed's Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks." While those top Fed officials are "overwhelmingly white, overwhelmingly male," the report said, the problem also extends into the boards of directors at the local operations, where "we find a staggering homogeneity among them, with only recent signs of diversification." Directors also are "overwhelmingly drawn from the business communities within their districts, with little participation from minorities, women, or from areas of the economy—labor, nonprofits, the academy—with important contributions to make to Fed governance." The report notes that in the central bank's history, there have been just three Black members of the Fed's board of governors, one Black regional president and only three nonwhite regional presidents. There currently are two female Fed governors out of six — Lael Brainard and Michelle Bowman — and three female regional presidents out of 12 — Esther George in Kansas City, Loretta Mester in Cleveland, and Mary Daly in San Francisco. There is only one Black regional president, Raphael Bostic in Atlanta. In the past few years, the Fed has made some inroads with reserve bank directors, increasing the total of women and minorities from 20 in 2017 to 27 this year. The total for reserve bank branches rose from 42 to 51 during the same period. The report suggests the Fed make the selection process for directors "more transparent" so it can be evaluated in how members are selected. "There is also a sense that these principals are overwhelmingly promoted from within, creating a risk for groupthink and intellectual homogeneity," Conti-Brown and Nygaard wrote. Fed officials have been challenged repeatedly over the lack of diversity within their ranks. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was asked at the issue in February during a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee. "I would say we're not where we want to be on this," the central bank leader said then. "It's something that I'm personally committed with and that all the leadership of the Fed and the whole Fed is very focused on strengthening our workforce diversity." The issues run deeper than the top, though. An examination by the authors, using of the Fed's own research, shows that women and minorities have been underrepresented on the regional boards going back to the bank's inception in 1914. Those boards elect the regional presidents that help the governors make decisions on interest rates and other aspects of monetary policy. No nonwhites served as Fed governor until the late 1970s, and they had less than 10% representation at the director level as late as the latter part of the last decade. It took until the 1990s until women made up 10% of directors, with the total hitting 37% as of 2019. The study also found the manufacturing sector underrepresented and said just 5% of directors held a Ph.D. in economics.
Disney parks has updated its dress and style code for employees, as part of a wider effort to make its employees and guests feel even more welcome at its theme parks. The new guidelines mean cast members won't have to cover their tattoos and can style themselves in costumes that are gender inclusive. The company will also provide more inclusive products like costumes for people in wheelchairs, LGBTQ Mickey ears, and revamp attractions in the parks to feature more diversity.	A new initiative within Disney's parks division means cast members won't have to cover their tattoos and can style themselves in costumes that are gender inclusive. On Tuesday, Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney parks, experiences and products, revealed the update to the company's dress and style code, as part of a wider effort to make its employees and guests feel even more welcome at its theme parks. "Moving forward, we believe our cast, who are at the center of the magic that lives in all our experiences, can provide the best of Disney's legendary guest service when they have more options for personal expression – creating richer, more personal and more engaging experiences with our guests." D'Amaro wrote in a blog post on Disney's website Tuesday. One of the first things that every Disney cast member learns when joining the parks team is the "four keys" — safety, courtesy, show and efficiency. These "keys" are guidelines for employee etiquette and are aimed at providing a seamless guest experience. For example, if a young guest drops a bucket of popcorn on the sidewalk of Main Street, a cast member will quickly work to provide that guest with a new bucket, while another cast member cleans up the spill. Last fall, after 65 years, Disney added a fifth key — inclusion. "We want our guests to see their own backgrounds and traditions reflected in the stories, experiences and products they encounter in their interactions with Disney," D'Amaro said. "And we want our cast members – and future cast members – to feel a sense of belonging at work." This means offering more inclusive products like costumes for people in wheelchairs and LGBTQ Mickey ears, as well as revamping attractions in the parks to feature more diversity. Disney has already begun to reimagine several attractions, including its Jungle Cruise ride, and is transitioning Splash Mountain into a new adventure ride featuring Princess Tiana and other characters from "The Princess and the Frog." Another key piece of that strategy is allowing cast members to better express their personality while working in the parks. Disney has always had a strict policy for how its parks employees must dress and present themselves while in public. This included gender-specific rules for how men and women can wear their hair and style facial hair as well as restricting what types of jewelry could be worn and requiring that tattoos remain covered at all times. Now, there will no longer be segmented rules for male and female workers. D'Amaro explained that all cast members will follow the same guidelines, which feature gender-inclusive hairstyles, jewelry and nail styles. Cast members will still need to abide by some of the previous rules, like keeping hair natural colors and making sure their name tag is never covered. "The world is changing, and we will change with it," he said. Costuming, too, will be more gender inclusive. Cast members will no longer have to choose between a male and female look based on what part of the park they work in. They will now have a wider range of costume options. It will be more in line with how cast members in the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge land are able to mix and match different clothing pieces to create their own personal look. "Changes like these are strategic: we see in study after study that the next generation of Disney fans and guests rejects gender stereotypes and craves values alignment with brands," said Erin Uritus, CEO of Out & Equal, an organization that works toward LGBTQ workplace equality, in a statement. "Simply put, they want the companies they patronize to be as inclusive and forward-looking as they are. This is a great moment for people everywhere to see Disney – an iconic company – signal that everyone is welcome there." "With these changes, cast members can bring their full, authentic selves to their work," she said. "More Disney guests will be able to see themselves reflected in the diversity of people across all levels of the company." Disneyland is slated to reopen on April 30 at limited capacity for California residents. Disney's Orlando-based parks and parks in Hong Kong and Shanghai have reopened to the public, while Disneyland Paris has remained closed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Amazon said Wednesday it will examine its performance review systems and attrition rates for "any statistically significant demographic differences," as part of its diversity, equity and inclusion goals for 2021. It comes as Amazon has faced scrutiny over its hiring and promotion practices, including allegations of racial discrimination.	Amazon  said Wednesday it will examine how it conducts employee performance reviews, a process that has faced allegations of racial bias, as part of its 2021 diversity, equity and inclusion goals. In a memo sent to employees and posted on the company's web site, Amazon's HR boss, Beth Galetti, said the company would look for any "statistically significant demographic differences" in performance ratings conducted in the first quarter of this year to identify any problems and take action where necessary. Amazon will also perform a similar evaluation of its attrition rates and "low performance actions" to identify any gaps. Along those lines, Galetti said Amazon hopes to retain employees at statistically similar rates across all demographics as part of its goals for this year. The decision comes as Amazon faces growing scrutiny over its hiring and promotion practices. Recode reported in February that Black Amazon employees are promoted less often and endure harsher evaluations than their non-Black colleagues, citing interviews and internal data. Additionally, in March, an Amazon Web Services senior manager sued Amazon for allegedly discriminating against Black and female employees at its corporate offices. Charlotte Newman also claimed Amazon paid her less than similarly qualified White coworkers. Newman said she endured racial and sexual harassment by her coworkers and supervisors, including being told that she looked "like a gorilla," according to the complaint. An Amazon spokesperson said the company investigated the claims and fired Newman's harasser. Amazon also issued additional training requirements for those in Newman's reporting line, the spokesperson said. "We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind," the spokesperson said. "We are currently investigating the new allegations included in the lawsuit." Galetti said Amazon would work to further diversify its leadership this year. The company aims to double the number of Black employees in leadership roles and hire 30% more Black people and female employees in "L4-L7" roles, which range from entry level to senior manager positions, in the U.S. this year. "It is going to take time and consistent focus to get where we want to be," Galetti said, adding that members of CEO Jeff Bezos' S-Team, a group of over a dozen senior executives from all areas of Amazon's business, have been meeting biweekly since June of last year to "scrutinize our progress toward reaching these goals." Galetti said Amazon achieved several diversity goals established in 2020, including doubling the representation of Black directors and vice presidents at the company. Last year, women made up 22.8% of Amazon's senior leadership in the U.S., while Black employees represented just 3.8% of its U.S. senior leadership, according to Amazon's latest workforce data .
Mastercard announced a multimillion dollar investment in the venture capital Fearless Fund and a debit card partnership with new fintech firm Greenwood. Fearless Fund co-founder Arian Simone said "the sky's the limit" when women of color get access to funding to help them start their businesses. "It's encouraging to know that Mastercard is aligned with our mission of economic empowerment for people of color," said Greenwood co-founder and chairman Ryan Glover.	Mastercard announced Tuesday a multimillion dollar investment in Fearless Fund, a venture capital firm founded by Black women with the mission of investing in minority female entrepreneurs. The exact amount was not disclosed. The credit card giant also unveiled a partnership with Greenwood, a fintech firm aimed at Black and Latino consumers and business owners, to issue the platform's first debit cards. "This is part of our broader work on financial inclusion," Mastercard president of strategic growth Michael Froman told CNBC. "We want to bring all the assets of the company to the table, to engage with them, help them succeed, help them get to scale." Fearless Fund looks to provide early financing to companies started by women of color in the technology, consumer packaged goods, food, fashion and beauty industries. Other investors in Fearless Fund include PayPal , Bank of America and Costco . The three co-founders of Fearless Fund are chief development officer Keshia Knight-Pulliam, who played Rudy Huxtable on the "Cosby Show;" CEO Arian Simone, an entrepreneur and best-selling author; and COO Ayana Parsons, a veteran consultant. Simone told CNBC the Mastercard investment has the potential to be a game changer for the companies in the fund's portfolio. "This deal also marks a major milestone for our brand," she said. "When women of color are provided with the necessary resources and funding to launch their businesses, the sky's the limit." Women of color are "notoriously underfunded," Simone said, adding that they don't typically rely on big institutional investments when creating their business plans. "They are prepared to bootstrap and [are] in the mindset that they will need to be the primary driving force behind their ideas," she added. Black and Latino female founders have received less than 1% of venture capital funding, according to a 2020 report from Digital Undivided . "When a company such as Mastercard provides this level of funding to propel women of color founders, it takes everything that these women are already doing and maximizes it to a degree that will allow them to shake any industry they enter," Simone said. Last September, the credit card giant made a $500 million commitment to support Black communities and help close the racial wealth and opportunity gap over the next five years. "There are a lot of changes happening in the VC world, with all the announcements and commitments being made by big corporations to invest in diverse fund managers, but we will have to see if all are truly executing and operationalizing based on their statements," Simone said. "Mastercard is following through on its commitment, but we must make sure everyone is making a systemic change rather than following a trend. What I'm really hoping to see from investors is a larger focus on inclusion." Greenwood will issue two Mastercard-backed debit cards that offer features like identity theft protection, credit monitoring and airport concierge service. The service was co-founded by civil rights leader Andrew Young, rapper-activist Michael "Killer Mike" Render and Ryan Glover, founder of the Bounce TV Network. "It's encouraging to know that Mastercard is aligned with our mission of economic empowerment for people of color," said Glover, chairman of Greenwood. The alliance also provides "Greenwood customers will get a best-in-class product and the tools to grow wealth," he added. Mastercard and Greenwood are also partnering on a financial podcast and other educational content on banking, financial planning, home ownership and wealth creation designed to engage the Black and Latino communities. Greenwood, which launched last October, already has a waitlist of more than 500,000 people. The Greenwood Debit Mastercard is expected to be available later this year.
Some of the country's top CEOs and business leaders shared their reactions to the Derek Chauvin verdict on Twitter and Facebook and in letters to employees. Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was found guilty on all three charges in the murder of George Floyd. Last spring, Black Lives Matter protests pushed companies to make their own pledges to advance racial equity and support police reform.	In tweets, corporate statements and letters to their employees, some of the nation's top business leaders are expressing relief at the guilty verdict in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the murder of George Floyd. They are also calling for the country to continue to fight against systemic racism and for police reform. Chauvin was found guilty of all three charges , including second-degree murder and third-degree murder, on Tuesday. Last spring, Floyd's murder catalyzed Black Lives Matter protests across the country and the globe. A video taken by a teenage bystander, Darnella Frazier, outside of a Minneapolis convenience store, showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for about nine minutes. In Floyd's final moments, he struggled to breathe and called out for his mother. As protestors marched in the streets, companies faced scrutiny for their own records on racial equity. They were pushed to do more than simply put out statements — prompting a series of corporate commitments from overhauling how companies recruit and hire Black employees to backing mandatory deescalation training for police. Here is a round-up of reactions to the Chauvin verdict by business leaders and companies, in alphabetical order: "There are countless examples of violence against Black men and women that don't end this way. In the past year, a number of brutal and senseless murders of Black Americans – from Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor to Daunte Wright and many others – remind us of the stark reality and persistence of systemic racism in our country. They sparked anger, awareness and dialogue; but not the change needed to address injustice in our communities and institutions. As an airline, we bring people of all races, ethnicities and backgrounds together every day." "We believe Black lives matter. We know there is more work to do to achieve racial justice and equity in our society, and we remain committed to the journey." — Excerpts from a letter sent to employees Tuesday night by American Airlines executives, CEO Doug Parker, President Robert Isom and  Cedric Rockamore, vice president of global people operations and diversity and inclusion — Tim Cook, Apple CEO, said on his personal Twitter account "While this verdict in the murder of George Floyd symbolizes some measure of progress toward racial equity and accountability, it does not fully erase our nation's history of systemic and institutional racism. We still have a long way to go in our fight for racial justice in this country, and Best Buy's unwavering commitment to this work is as strong as ever." — Statement from Best Buy "Today's verdict confirms that George Floyd was the victim of a senseless crime. Though today's verdict is a step toward justice in this case, unarmed Black men and women continue to die in encounters with the police. To ensure true justice and healing, our country needs to take steps to address its long history of racial inequity in law enforcement. Business Roundtable will continue to work with Members of Congress and the Administration on bipartisan policing reforms that implement national policing standards, and greater accountability, training, community engagement and transparency." — Statement by group of CEOs, which is led by its chairman, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon — Chuck Robbins, Cisco CEO, said on his personal Twitter account "George Floyd's murder almost one year ago sparked a much needed reckoning on racism in America. It rightly pushed us as individuals and as a company to examine what we can and should do — what we must do — to take action to create a more equitable society. The verdict in the trial today sparks a great deal of emotion for many of us. It feels like justice has been finally served, yet it doesn't end the grief felt by so many. It underscores the EMT's [executive management team's] commitment — shared by so many of you — to be allies, to fight systemic racism at every level, and to support all those facing injustice. It also speaks to the importance of the work we're doing through our Action for Racial Equity commitment to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the U.S." — Excerpts from a LinkedIn post by Sara Wechter, Citigroup 's head of human resources "Right now I'm thinking of George Floyd, his family and those who knew him. I hope this verdict brings some measure of comfort to them, and to everyone who can't help but see themselves in his story. We stand in solidarity with you, knowing that this is part of a bigger struggle against racism and injustice." — Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of Facebook , said in a post on the social media site "A small measure of justice was done today. But real justice would be for George Floyd to be alive and in the arms of his family. This brutal tragedy is one page in the much larger story of systemic racism, oppression, and injustice in our country. As we continue to regularly witness unarmed Black people in America killed by police, I stand with those demanding change. We can't un-see what Derek Chauvin did to George Floyd. We can't un-know the truth it exposed about racism in America today. And we can't — mustn't — ever forget. There can be no true justice in America until liberty and equality are real for everyone. My thoughts are with George Floyd's family today, and with so many other families who are missing their loved ones today." — Sheryl Sandberg,  chief operating officer of Facebook, said in a post on the social media site "We are hopeful today's verdict will allow a grieving family and a community to start to heal. However, the systemic racism and social injustice apparent in the killing of George Floyd and countless other terrible episodes in our country are deeply rooted. Together, we must remain thoughtful and determined in addressing this reality, including the unacceptable abuse of authority and power and the pain it causes – disproportionately for the Black community and other people of color. For our part, Ford and our UAW partners will continue to create a company culture where everyone feels they belong and our differences are truly valued." — Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford , and Jim Farley, CEO, said in a statement  — Mary Barra, General Motors CEO, said on her personal Twitter account — Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO, said on his personal Twitter account, echoing the company's support of congressional action on police reform and advocacy for the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act "Justice was served, it's the beginning of a long path to fix some of these things." "We haven't solved this racial inequality problem for hundreds of years, and in fact in some decades it's gone backwards." — Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase CEO, said Wednesday at a company event — Marc Benioff, founder and CEO of Salesforce and owner of Time, quoting from a story by Time journalist Janell Ross "Today's verdict is a verdict against bias, against injustice; an important milepost on our collective journey. As communities, as leaders and as businesses, we must all continue to be part of the solution to shift our society, take a stand against racism and violence, and act as a catalyst of change." — Mike Manley, Stellantis head of the Americas, said in a statement "The murder of George Floyd last Memorial Day felt like a turning point for our country. The solidarity and stand against racism since then have been unlike anything I've experienced. Like outraged people everywhere, I had an overwhelming hope that today's verdict would provide real accountability. Anything short of that would have shaken my faith that our country had truly turned a corner. Today's guilty verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial is another sign of forward progress. As I think about the Minneapolis Police Department denouncing the brutality George Floyd faced, and the disgrace expressed by multiple witnesses, the jury's verdict reassures me that we will not go backward. Sadly, this kind of tragedy did not end last May 25, and our country has a lot of work to do and a long way to go. I can't imagine how difficult these months have been for the family and friends of George Floyd. They are very much in my thoughts, and I hope today's verdict offers some measure of solace. I am also thinking about our Black team members in particular. I know this trial cannot erase the pain that comes from years of inequalities and inequities. What I want to offer today is my promise that we as a company will continue to use our values and actions to advance empathy and understanding and to confront individual bias and systemic racism. Today's verdict does not mean that our work is done. There's much more to do as we support healing in our hometown of Minneapolis and across the country. We have to keep moving forward, together, toward a safe and equitable future for all." — Letter sent to employees Tuesday night by Target CEO Brian Cornell — Jeff Lawson, co-founder and CEO of Twilio , said on his personal Twitter account — Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber CEO, said on his personal Twitter account "This has been an especially painful time in our nation, particularly for Black and African Americans and communities of color. We hope today's verdict is an initial step towards justice and healing. Wells Fargo is committed to fostering a culture that supports diversity, equity and inclusion, both within our company and the communities we serve.  As we move forward, we are working to create meaningful change and will continue supporting our employees, partners and investing in our communities because it's our responsibility as a corporate citizen and the right thing to do." — Statement shared by a Wells Fargo spokesperson — Eric Yuan, Zoom co-founder and CEO, said on his personal Twitter account, which included a copy of a letter sent to employees — CNBC's Leslie Josephs , Phil LeBeau , Ari Levy , Hugh Son, Michael Wayland and Sarah Whitten contributed to this report.
"The environment is shifting around us and we need to be consumer led in everything we do," Beam Suntory CEO Albert Baladi told CNBC. As part of those initiatives, Beam Suntory will spend $500 million globally to educate consumers on responsible drinking. Sustainability, diversity and responsible drinking plans are a growing trend in the alcohol business.	Alcohol company Beam Suntory announced Wednesday a $1 billion investment in new sustainability, diversity and responsible drinking initiatives. As part of those plans, the producer of the Jim Beam and Maker's Mark whiskey brands, pledged to reduce by half its water usage and greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. "The environment is shifting around us and we need to be consumer led in everything we do," Beam Suntory CEO Albert Baladi told CNBC. "The planet urgently needs it. Our consumers and stakeholders are expecting it. So, the time is right for us to climb the ladder of commitment as we say and get going on those bold ambitions." Beam Suntory, which also is behind the Effen vodka and Cruzan rum brands, is also setting goals of 50% of leadership positions being filled by women globally, and aiming for minorities to make up 45% of its U.S. workforce by 2030. Beam Suntory will spend $500 million globally to educate consumers on responsible drinking and reduce harmful drinking with the goal of engaging 300 million people globally by 2030. Sustainability, diversity and responsible drinking plans are a growing trend in the alcohol business, partially due to a rise in investors who care about environmental, social and governance issues, also known as ESG. Beam Suntory is a private company and not necessarily beholden to ESG concerns, but the CEO believes the $1 billion commitment will make the brands more attractive to key demographics. "We believe that diverse companies are better companies, they innovate, they are more competitive they succeed better in the market," Baladi said, "Consumers are resonating to this for sure, particularly the younger consumers. Gen-Zs and the millennials are responding very favorably to those plans." Beam Suntory — a subsidiary of Suntory Holdings Ltd. of Japan, based in Chicago — reported U.S. sales growth of 4% in 2020. Baladi expects to see continued growth, but said the alcohol business remains "uncertain" during the Covid pandemic .
Walmart said it has rising representation of women and people of color in officer roles, as it takes steps to better reflect the country's diversity. The retail giant is the top employer in the U.S. with a workforce of 1.53 million. It gave a progress update on its diversity and inclusion efforts in a report published on Monday.	Walmart said Monday that it has rising representation of women and people of color in officer roles — a sign that the company says reflects steps it is taking to better reflect the country's diversity among its top leadership. The big-box retailer is the largest U.S. employer with a workforce of about 1.53 million people. It published its annual diversity and inclusion report on Monday. Nearly 75% of Walmart employees in officer roles are white. About 25% of those roles are held by people of color — including 8.42% held by Black or African-American employees, as of Jan. 31, 2021. The officer level is the highest level of the company and includes positions of vice president and above. Nearly 24% of the U.S. population identifies as a race or origin that is not white, according to the U.S. Census Bureau . More than 13% of the U.S. population is Black or African-American. Walmart's representation of women and of people of color at the officer level rose 1.03% and 0.61%, respectively, over the past year, according to the report. The increase in people of color was driven by a nearly 2% increase in Black and African American officers, the company said. Walmart, like other companies across corporate America, has faced heightened pressure to show that it is advancing racial equity with how it hires, promotes and does business — particularly after the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd illuminated how sharp disparities in health care access, financial opportunity and treatment by police can be deadly. The retailer made several diversity-related commitments in the wake of the George Floyd protests. Among them, the company said it would focus on making its own workforce more diverse, give progress updates twice a year and contribute $100 million over five years to help fight systemic racism. Walmart and its foundation gave the first round of grants in February. Walmart's Chief Culture, Diversity and Inclusion Officer Ben-Saba Hasan said in an interview that the company has focused on hiring and promoting women and people of color by enlisting support across the board, rather than having efforts largely begin and end in his department. Of Walmart's total new hires in 2020, people of color made up 55% and women represented just shy of 50%, he said. Hasan said he has gotten about 40 or 50 calls from chief diversity officers over the past 14 months — a noticeably higher volume than in the past. He said many of those executives are stepping into a brand-new role created by their companies. And, he said he has noticed more energy devoted to the effort at Walmart compared with his nearly 13 prior years at the company. "As I think back about the past year sitting in this job, I feel what is almost this unthinkable set of challenges that has forced our nation to look directly in the face of social systems that have created inequities for many of us," he said. "And I think people are seeing it through a different eye."
"Voting rights without access to capital to build wealth is, in my opinion, an empty cup," BET founder Robert Johnson told CNBC on Tuesday. Johnson said he hopes corporate America supports efforts to help Black Americans gain access to capital with same vigor as protecting ballot access. "If you believe that voting rights is a primary need of the Black community, I would argue that access to capital is equal to or more so," Johnson said.	BET founder Robert Johnson told CNBC on Tuesday he hopes corporate America will support efforts that boost Black Americans' access to capital with the same vigor as many companies recently did around voting access . Johnson's comments on "Squawk Box" came one day after the entrepreneur went public with a proposal that would give preferential tax treatment to capital gains on investments made in minority-owned businesses. He called on politicians in Washington to consider his idea, which he said would incentivize investment in businesses that have historically lacked it. "If you believe that voting rights is a primary need of the Black community, I would argue that access to capital is equal to or more so," Johnson said. "Voting rights without access to capital to build wealth is, in my opinion, an empty cup." Johnson, who founded Black Entertainment Television in 1980, has been vocal about the role companies can play in addressing racial inequality in the U.S., particularly around changing hiring practices . While saying he does support the protection of voting rights for Black Americans, Johnson said it's also key to ensure it can lead to policies being enacted that meaningfully improve economic opportunity. The founder and chairman of investment firm RLJ Companies has criticized Democrats and Republicans alike for not doing enough to address enduring inequities for Black Americans, even suggesting last year that Black Americans form their own political party . "It's a glass half empty if you're saying, 'I'm going to give you the right to vote, but that vote doesn't translate into you being able to build wealth for your family; send your kids off to college; provide retirement savings for you; to become a part of the economic system in the country as you deserve, giving you equal opportunity,'" Johnson said Tuesday. Johnson said his message to business leaders who criticized the recent election reform law in Georgia and publicized broad support for voting rights is: "Take the same attitude toward capital." "This is, after all, the capitalistic, free market economy," said Johnson, who became America's first Black billionaire in 2001 when BET's holding company was acquired by Viacom . "Access to capital and access to wealth ... is what Black Americans need now more than ever," Johnson added. He is no longer on the Forbes billionaires list . A number of companies announced commitments to addressing racial inequality in the U.S. last year after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked renewed attention to the long-standing economic disparities. Some of the nation's largest banks — such as JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America and Citigroup — have committed capital to initiatives focused on reducing inequality. Goldman Sachs announced last month a $10 billion program to advance economic opportunity for Black women. Johnson also weighed in on the possibility of higher taxes on corporations and capital gains for wealthy Americans as part of various legislative proposals from the Biden administration. "It comes down to, how do you use the tax code to increase ... economic growth overall?" Johnson added, saying that raising taxes on companies "in a blanket fashion is not, in my opinion, the best way."
The labor force participation rate for women in Saudi Arabia increased from 20% to 33% in two years, according to the Brookings Institution. Women of all ages and varying education levels are joining the workforce at higher rates, but the report picked out two groups that saw the largest increases — Saudi women between the age of 40 and 54, and those with secondary education. However, non-profit organization Human Rights Watch says Saudi Arabia still has a long way to go, with women's rights activists still in detention.	The number of Saudi women in the workforce has risen sharply in recent years, according to Brookings Institution. In late 2018, around 20% of adult women held jobs or were actively looking for one. By the end of 2020, the female labor force participation rate stood at about 33%. "That is to say that the share of Saudi women in the labor market expanded by an incredible 64 percent in just two years!" Brookings said in a blog post last week . The authors of the post said there were no clear reasons for the "dramatic change" in Saudi Arabia, but that "one should not underestimate the potential impact of the many reforms that made it easier for women to work over the last few years." Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has spearheaded initiatives to change economic and societal rules as part of his Vision 2030 plan to diversify the country's economy. One of the program's aims is to increase women's participation in the workforce to 30%, a goal that has now been achieved. The ultra-conservative country lifted a long-standing driving ban for women in 2018, and the government ended gender segregation in restaurants in December 2019. Brookings also pointed to changes in laws on guardianship, labor and family. Before recent reforms, women were not allowed to travel out of Saudi Arabia without a male guardian, and could be fired for pregnancy in some cases. "It seems that these reforms are starting to pay off," the authors said. Women of all ages and varying education levels are joining the workforce at higher rates, but the report picked out two groups that saw the largest increases: Saudi women between the ages of 40 and 54, and those with secondary education. There was an increase of more than 20 percentage points among women between 40 and 54 years of age. Meanwhile, 25% of women with secondary education are now in the labor force — up from 9% previously. The Brookings blog post said that the inflow of Saudi women into the workforce did not result in more unemployment. "What we observe in Saudi Arabia, is that many of these women joining the labor market are finding work quickly," said the authors Sofia Gomez Tamayo, Johannes Koettl, and Nayib Rivera. The employment rate of women has grown from 68% to 76% over those two years despite new entrants, they said. "Maybe even more importantly, this increase in employment was not driven by the government hiring Saudi women," Brookings said. "It was genuine private-sector-led employment growth." Public sector employment of Saudi women increased by 5% from the start of 2019 to the end of 2020. In the private sector, female employment in the accommodation and food industries grew by 40%. The construction and manufacturing sectors saw more modest growth of 9% and 14%, respectively. The wholesale and retail trade hired 5% more women, the report said. While Saudi Arabia has implemented gender reforms in recent years, rights groups say women and girls still face discrimination. In a February news release, Human Rights Watch noted that some prominent women's rights activists are still in detention and called recent reforms "incomplete." "Saudi women still require a male guardian's approval to marry, be released from prison or obtain certain sexual or reproductive health care," the report said. In its 2020 report , Amnesty International pointed to similar shortcomings. "Women and girls continued to face discrimination in law and practice in relation to marriage, divorce and inheritance, and remained inadequately protected from sexual and other forms of violence," the rights group said.
Helping minority-owned small businesses recover from Covid is the goal of American Express' $40 million investment in the Accion Opportunity Fund. The loans, which started going out this week, range from $5,000 to $100,000, depending on business need. "Our intention is to look at underfunded small businesses that are really looking to get stronger, to reopen, to stabilize," Accion's Luz Urrutia told CNBC.	Helping small businesses owned by people of color, immigrants and women recover from the Covid pandemic is the goal of a $40 million investment American Express is making with Accion Opportunity Fund. The loans, which started going out this week, range from $5,000 to $100,000, depending on business need. The average is expected to be around $28,000 according to forecasts from the nonprofit fund, which aims to help build a financially inclusive world. "Our intention is to look at underfunded small businesses that are really looking to get stronger, to reopen, to stabilize and grow in 2021 and beyond," Luz Urrutia, CEO of the Accion Opportunity Fund, told CNBC. "[Businesses] we know are trying to invest, buy inventory, perhaps pivot and they need reasonable terms and credit to get back on their feet." To qualify for the loans with 12 to 60 month terms, an applicant must be in business for 12 months, have proof of $50,000 in revenue per year and own at least 20% of the business. Applicants with low FICO credit scores will be considered, but their credit rating will be a factor in determining the loan's interest rate, which can range from 5.99% to 25.99%. Underfunded small business owners often use cash advances or other products from "alternative" lenders with an average interest rate of 94%, according to Accion research. "We specialize, particularly in businesses that don't have the traditional documentation that don't fit nicely into traditional credit boxes of much larger lenders like American Express," said Urrutia, who spent her career in lending, including 18 years at Wachovia Bank before it was acquired by Wells Fargo . "FICO for us is a data point, but if a customer doesn't have a FICO score. It's OK. We will still loan if they meet other criteria. That takes specialized lending. A lot of the traditional mainstream lenders really don't have the capacity," she said. Black-owned businesses will be a focus on the Accion loan program. Last fall, American Express announced a $1 billion plan, which included a pledge to provide capital and financial education to 250,000 Black small businesses and provide $25,000 grants to Black female entrepreneurs in partnership with nonprofit IFundWomen. "When we look at the outsized impact of the pandemic, combined with systemic racism, we know that Black- owned businesses have been at a historic disadvantage," American Express executive Jessica Ling told CNBC. "This has refueled a commitment from American Express to help support the Black business community by offering access to funding, giving resources ... to help them grow." Accion predicts the $40 million investment through the cycles of loaning money, repayment and lending again will turn into $125 million in loans over the next five years and allow small business owners to create or retain 10,000 jobs. "Our ethos is really to provide a hand up, not a handout," said Urrutia. "The sustainability and the value of our model really relies on making loans to businesses that they pay back, and we take those funds and we lend them to other businesses. It's a virtuous circle." Philanthropist Mackenzie Scott, ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave Accion a $15 million grantin August.
The Boston Celtics could miss the NBA's postseason for the first time since 2014, costing new jersey patch partner Vistaprint increased brand exposure. Vistaprint took over the Celtics patch slot in November 2020, after General Eclectic vacated the partnership. Vistaprint pays in the range of $10 to $15 million per year for the Celtics jersey patch.	Design and marketing company Vistaprint made its first significant investment in pro sports in 2020, and now one of the most iconic National Basketball Association franchises need to fulfill its part. The Boston Celtics have struggled lately, falling to clubs including the draft lottery-bound Oklahoma City Thunder, the Chicago Bulls and the Miami Heat. And on Monday, the Celtics suffered another loss after announcing star forward Jaylen Brown would miss the remainder of the season due to a left wrist injury. At 35-33, the team is sitting seventh in the Eastern Conference and now on the verge of losing its seventh consecutive playoff berth as the NBA enters the final week of the regular season. This season, the NBA mandated seeds seven through 10 participate in play-in games to determine postseason placement. The games pair the lower seeds to pick the final two playoff spots. If the Celtics remain seventh and lose two play-in games, the club will miss the playoffs for the first time since the 2013-14 season. In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Ricky Engelberg, Vistaprint's chief marketing officer, said he's "optimistic" that won't be the case, though. "The Celtics are always going to be the Celtics," Engelberg said. "It would be amazing if they went on a multi-year run with multiple championships and deep playoff runs. But the Celtics are the Celtics and one of the most iconic sports franchises in the world." The NBA generated roughly $150 million in revenue from its patch program, which was introduced for the 2017-18 season. The program lets companies pay to put their logo on a patch on the shoulder of each player's jersey. Companies who purchase an NBA team patch covet the brand awareness obtained when teams play national games on ESPN or TNT, the league's top media partners. So, when a club makes the postseason, it helps the patch increase in value. Hence, if the Celtics miss the playoffs, their jersey patch partnership with Vistaprint takes a hit, as the company loses the increased brand exposure. Vistaprint used agency Excel Sports to strike a deal with the Celtics in November 2020, taking over the jersey patch slot from General Electric . Due to a non-disclose agreement in place, financial details of the pact weren't provided, but it's estimated Vistaprint is paying in the range of $10 to $15 million per year for the rights, according to industry insiders. GE paid roughly $7 million per year in its deal with the Celtics. Like most patch deals, this agreement includes Vistaprint signage at TD Garden, the Celtics home arena, and brand showings across the team's G League and esports team. Engelberg, a former Nike executive, said the decision to enter the partnership was partly due to the Celtics' status in pro sports. But the reach of the team's patch probably factored in, too. According to Sports Business Journal , the GE patch on Celtics jerseys was one of the more recognizable patches among NBA clubs. "They've earned so much equity as a franchise over the years," Engelberg said. "But as important as the postseason is, finding a franchise where every game matters was just as important." Owned by Ireland-based customization company Cimpress , Vistaprint specializes in creating logos, campaign banners, and website designs for smaller companies. On its website, the company says it does over $1.4 billion in annual revenue. Engelberg said one of the initiatives included in the deal with the Celtics is building more exposure for small business clients in the Boston area, so Vistaprint grants part of its in-arena signage inventory to companies for games that are not televised nationally. "Our inventory is their inventory. Our partnership is their partnership," Engelberg said. "It's not just about logo placement. But from a 360 standpoint, how we could partner together where it's us, the Celtics, and small businesses to create this truly unique moment to shine a spotlight on the core customer that we partner with so much." Last week, the company also activated another campaign aimed to help Black businesses. It paired with Celtics guard Kemba Walker to auction a signed Panini trading card and autograph game-worn sneakers from Sunday's 130-124 loss to the Heat. The auction concludes Wednesday, and all profits will be donated to a grant program that grants $25,000 to Black businesses in Boston. The Celtics and Vistaprint committed $1 million to the program, and Walker will donate his undisclosed partnership fee, too. "It's great to have someone like Kemba that wants to be able to share his spotlight with people throughout the community," said Engelberg, reiterating the company is more focused on the long view of the Celtics patch deal. "Almost one season in with the Celtics, we're excited for how this year has gone. And we have just as many exciting things for the future that we want to try and make happen," Engelberg said. Cimpress has a market capitalization of $2.5 billion. Its stock trades on the Nasdaq and was down 3% on Monday, closing at $98.39 per share. This story was updated to reflect Jaylen Brown's injury.
Finalists for the NBA social justice champion will donate a combined $200,000 to social justice organizations of their choice, with the winner's organization receiving $100,000.	The National Basketball Association announced the social justice champion award, naming it after Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The league will select a player after each season, honoring the individual who demonstrates a commitment to bringing awareness to social justice and inequalities. NBA clubs will nominate one player for the award, and finalists of the group will donate a combined $200,000 to social justice organizations. The finalists will be selected by a committee that includes former NBA players, league executives and social justice leaders. The league said it would announce the first recipient during its postseason, which starts next week. "I'm honored and grateful to be associated with this award that will recognize the dedicated and selfless people fighting to promote social justice for all marginalized people," said Abdul-Jabbar in a statement. "To me, it's another giant step in the right direction for the country and all people who value equality." A six-time NBA champion and former Los Angeles Lakers great, Abdul-Jabbar, 74, is a long-time social justice advocate. Over the last year, he's joined CNBC to discuss inequality in the Black community, calling for more education and financial resources. "Black Americans are often the last hired and the first fired; we can change that," Abdul-Jabbar told CNBC's "Closing Bell" last June. "There's a lot of positive ways we can relate to our fellow citizens and work on this problem and eliminate it." The NBA has increased its attention to social justice, and inequality matters over the last year following the death of George Floyd. The league committed $300 million to assist underserved areas and combat income inequality among Black people. The league distributed another installment of the grants to social organizations last month. "In addition to being one of our greatest players, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has devoted much of his life to advocating for equality and social justice," NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. "With this new award, we are proud to recognize and celebrate NBA players who are using their influence to make an impact on their communities and our broader society." The NBA's 2020-21 regular season ends this weekend, with play-in games to start next week to determine the final four teams who will make the playoffs. The league played a shortened 72-game schedule due to the pandemic.
The Peacock series "Rutherford Falls" has a staff of 10 writers, five of whom are Indigenous. The show currently holds a 94% "Fresh" rating from Rotten Tomatoes from 32 reviews, and fans of the series are already clamoring for a second season. "It is actually a financially viable decision to bring new voices into the industry," said writer and actress Jana Schmieding. "We have more nuanced storytelling, we have more engaged viewers and we have more literate viewers."	When audiences first meet Terry Thomas, the manager of Running Thunder Casino on Peacock's "Rutherford Falls," they see a stoic, intense Native man with a commanding presence. The character is set up to be the villain, or, at least, that's how it seems. As each 30-minute installment of the 10-episode season unfolds, viewers meet the real Terry — a loving father with a knack for entrepreneurship and a devotion to his community. He is calculating and cunning, but also sincere, honorable and, at times, quite funny. Episode four of the series, entitled "Terry Thomas," was a particularly emotional experience for actor Michael Greyeyes. "Very often people who are businessmen, casino owners or bosses are corrupt and greedy people," he said. "With episode four [Sierra Teller Ornelas] and the other writers obliterate that stereotype." For Hollywood, diversity and inclusion have become a hot-button issue. In the last few years, the traditionally white industry has begun to institute official initiatives to foster a culture of inclusivity. While some of these goals were created due to public outcry, studios quickly discovered that having these unique and different voices was good for business. Films with women or people of color at the center have proven successful at the box office, bringing in billions of dollars to studios in the last five years. Blockbuster features like "Captain Marvel," "Wonder Woman," "Crazy Rich Asians" and "Black Panther" have shown that audiences will turn out for quality films with diverse characters. For streamers like Peacock, who derive revenue from subscribers and advertising, the payoff is a little different. The shows that gain traction with audiences can result in higher subscription rates or convince a subscriber who was thinking of leaving the service to stay around for another month or two. "Rutherford Falls" is an anomaly in the industry, although its writers and actors hope that changes. The show has a staff of 10 writers, five of whom are Indigenous. The team is led by Michael Schur — one of the most prolific sitcom creators in the industry, whose credits include "The Office," "The Good Place" and "Parks and Recreation" — and Ornelas, the first Native content creator to helm a television comedy. On Peacock, which has 42 million sign-ups for its service, the Native creators are able to share their stories with a wide audience — and their authentic voices are already being rewarded. The show currently holds a 94% "Fresh" rating from Rotten Tomatoes from 32 reviews, and fans of the series are already clamoring for a second season. "We are starting to see a shift, especially with the Hollywood Foreign Press and such, we are starting to see some real and actual systemic challenges taking place right now," said Jana Schmieding, who works in the writers room for "Rutherford Falls" and as well as stars in the series. "It is actually a financially viable decision to bring new voices into the industry," she said. "We have more nuanced storytelling, we have more engaged viewers and we have more literate viewers." This is Schmieding's first gig as a writer on a TV series and her breakout role as an actress. While she has been widely praised for her role as Reagan Wells in the series, it was a part that she had not initially planned on playing. After a decade as a public school teacher in New York City, where she spent her nights performing sketch and improv comedy, Schmieding finally made the move to Los Angeles in 2016. For the better part of three years, the Lakota Sioux writer and actress tried to get a staff position. After striking up a friendship with Ornelas, Schmieding was finally offered a seat at the table. "It took a Native woman to see me and to see my talent and to lift me up and hire me," she said. The table was "Rutherford Falls," a show about two lifelong best friends, Nathan Rutherford (Ed Helms) and Reagan Wells (Schmieding), who find themselves at a crossroads when the town calls for the removal of a historic statue that honors Nathan's family lineage. Both the town and the Native tribe are fictional, but are brought to life through the real experiences of the show's writing staff. The statue, known as "Big Larry," commemorates the deal Lawrence Rutherford, an American settler, made with the Minishonka tribe to create the town of Rutherford Falls. Through a series of missteps, Nathan accidentally opens the door for one of the leaders of the Minishonka tribe, Terry Thomas, to sue him and a multimillion-dollar corporation that was established by the Rutherford family for years of unpaid remunerations. The ordeal puts a strain on the relationship between Reagan and Nathan, as Reagan must choose between standing with her longtime friend or siding with her Indigenous community. "What some people may not realize is that there is a tremendous amount of pressure on such a sitcom," wrote Vincent Schilling, an Akwesasne Mohawk and associate editor and senior correspondent at Indian Country Today. "If it isn't funny, or flounders in any way, Native people may not get a chance for a long, long time because the execs that be in the TV networks may just assert that Native content isn't going to sell." Ornelas, Schur and Helms, who co-created the series together, balance the weightiness of the tension between the Minishonka and Nathan with light comedic moments. The satire of watching a white man fight for his history (and land) against a group of people who have long been subjugated under similar circumstances brings surprising levity to the show. "As a Native journalist, this is exceptional," Schilling wrote in his review of the series. "The writing is exactly what I have wanted to see for decades, actually my entire life." That sentiment was shared by Greyeyes, a Plains Cree from the Muskeg Lake First Nation in Canada. The Native actor has three decades of experience in the entertainment industry and it's only in the last five that he's seen a real shift in the portrayal of Native characters in film and on television. Throughout his career he said he's seen "the good, the bad and the ugly" when it comes to Indigenous representation in media. "What I saw in Hollywood for a very long time was that they were just willing to look at the Indigenous person as a metaphor or as a foil for something else where white characters would learn something from us or they would come to their own emotional realization due to our presence in the story," Greyeyes said. "Or even worse, they would just extract from our cultures, from our stories, from our history and use it for whatever purposes that they needed." "What I've seen change is the notion that Indigenous people are not siloed, that we are everywhere," he said. For those that study Native culture and representation in media, the largest shift in the portrayal of Indigenous people in film and on television has come in the wake of the Standing Rock protests. In 2016, the Dakota Access Pipeline was rerouted near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Members of the tribe opposed the pipeline because it would disturb the upper Missouri River, the only water supply for the reservation. While protests started that year, it wasn't until mid-2017 that the media began to latch onto the story. A video showing how people were treated while protesting the pipeline went viral and included evidence that Dakota Access guard dogs had been attacking protestors. Dustin Tahmahkera, a member of the Comanche Nation of Oklahoma, and an interdisciplinary scholar of North American indigeneities, critical media and sound at the University of Illinois, said the Standing Rock protests were the first major event of Native activism that the mainstream media had picked up in decades. It was a reminder to the country that Native people are modern Americans and exist beyond the stories and histories that are taught in public education. "There was so much more awareness and raised consciousness," he said. "And still, so much further to go." Joanna Hearne, a professor of Native American film studies at the University of Missouri, also pointed to Standing Rock as a pivotal moment in altering perceptions in the entertainment industry. She added that the rise of streaming platforms offers more space for these voices outside of a traditional cable schedule and the success of other Indigenous people, some outside of North America, has helped showcase what Native talent can do. Hearne used writer and director Taika Waititi as an example of this. Waititi is Maori, an Indigenous people from New Zealand. While he made his start in the industry telling stories that reflected his experience in New Zealand, his most recent work, which includes the blockbuster Marvel film "Thor Ragnorak" and the Oscar-winning feature "Jojo Rabbit," shows that Indigenous people can use their unique experiences to tell universal stories. "This is a really exciting time for us and there's room, there's room for it and there's an audience for it," Schmieding said. "'Rutherford Falls' is like a nice little stepping stone into some even more nuanced, more engaging, exciting diverse Native and Indigenous content."

Bitcoin was trading around $38,767.62 at 3:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday and its price has risen over 9% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinDesk. Almost all of the other major cryptocurrencies are also higher. Ethereum's price has risen more than 15% in the last 24 hours to $2,634.79, while Dogecoin has seen its price rise more than 8% to 35 cents a coin.	The price of bitcoin is approaching $40,000 once again after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that was having active discussions with bitcoin miners regarding the sustainability of the digital coin. Bitcoin was trading around $38,767.62 at 3:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday and its price has risen over 9% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinDesk. Almost all of the other major cryptocurrencies are also higher. Ethereum's price has risen more than 15% in the last 24 hours to $2,634.79, while Dogecoin has seen its price rise more than 8% to 35 cents a coin. A small handful of less well-known cryptocurrencies such as Tether and Dai have seen their price fall in the last 24 hours, but the declines are negligible. Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, jumped minutes after Musk tweeted: "Spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current & planned renewable usage & to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising." The coin initially popped 4% to hit $39,824.81 a few hours later, before falling back to almost $38,000. Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor followed up on Musk's tweet, saying he hosted a meeting between the Tesla CEO and some bitcoin miners that led to the formation of the Bitcoin Mining Council, which will promote sustainability. Bitcoin mining requires vast amounts of energy. As a result, bitcoin has a carbon footprint comparable to that of New Zealand , producing 36.95 megatons of CO2 annually, according to Digiconomist. Musk has been a big supporter of cryptocurrencies, sparking rallies in the prices of digital coins, including bitcoin, several times in the past year. His tweets and comments around cryptocurrency often send the prices soaring or plunging. In an SEC filing in February, Tesla revealed that it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and would accept it as a form of payment. The company later said it registered a net gain of $101 million from sales of bitcoin during the quarter, helping to boost its net profits to a record high in the first quarter. However, Musk's relationship with the digital coin appeared to change earlier this month. He tweeted on May 12 that the company "suspended vehicle purchases" using bitcoin, out of concern over "rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels" for bitcoin mining. Bitcoin's rally this week comes after turmoil in the crypto markets that saw its price fall below $32,000 on Sunday. Last week's crypto sell-off came after authorities in China and the U.S. moved to tighten regulation and tax compliance on cryptocurrencies. Chinese authorities called for tighter regulation on crypto mining and trading on Friday, and the U.S. Treasury announced Thursday that it would require stricter crypto compliance with the IRS. — Additional reporting by CNBC's Jessica Bursztynsky.
China has released draft rules on various areas from antitrust to data protection as it aims to regulate its biggest technology firms. One expert said that the new rules, especially around data, are part of China's broader effort to become a "technological superpower." The European Union meanwhile has introduced the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act while wide-sweeping tech regulation in the U.S. is missing.	GUANGZHOU, China — China's recent moves to regulate large technology giants are part of its broader push to become a technological "superpower," one expert told CNBC. Like the U.S. and European Union, China is working out how to regulate the technology sector in many areas, from data protection to antitrust. China's technology companies have grown, largely unencumbered by regulation, and become among the biggest in the world. And there are a number of regulations that have come into effect or are in the works. In November, China's central bank and regulators released draft rules on so-called microlending, which included provisions such as capital requirements for technology firms offering loans. China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) has also published draft rules looking to stop monopolistic practices by internet platforms . It is one of the most wide-sweeping proposals in China to regulate large tech companies. Last month, SAMR said it had begun a probe into Alibaba over monopolistic practices. And in October, China released a draft personal data protection law aiming to regulate how companies process user data. All of these regulations are part of China's bigger effort to become a major global tech power, according to Kendra Schaefer, a partner at Trivium China, a research firm based in Beijing. "Underneath all of this stuff I think China understands that if it's going to become a technological superpower ... then it has to lay a solid regulatory foundation," Schaefer told CNBC's "Beyond the Valley" podcast. "It has to lay that foundation in the way that it regulates company operations, but it also has to lay that foundation in terms of data. In fact, data might be the most important regulations that it has got to lay down." "All of these things are foundational and it's really just kind of setting a framework, a springboard from which China can develop and move forward faster." Beijing appears to have taken a harder stance against the country's technology firms recently. In November, regulators forced Ant Group, the finance affiliate of Alibaba, to suspend plans for what would have been the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO) , while the company dealt with regulatory changes. Last month, Alibaba and two other firms were slapped with a fine for not making the proper declarations to authorities about past acquisitions. But this does not mean Beijing is working in opposition to its tech champions, according to Emily de La Bruyere, co-founder of consultancy Horizon Advisory. "These multinational tech companies are decidedly the force enablers that China uses to extend its information and standards strategy globally. That's not going to change. We're not going to see Beijing turn on its Big Tech the way Washington appears to be," Bruyere told CNBC by email. "But, Beijing is going to ensure that its Big Tech acts by its rules and regulations, connects to its platforms, and serves its strategies." It's not just China bringing in sweeping changes on tech regulation. The European Union has been perhaps the most aggressive region in the world on the issue. Its landmark General Data Protection Regulation approved in 2016, sought to bring in rules around how user data was processed. And in December, the EU introduced the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act which aims to bring stricter controls on the behavior of tech giants in a number of areas. But the U.S. has yet to take a similar approach with wide-ranging legislation around areas like data. "We don't have good data regulation in the U.S. yet," Trivium China's Schaefer said. "So we don't have that foundation, those kind of basic fundamental principles, on which we can regulate, not only our domestic companies but foreign incoming companies as well." "I think that us not having that fundamental data policy is one of the reasons that we are taking this bizarre scattershot approach to trying to control incoming Chinese apps like TikTok, targeting specific Chinese companies because we don't have a universal regulation." Schaefer was referencing the ongoing saga of Washington trying to get Chinese company ByteDance to sell the U.S. operations of TikTok .
China's Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said Thursday he hoped the U.S. presidential election would proceed stably and smoothly. He was speaking at an unrelated press conference, according to state media. Chinese-language state media have been relatively muted on the U.S. presidential election, amid rapt attention from many social media users and privately run media outlets.	BEIJING — China's Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said Thursday he hopes the next U.S. administration will take steps to work with the Asian country. As the world waits for news on who will become the next U.S. president, Le said he hoped the election would proceed stably and smoothly. That's according to a CNBC translation of a Chinese state media report about Le's remarks Thursday at a press conference about an unrelated upcoming summit. "The Chinese attitude on China-U.S. relations is clear and consistent," the report said, citing Le. "Although there are disagreements between China and the U.S., there is vast room for mutual benefit and cooperation. (I) hope the new U.S. administration will meet China halfway." That approach would include "upholding a principle of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation," Le said, according to the report. The world's two largest economies have been locked in escalating tensions over the last two years, beginning with trade and spilling over into technology and geopolitics. Analysts expect U.S. policy on China will stick to a more stringent tone, regardless of which candidate wins. "The truth of the matter is that being tough on China is what unifies us in a polarized nation right now," former top White House trade negotiator Clete Willems told CNBC's " Squawk Box Asia " on Thursday. "We're polarized in our politics but we are not polarized on China." While U.S. presidential election polls have already closed, vote counting is expected to continue over the coming days. As of Thursday afternoon, it was still not clear whether U.S. President Donald Trump would win reelection, or whether Democratic nominee Joe Biden would become the next president. Analysts have pointed out that a Biden administration would likely draw American allies together to form a more unified strategy against Beijing than the Trump administration has. On Wednesday evening, Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a key speech that his country would speed up trade talks with the EU, Japan and South Korea, without mentioning the U.S. "China is keen to secure additional (free-trade agreements) as part of its broader goal to diversify its sources of imports, especially for strategically important goods like core technologies, energy and food," Imogen Page-Jarrett, research analyst for China at The Economist Intelligence Unit (The EIU), said in a statement. "Rising geopolitical friction with the US (and other western countries) could mean that that country cuts off China's access to certain goods in the future," Page-Jarrett said. In contrast to Le's remarks, Chinese-language state media have been relatively muted on the U.S. presidential election, amid rapt attention from many social media users and privately run media outlets. Many posts and articles on the ubiquitous messaging app WeChat focused on the election, while hashtags for Trump's win in Florida and his first two tweets since Election Day were among the top 25 trending on Twitter-like platform Weibo on Wednesday. In an English-language editorial published late Wednesday by international-facing state-run newspaper China Daily , the authors said the election marked an "opportunity" for the U.S. to change its policy on China. "It should not be squandered," the editorial said. The more outspoken state-run tabloid Global Times published English-language articles late Wednesday that tried to paint recent unrest in the U.S. as issues that "contradict democratic values" and called out "failed elite media mentality" in the U.S. for "misleading polls" that "distort reality." Widely followed Global Times Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin wrote in a Chinese-language article Thursday that Biden's gains, particularly in Michigan, mean Trump will soon face a difficult choice of whether to admit defeat, or dispute the result. — CNBC's Saheli Roy Choudhury contributed to this report.
India has banned 118 apps with links to China, saying they were "hostile to national security." Major gaming titles from companies including Tencent and NetEase were on the list, as well as apps from other Chinese technology giants like Baidu and Alibaba affiliate, Ant Group. The latest app ban comes as tensions flare up between China and India over the disputed Himalayan mountain border in the region of Ladakh.	India has banned 118 apps with links to China, citing national security risks. It comes against a backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions between the two nations. Major gaming titles from companies including Tencent and NetEase were on the list, as well as apps from other Chinese technology giants like Baidu and Alibaba affiliate, Ant Group. India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said that in "in view of the emergent nature of threats" it has "decided to block 118 mobile apps ... since in view of information available they are engaged in activities which is prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order." The Indian government said it had "received many complaints from various sources" including reports about "misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India." The ministry said this was "hostile to national security." "On the basis of these and upon receiving of recent credible inputs that information posted, permissions sought, functionality embedded as well as data harvesting practices of above stated Apps raise serious concerns that these Apps collect and share data in surreptitious manner and compromise personal data and information of users that can have a severe threat to security of the State," the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said. Ant Group and Baidu declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. Alibaba, Tencent and NetEase were not immediately available for comment. The latest app ban comes as tensions flare between China and India over the disputed Himalayan mountain border in the region of Ladakh. In June, a border clash between the two nations left 20 Indian soldiers dead . The Baidu app, Tencent's WeChat Reading app and Ant Group's Alipay, China's most popular mobile payment service, are on India's list of banned apps. It's important to note that some of the apps on the list don't really have a presence in India. In fact, Alipay isn't available in India for local users. However, some of the games have large followings in India. For example, "PUBG Mobile Nordic Map: Livik," a game developed by Tencent, has had 93,000,000 downloads since its release in 2018, according to Sensor Tower. It is the highest grossing app on India's list, raking in $39,600,000 since its release.
Thailand has over the past week lost several government ministers — including those holding crucial economic portfolios — as the coronavirus pandemic slams the tourism-dependent Southeast Asian economy. Six ministers have resigned, including Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana and Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak, whom a Reuters report referred to as an "economic policy czar." It's not yet clear who will take over those positions, but Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has said he will announce a cabinet reshuffle by next month. The Thai economy is expected to register the worst contraction in Asia this year, while its currency and stock market have also been among the worst performing in the region despite its relative success in containing the virus outbreak.	Thailand has over the past week lost several government ministers — including those holding crucial economic portfolios — as the coronavirus pandemic slams the tourism-dependent Southeast Asian economy. The country has a history of political instability and has also experienced one of the highest numbers of military coups in modern history. The latest upheaval has come at a time when the government faces pressure to improve the country's economy while large-scale pro-democracy demonstrations have called for the resignation of the government. So far, six ministers have resigned from their position, reported Reuters. That include Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana and Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak, whom the Reuters report referred to as an "economic policy czar." It's not yet clear who will take over those positions, but Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has said he will announce a cabinet reshuffle by next month. Some analysts said delays in replacing the country's crucial economic architects could hurt investor confidence at a time when the Thai economy is expected to register the worst contraction in Asia this year. The Thai currency and stock market have also been among the worst performing in the region despite the country's relative success in containing its virus outbreak.  As of Tuesday, the Thai baht had lost around 6% against the U.S. dollar while the benchmark stock index, SET Index, has fallen close to 13% so far this year. The ministers' resignations followed earlier reports of a power struggle within the ruling coalition's largest party, Palang Pracharath. The party and its political partners control a slim majority in Thailand's 500-member House of Representatives. Before their resignation from the government, four of the ministers — including former Finance Minister Uttama — quit Palang Pracharath as party members, reported the Associated Press . Uttama was leader of the pro-military party. Harrison Cheng, associate director and lead analyst for Thailand at consultancy Control Risks, said the cabinet reshuffle has triggered an "intense jockeying" for government positions among members of the ruling coalition. That could also worsen infighting among members, he added. He explained in a note last week that the prime minister's plan to recruit "reputable individuals" from the public and private sectors to lead several economic ministries will "trigger deep resentment" among the different political factions. Still, the Prayuth government is likely to stay intact as parties within the ruling coalition have little to gain from withdrawing, said Cheng. The opposition also doesn't have the numbers to challenge the ruling coalition, he added. "Disagreements are likely to flare up both within the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP) and among coalition members, and could delay the finalisation of the reshuffle by up to two months, which is likely to hurt investor confidence," wrote Cheng. Prayuth has reportedly invited a top Thai banker to join his new cabinet lineup. Some local media reports also named the country's outgoing central bank governor Veerathai Santiprabhob as a possible candidate — but Reuters reported that Veerathai has ruled out joining the new cabinet. The Thai economy, which is heavily dependent on tourism, is expected to register the worst economic contraction in Asia this year, according to forecasts by Capital Economics. The consultancy projected Thailand's gross domestic product to slump by 9% in 2020. The Thai parliament in May approved a 1.9 trillion baht ($59.8 billion) economic stimulus and the government has penciled in a larger deficit for its fiscal year starting Oct. 1 as it seeks to revive the economy. Analysts from Japanese bank Nomura said in a note last week that they don't expect changes in the cabinet to substantially alter the government's spending plans. But "there may be some concerns over the execution of fiscal measures," they added, pointing to the departure of the former Deputy Prime Minister Somkid. "The resignation of Somkid, who was the architect of Prayut's economic policies, causes some policy uncertainty at a critical time when the economy is going through a deep recession," read the note. But analysts from Australian bank ANZ said in a note last week that "political uncertainty is not new to Thailand." They added that despite the departures of key economic ministers, they expect Thailand's policy to "remain focused on engineering a recovery."
"In order to realize such hopeful games, we will continue to do our best to fight against the infectious disease," Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told CNBC. The governor refrained from guaranteeing the event would take place a year from now, acknowledging hurdles tied to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government raised its alert system to the highest possible level last week as cases rise in the capital.	As the one-year countdown gets underway for the postponed 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics , the athletes aren't the only participants gearing up for the biggest battle of their career. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike is vowing to do her best to keep the games alive. Tokyo 2020 "can become a symbol of how the world has united to overcome the hardship and how humanity has strengthened its bonds," Koike told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday, just weeks after securing a resounding second-term election victory. The governor refrained from guaranteeing the event would take place a year from now, acknowledging hurdles tied to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic . "In order to realize such hopeful games, we will continue to do our best to fight against the infectious disease," she said. She also acknowledged the importance of shoring up support for the games among people in Japan. According to a poll released by Kyodo news agency last week, less than a quarter of respondents want to see the games held in 2021 . Just over 36% favored a further delay to the games and nearly 34% think the event should be cancelled outright, the poll found. In addition to making sure the games are carried out safely, the governor said she's also been tasked with keeping the costs of the event in check. The decision in March to postpone the Olympics dealt a blow to Tokyo's economy at a time when the pandemic has pushed Japan into a recession. Proposals have been floated to scale back aspects of the event, such as the opening and closing ceremony, which could satisfy some of the health and financial concerns. When asked whether a slimmed down version of the games would go ahead without spectators altogether, Koike declined to comment, insisting that "first of all, we have to win the victory against the coronavirus." The governor has won plaudits for her handling of the crisis to date, which likely contributed to her stronger-than-expected election result earlier this month. Koike secured the second-largest voter count in Tokyo's gubernatorial history, fueling speculation about her eventual bid to become prime minister. Cases of the coronavirus have been rising steadily since voting day, however, prompting concern across the capital. Tokyo recorded 237 new cases on Tuesday, down slightly from a record 293 cases reported last Friday, according to Kyodo. That brings the city's total reported cases to 9,816, according to the news agency. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government raised its alert system to the highest possible level last week, in order to warn residents about the risk of transmission. When asked about the upward trend, the governor noted that the number of deaths was "very limited" and that the number of severe cases was also limited, relative to the rest of the world. While acknowledging the case for caution and further preventative measures, Koike said now was not the time to request another state of emergency, which was lifted in May. "I think this is the time to live peacefully and safely with the current Covid-19," she said, calling on individuals and businesses to play their part in the ongoing fight.

While U.S. President Donald Trump could realistically attack the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the greenback, the cost would be "very high," said Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered Bank. Two methods the White House could use to damage the peg would likely backfire, Liu told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Wednesday. "But impacting one of the world's largest reserve managers' ability to hold U.S. dollar reserve assets would seriously undermine U.S. dollar's role as the international reserve currency," she added.	While U.S. President Donald Trump could realistically attack the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the greenback, the cost would be "very high," said Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered Bank. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Trump aides had dropped the idea due to inadequate support and concerns about implementation as well as whether the move would backfire. Bloomberg had previously reported that top advisors had considered undermining the peg in weighing potential retaliation for China imposing a national security law in Hong Kong . Two methods the White House could use to damage the peg would likely backfire, Liu told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Wednesday. One approach would involve the U.S. undermining Hong Kong exchange funds' ability to hold U.S. dollar-denominated assets, said Liu. "But impacting one of the world's largest reserve managers' ability to hold U.S. dollar reserve assets would seriously undermine U.S. dollar's role as the international reserve currency," she added. The Trump administration could also undercut Hong Kong banks' ability to obtain the greenback or strip them of their ability to conduct dollar clearing activities. But that would hurt the international financial markets "too severely" and could bring about an international financial crisis, she added. The market however should not rule out the possibility that the Trump administration could restrict some banks —particularly Hong Kong branches of Chinese banks — from accessing U.S. dollar liquidity or from conducting dollar payments, she said. Amid geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, Liu said the "Hong Kong dollar is China's U.S. dollar." Last week, Trump signed legislation to impose sanctions on China . The law, dubbed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, would slap mandatory sanctions on Chinese officials and companies that helped back Beijing's imposition of a security law. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has repeatedly criticized the national security law in Hong Kong, calling it " Orwellian ." Liu said companies on the U.S. entity list would want to avoid some direct dollar risk exposure — and the Hong Kong dollar has become the best alternative. With Chinese companies potentially delisting from U.S. exchanges, the Hong Kong market has become the best alternative for companies looking to raise funds in foreign currencies other than the Chinese yuan. As Hong Kong's foreign exchange reserves are among the largest globally, the currency of the Chinese special administrative territory is "difficult to attack," said Liu. "As such, it has become one of the alternative best currencies for those Chinese companies who cannot avoid U.S. dollar currency risk, but it has become increasingly more risky for them to be directly holding U.S. dollar or U.S. dollar account." Due to the narrow band in which the Hong Kong dollar is trading in, "holding (the) Hong Kong dollar is almost equivalent in terms of holding U.S. dollar when it comes to currency exposure and we expected Hong Kong dollar to play a much larger role amid these geopolitical tensions." — CNBC's Weizhen Tan contributed to this report.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's speech slamming China was an "angry lament" and "extended ideological rant" that would do little to change Beijing's behavior, said Daniel Russel, former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Specifically, Pompeo's seeming attempt to rally the Chinese people against the Communist Party of China has the opposite effect of increasing support for the ruling party, he said. Pompeo in his speech called for engagement and empowerment of the Chinese people, whom he described as "dynamic and freedom-loving people who are completely distinct from the Chinese Communist Party."	U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's speech slamming China was an "angry lament" and "extended ideological rant" that would do little to change Beijing's behavior, said a former top American diplomat to Asia. Specifically, Pompeo's seeming attempt to rally the Chinese people against the Communist Party of China is "primitive and ineffective" that's likely to increase support for Chinese President Xi Jinping , said Daniel Russel, who was appointed as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs by President Barack Obama and served from 2013 to 2017. "This sort of denunciation (is) having the opposite effect, in bolstering support in China for Xi Jinping and deepening anger towards the United States," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Friday. "Complaining is not fixing and denouncing is not diplomacy," said Russel, who's now vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Pompeo on Thursday delivered a sweeping address at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, saying the U.S. will no longer tolerate Beijing's playbook to usurp global order and calling on allies to "induce China to change." He also called for the engagement and empowerment of the Chinese people, whom he described as "dynamic and freedom-loving people who are completely distinct from the Chinese Communist Party." Michael Hirson, Eurasia Group's practice head for China and Northeast Asia, said the secretary of State's remarks got as close as he could to calling for a regime change in China. But with the U.S. presidential election nearing, Chinese policymakers are unlikely to react in way that would "fundamentally" change the two countries' relationship, he said. "So they're, to some extent, absorbing these body blows and I think waiting for after the election to decide where Beijing wants to take this relationship," Hirson told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Friday. "For the time being, they're watching it evolve and are not prepared to take drastic changes that would change the way that Beijing is dealing with this new challenge from the U.S.," he added. Relations between the U.S. and China — the world's top two economies — have been at their worst in decades. In addition to the countries' ongoing trade war, both sides have recently sparred over a range of issues including the origin of the coronavirus and China's move to implement a national security law in Hong Kong. Russel said the "blame China" and "get tough on China" rhetoric in the U.S. means tensions between the two countries could worsen. "This is sort of an immovable object meeting an irresistible force, there's a lot of friction and it's unlikely to end well," he added. — CNBC's Amanda Macias contributed to this report
The conviction of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak presents "a renewed hope" for Malaysians who voted the ex-leader out of power two years ago, said Anwar Ibrahim, the country's top opposition leader. Najib  was sentenced to 12 years in jail and handed a fine of 210 million Malaysian ringgit ($49.3 million) after he was found guilty of all charges in his first trial linked to the financial scandal at 1MDB. Anwar said there were some concerns that the appeal process could result in an overturn of Najib's conviction.	The conviction of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak presents "a renewed hope" for Malaysians who voted the ex-leader out of power two years ago, the country's top opposition political leader said Wednesday. Najib was sentenced to 12 years in jail and handed a fine of 210 million Malaysian ringgit ($49.3 million) after he was found guilty of all seven charges in the first of his five trials linked to the financial scandal at  state-owned fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. "It is a renewed hope for Malaysians in general who were upset with the recent political development but at least they believe now that the climate for change and, finally, the voice of the people must be heard," Anwar Ibrahim, the opposition leader, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia." Some observers and analysts said the fall of Najib — a former top political office holder — in the court of law was a rare occurrence in Southeast Asian politics and an important one in Malaysia's long battle against corruption. "Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak made history ... when he became the country's highest-ranking official ever to be convicted in court," said  Francis Hutchinson, senior fellow and coordinator of the Malaysia studies program at Singaporean think tank ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. The multi-billion dollar scandal at 1MDB — which involved Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs and Hollywood — made international headlines and involved investigations  by at least six countries. Najib's alleged role in siphoning around 4 billion ringgit (nearly $1 billion) out of the state fund partly contributed to the defeat of his political coalition in the 2018 general elections. The 67-year-old Najib, who served as Malaysia's sixth prime minister, faces a total of 42 charges in five separate trials. The charges include money laundering, abuse of power and criminal breach of trust. On Tuesday, the  former prime minister was granted bail and a stay of execution on both the jail term and fine. He had indicated that he would appeal the verdict. Anwar said there were some concerns that the appeal process could result in an overturn of Najib's conviction. He explained that while the country's chief justice is known to be "protective" of the judiciary's independence, "I don't necessarily feel this is being shared by all her colleagues in the top echelon of the judiciary." "So we hope for the best," he added. Still, analysts hailed the ruling as a landmark decision. "This is the first time in Malaysia's history that an ex-prime minister has been charged in court for abuse of power and corruption," said James Chin, director of Asia Institute Tasmania at the University of Tasmania in Australia. "For a very long time, not only in Malaysia but in the whole region, it was widely understood and an unwritten rule that if you made it to the number one political office, you normally are protected from abuse of power prosecution. So I think for historical reasons, I think it's a very important case," he said on CNBC's "Squawk Box  Asia" on Wednesday. The appeal process could take many months or even years to conclude, but "it is hard to understate the importance of this case for Malaysia," said Hutchinson. "It will help restore confidence in the country's institutions, many of which have been eroded over the past four decades," he wrote in a Tuesday note.
At  least 12 pro-democracy nominees, including high profile activist Joshua Wong, have been disqualified from running in Hong Kong's upcoming elections, authorities said in a statement on Thursday. Incumbent lawmakers Dennis Kwok and Alvin Yeung, as well as Lester Shum, a student leader in the so-called Umbrella Movement, were also barred from standing as candidates in the legislative council elections. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab slammed the move, saying: "I condemn the decision to disqualify opposition candidates from standing in Hong Kong's Legislative Council elections."	The United Kingdom has condemned Hong Kong's decision to disqualify pro-democracy candidates from the upcoming legislative council election. Other critics around the world have also raised concerns over the upcoming polls. It comes as authorities announced Thursday that at least 12 pro-democracy nominees, including high profile activist Joshua Wong, have been disqualified from running in Hong Kong's upcoming elections. The Hong Kong government does "not rule out the possibility" that more nominees will be disqualified, it said. Incumbent lawmakers Dennis Kwok and Alvin Yeung, as well as Lester Shum, a student leader in the so-called Umbrella Movement, were also barred from standing as candidates in the legislative council elections. Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China and a former British colony that has a separate legal and economic system from mainland China. The Hong Kong government said the 12 potential candidates were disqualified because their nominations were "not in compliance with the requirement under the Legislative Council Ordinance." British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab slammed the move. "I condemn the decision to disqualify opposition candidates from standing in Hong Kong's Legislative Council elections," Raab said in a statement on Thursday. "It is clear they have been disqualified because of their political views, undermining the integrity of 'One Country, Two Systems' and the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Joint Declaration and Hong Kong's Basic Law." Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, is ruled under the "one country, two systems" policy. That framework grants allows those living there limited election rights. The upcoming election will be Hong Kong's first since the national security law came into effect. Chinese officials said the law is meant to prohibit secession, subversion of state power, terrorism activities and foreign interference . But critics worry it could undermine the principle of "one country, two systems" that was guaranteed under a treaty signed by the U.K. and China before Hong Kong's sovereignty transfer, and meant to remain in place until 2047. Nominations for the election close on Friday. The vote is scheduled to be held in early September, though media reports suggest that it may be delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China — a coalition of lawmakers from various countries including Australia, Canada and Japan — said the obstructions were "unacceptable." "The decision to disqualify democratic candidates and the anticipated delay to September's Legislative Council election represent unacceptable obstructions of the democratic process in Hong Kong and raise further concerns about the erosion of rights and freedoms in the city," they said in a statement . U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Hong Kong to proceed with the elections as planned. "They must be held. The people of Hong Kong deserve to have their voice represented by the elected officials that they choose in those elections," Pompeo said on a radio program, according to an official transcript. More than 600,000 people in Hong Kong showed support for younger nominees in an unofficial primary in mid-July, according to Reuters. At a press conference on Friday, pro-democracy activist Wong said: "Beijing has staged multiple acts to prevent the opposition bloc from taking the majority in Hong Kong's legislature." "Banning me from running (in) the elections would not stop our cause for democracy, even though the government could soon declare democratic aspirations illegal under the new law," he added. On Thursday, he wrote on Twitter that Beijing is showing "total disregard" for what Hong Kong citizens want and is quashing the city's "last pillar of vanishing autonomy."
According to Hong Kong law, an election can be postponed if the city's chief executive believes it is likely to be "obstructed, disrupted, undermined or seriously affected by riot or open violence or any danger to public health and safety." The vote was initially scheduled to take place on Sept. 6.	Hong Kong's legislative council election will be postponed by a year, the city's leader Carrie Lam announced Friday amid a new surge in coronavirus cases. The vote was initially scheduled to take place on Sept. 6 but will now take place on Sept. 5, 2021, according to Lam. She said that central government supported the decision and it was taken to safeguard people's health. "The announcement I have to make today is the most difficult decision I've had to make in the past seven months," Lam said at a news conference, according to the Associated Press. "We want to ensure fairness and public safety and health, and need to make sure the election is held in an open, fair and impartial manner. This decision is therefore essential," she said. As of July 30, authorities reported 149 additional cases of Covid-19, bringing the city's total to at least 3,151, according to the city's health department . Hong Kong was initially hailed for its response to the pandemic, and was able to avoid widespread lockdowns that many countries imposed to stem the spread of the disease. However, the coronavirus reemerged and confirmed cases reached new daily highs in recent weeks. The postponement of the election came after Hong Kong authorities announced Thursday that 12 pro-democracy nominees have been disqualified from running in the upcoming elections. Among them was high profile activist, Joshua Wong, and incumbent lawmakers Dennis Kwok and Alvin Yeung. According to Hong Kong law, an election can be postponed if the city's chief executive believes it is likely to be "obstructed, disrupted, undermined or seriously affected by riot or open violence or any danger to public health and safety." Voting typically has to take place within 14 days of the original date, but the city's leader also has power to make regulations when there are "occasions of emergency or public danger." The disqualification of the pro-democracy candidates drew criticism overseas , including British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab who slammed the move. In a statement on the U.K. government's website , Raab said it was "clear they have been disqualified because of their political views, undermining the integrity of 'One Country, Two Systems' and the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Joint Declaration and Hong Kong's Basic Law." Hong Kong has been ruled under the "one country, two systems" policy since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. That framework grants the Chinese territory a largely separate economic and legal system, and allows those living there limited election rights. Rumors of a delay of the election were already swirling even before the announcement. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday urged Hong Kong to proceed with the elections as planned. Following local media reports on a possible delay, pro-democracy activist Wong, said on Twitter that "using (the) pandemic as an excuse to postpone the election is definitely a lie." He said hygiene measures can be stepped up to lower the risk of infection during voting. The government reimposed social distancing rules and tightened the restrictions further this week. The measures were tougher than those introduced when the health crisis first emerged in the early part of the year. Dine-in services were suspended and gatherings of more than two people were banned in late July, while face masks were made mandatory in all public places. "But the (government) knows only to interfere with the election that used to be free and fair, either disqualifying my candidacy or to call off the election," Wong said on Twitter. The September election would have been the city's first since its controversial national security law came into effect at the end of June. Beijing said the law is meant to prohibit secession, subversion of state power, terrorism and foreign interference , but critics feared it would be used to crush dissent. An unofficial primary in July reportedly saw over 600,000 people show up to cast a symbolic vote, according to Reuters , which cited the opposition camp. Anyone convicted of an offence under the new national security legislation cannot stand as a candidate in elections for the legislative council or district councils.
A draft mandatory code announced by the Australian government would force Google and Facebook to pay news outlets for using their content. The new rules are aimed at addressing "acute bargaining power imbalances" between news groups and Google and Facebook, the ACCC said. Google said it was "deeply disappointed and concerned" by the draft code, while Facebook said it would currently reviewing the proposals.	Google and Facebook could be forced to pay Australian news publishers to distribute their content, in a landmark regulatory move from the country's competition regulator. The Australia Competition and Consumer Commission was tasked by the government earlier this year with developing a mandatory code for the tech giants to pay for their use of news content. If approved, a draft code announced by the ACCC Friday would allow Australian outlets to secure payments in a matter of months. It is aimed at addressing "acute bargaining power imbalances" between news groups and Google and Facebook, the ACCC said. Under the rules, if the publishers and digital platforms are unable to agree a deal after three months of formal talks, a "final offer" arbitration process will be? initiated that results in the selection of the "most reasonable" offer in 45 business days. "Our regulatory changes are designed to create a level playing field and a fair-go," Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Friday. "We want the rules in the digital world to reflect the rules in the physical world. We want to ensure consumer protection is enhanced, competition is increased and of course we deliver a sustainable media environment for all Australians for the future." Tweet The move could see Australia become the first country to force Google and Facebook to pay for news content. It comes after talks between the online platforms, ACCC and media companies failed to result in agreement. The draft code will undergo a month-long consultation before being debated in parliament. If it is passed, it is expected to be reviewed in a year's time. It's not yet clear how much the development will impact Google and Facebook's revenues. Google parent company Alphabet reported its first revenue decline in history in its second-quarter earnings report Thursday, while Facebook posted an 11% climb in revenues. The two firms have been under the regulatory spotlight of late, with their CEOs appearing alongside the bosses of Amazon and Apple in a congressional antitrust hearing on Wednesday. Google said it was "deeply disappointed and concerned" by the ACCC's draft mandatory code. "The Code discounts the already significant value Google provides to news publishers across the board — including sending billions of clicks to Australian news publishers for free every year worth $218 million," Mel Silva, managing director of Google Australia and New Zealand, said in a statement Friday. "It sends a concerning message to businesses and investors that the Australian Government will intervene instead of letting the market work, and undermines Australia's ambition to become a leading digital economy by 2030. It sets up a perverse disincentive to innovate in the media sector and does nothing to solve the fundamental challenges of creating a business model fit for the digital age." William Easton, Facebook's managing director of Australia and New Zealand, said the company was currently "reviewing the Government's proposal to understand the impact it will have on the industry, our services and our investment in the news ecosystem in Australia." Last month, Google said it would pay some publishers in Australia, Germany and Brazil directly to license their content, as part of a new service expected to launch later this year. It marked a change in tack for the internet giant, which has for years fended off demands from news organizations to pay for the distribution of their work. France's competition regulator ruled in April that Google must pay publishing firms and news agencies for reusing their content. Such regulatory pressure has heightened at a time when news outlets are grappling with a sharp decline in advertising expenditure due to the coronavirus pandemic.
China has nominated a candidate for a judge's position in the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, a court that hears and settles maritime dispute. The U.S. opposed the idea and suggested that China shouldn't be given a seat because it disregards international maritime law in the South China Sea. "Electing a PRC official to this body is like hiring an arsonist to help run the Fire Department," David Stilwell, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said last month.	China has nominated a Chinese  candidate for a judge's position in an international tribunal that settles maritime disputes. But the U.S. is seeking to stop China, arguing that Beijing has flouted international sea laws in the disputed South China Sea. "Electing a PRC official to this body is like hiring an arsonist to help run the Fire Department," said David Stilwell, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, at an online forum held by think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies last month. PRC refers to the People's Republic of China, the official name of the country. "We urge all countries involved in the upcoming International Tribunal election to carefully assess the credentials of the PRC candidate and consider whether a PRC judge on the Tribunal will help or hinder international maritime law. Given Beijing's record, the answer should be clear," he added. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea is expected to hold an election in August or September to select seven judges to serve a nine-year term. All 168 signatories of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, will cast their votes in the election. The UNCLOS is an international treaty that outlines nations' rights and responsibilities in the world's ocean space. It forms the basis for how international courts, such as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, settle maritime disputes.  In 2016, a tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration dismissed China's claims of nearly 90% of the South China Sea as baseless according to UNCLOS principles. China, which negotiated and ratified the convention, refused to accept or recognize the ruling. Meanwhile, the U.S . is not allowed to  vote in the tribunal election because it has not ratified the convention. That's a point raised by Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman at China's foreign ministry,  who disputed Stilwell's arguments. "So far, the United States has not ratified the UNCLOS, but has always posed as a defender of it," Hua said at a regular media conference by the ministry last month after she was asked for her comments. "Judges of the Tribunal perform their duties in their personal capacity," she said, defending her country's candidate as one who's "well versed in international law and the law of the sea," according to an official transcript released on the ministry's website. It's not the first time that China has put up a candidate for the election of judges for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. In fact, three Chinese judges have served at the judicial body since the first election was held in 1996, according to the tribunal's website. But the U.S. brought attention to China's latest nomination as it toughened its stance against continued Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, a resource-rich waterway that's a vital shipping lane for global trade. Stilwell's comments at the CSIS forum came a day after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called China's claims to "offshore resources" in the South China Sea "completely unlawful." The U.S. has long promoted freedom of navigation by air and sea across the waterway. However, China claims nearly all of South China Sea, an area encompassing about 1.4 million square miles, that stretches from Singapore to the Straits of Taiwan. China backs up its claims and activities in the sea — including drilling for oil and creating artificial islands — with a vague "nine-dash line" that it said delineated Chinese historical territory in olden maps. The nine-dash line, which overlaps with territorial claims by several parties, was dismissed in the 2016 tribunal ruling. According to UNCLOS, coastal states have sovereign rights to national resources within 200 nautical miles from their shores, and can conduct certain economic activities and maritime research within that area. The area marked out by the nine-dash line stretches far beyond 200 nautical miles from China's coast. Analysts said a tougher stance by Washington against Beijing in the South China Sea could encourage other claimants to be more assertive toward Beijing. Many of the territorial claimants are smaller Southeast Asian states such as Vietnam and the Philippines,  which have strong economic ties to China. "The next time a China Coast Guard ship plays chicken with an oil rig off Vietnam or a flotilla of Chinese fishing boats appears in Indonesian waters, the United States will likely speak up more forcefully to decry the illegal action," said Greg Poling, senior fellow for Southeast Asia and director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at CSIS. "And that will have a proportionately greater effect on China's international reputation."
"We cannot completely block off all relationships with China economically. At least, that's the way I see it, because we need to progress," said M. K. Narayanan, a former national security advisor to India. Relations between the two nuclear powers deteriorated after a border clash in the Himalayas killed 20 Indian soldiers. Beijing did not disclose information on casualties suffered by the Chinese side.	India cannot completely cut off its economic ties with China even though tensions between the countries have escalated in recent months, a former national security advisor to India told CNBC. Relations between the two nuclear powers deteriorated after a border clash in the Himalayas killed 20 Indian soldiers. Beijing did not disclose information on casualties suffered by the Chinese side. "We cannot completely block off all relationships with China economically. At least, that's the way I see it, because we need to progress," M. K. Narayanan told CNBC's " Street Signs Asia " on Monday. Narayanan was the former national security advisor between 2005 to 2010 and spent most of his public service career working in intelligence. India's foreign ministry said last month that both sides agreed that "early and complete disengagement of the troops" along their de facto border — known as the Line of Actual Control — and de-escalation of border areas were essential for smooth bilateral relations. The border clash soured public sentiment in India toward Chinese brands, leading to calls to boycott Chinese businesses. The bilateral relationship is currently skewed in China's favor in areas of trade, investment and technology , data showed. New Delhi has introduced measures in recent months that either sidelined or banned Chinese companies from one of the world's largest consumer markets. They included restricting Chinese investments into India even before the border face-off occurred. India also recently banned several dozen Chinese apps including the highly popular short video-sharing app, TikTok. Existing contracts with Chinese vendors were also canceled and there were reports suggesting Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE might eventually be excluded from India's 5G development. In most of those decisions, India did not specifically name China but, rather, justified the moves on national security grounds, according to a note from consultancy Eurasia Group. "We're not enemies, but I think there's always a problem about being friends," Narayanan said. "There is a competition between the two civilizations." Narayanan explained that India needs to focus on managing its economic relationship with China rather than shutting it down completely. He referred to India's refusal last year to be part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership , which would form a major trading bloc involving Asia's top economies, including China, and cover nearly a third of the world's GDP. Some saw India's presence in RCEP as a counterbalance to China. "We left the field practically open for China," he said. "I think India cannot afford to step back. India needs to be in the economic arena, the economic space. I think India's drive in recent years has been such that I think we can fulfill that objective." Analysts have said that recent tensions between the two neighbors could potentially push India to establish closer ties with the United States and countries like Japan and Australia.
In the last few months, China has stepped up its military and navy activity around the island, spurring Taiwanese Premier Su Tseng-chang to say late June that China was "disturbing" the island. Some China watchers fear a military conflict between the two lands. Experts say China will likely intensify its efforts to isolate Taiwan internationally, and some expressed concerns there may be a risk of military conflict. "Everything else having failed, Xi may therefore feel compelled to put a premium on a military strategy in the Taiwan Strait," says Michael Cole from the Global Taiwan Institute.	Taiwan appears to be distancing itself from China in recent months, as military activities around the island intensify amid heightened U.S.-China tensions and the coronavirus pandemic. In late July, Taiwan's legislature approved two proposals. One was to rename carrier China Airlines , and the other was to highlight the word Taiwan on passports, which are currently marked "Republic of China" — Taiwan's official name. In the last few months, China has stepped up its military and navy activity around the island, spurring Taiwanese Premier Su Tseng-chang to say late June that Beijing was "disturbing" the island. Experts say China will likely intensify its efforts to isolate Taiwan internationally, and some expressed concerns there may be a risk of military conflict, particularly as the island is caught in the crosshairs of Sino-U.S. friction. U.S.-China relations have deteriorated significantly in recent months, with both countries ordering the other to shut down their respective consulates in Houston and Chengdu. This could lead to "some kind of a military dust-up" that may involve areas where China is caught up in territorial or sovereignty disputes — such as the South China Sea or East China Sea or Taiwan, said Orville Schell, Arthur Ross director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at Asia Society. Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that Taiwan is the most important and sensitive issue in U.S.-China ties. Beijing claims democratic self-ruled Taiwan as part of China's territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the two together. The Chinese Communist Party has never governed Taiwan. Current relations between China and Taiwan are among the chilliest in decades after Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen's election in 2016, which led to Beijing cutting off official communication with Taipei. Tsai from the independence-leaning Democratic progressive party won a second term in January with a record number of votes. "Rather than weaken the appeal of Taiwan's democracy and erode its support, China's sustained 'sharp power' activities toward Taiwan have resulted in a stronger embrace of democratic governance and willingness to defend it," wrote J. Michael Cole, a senior non-resident fellow at the Global Taiwan Institute, a Washington D.C.-based think tank. Taipei's moves to distance itself from Beijing will not sit well with Beijing, analysts say. "All of these gestures — particularly when they come from Taiwan — these kind of decoupling gestures are considered to be provocations in the mainland," said Schell. Mainland China and Taiwan share close links in culture and business, but recently, Taiwan's regulatory authorities are reportedly looking to tighten mainland investment scrutiny in Taiwanese companies over concerns that Beijing could get access to sensitive data and technologies. President Xi Jinping 's government has been rolling out incentives in an apparent bid to win over Taiwanese and Taiwan businesses , without having to resort to a harder stance. "Everything else having failed, Xi may therefore feel compelled to put a premium on a military strategy in the Taiwan Strait," said Cole in the report. "The two pillars of Beijing's strategy toward Taiwan, coercion and incentivization, have failed to arrest ongoing trends in Taiwan supporting independence and a democratic form of governance," Cole wrote. "Everything else having failed, the Chinese leadership could become more inclined to use force against the object of its desire." In May, Chinese premier Li Keqiang left out the word "peaceful" when he referred to Beijing's perennial desire to "reunify" Taiwan with the mainland. It broke with a decades-old practice, and was noted by China watchers. The situation is "delicate" as Taiwan is an area of "core interest" to China, Schell told CNBC. Beijing will not be willing to accord any compromise or flexibility when it comes to the position of Taiwan, he added. The role of the U.S. also adds to the situation. Washington does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taipei but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. The U.S. has been stepping up its sailings through the Taiwan Strait in recent months, according to Reuters. A U.S. military aircraft also entered Taiwan air space with permission from the Taiwanese in June, a move that angered China . Both China and Taiwan have been beefing up their defense capabilities. The mainland has been developing new amphibious assault ships and aircrafts.  Taiwan has also been boosting its defense industry with the test flight of a homegrown jet in June. Taipei has also been displaying its military might — most recently with its annual war games in July. "The Chinese recognize that in the near-term, they do not have the capacity to really 'retake' Taiwan, not only militarily, but in particular economically and politically," said Rodger Baker, senior vice president of strategic analysis at Stratfor, a consultancy. China also can't afford to take such any action "that would guarantee that the rest of the world rallies against China," Baker told CNBC. What China would most likely continue doing is intensify and accelerate steps to isolate Taiwan internationally by pressuring others, he said. The mainland has already pressured many of Taiwan's diplomatic allies to cut ties with the island. Solomon Islands and Kiribati were among the latest to switch sides in September last year, leaving Taipei with just 15 allies remaining. Just last month, the Chinese foreign ministry said at a scheduled press conference that Beijing would sanction U.S. weapons-maker Lockheed Martin for selling arms to Taiwan. The company is the main contractor for a $620 million missile upgrade package for the island that was approved by the U.S. government. Lockheed Martin told Reuters at the time that foreign military sales are government-to-government transaction. "We have seen over the years ... not a scintilla of evidence of flexibility on these kinds of core interest questions, and that's what makes Taiwan so dangerous," said Schell.
China's top diplomat has called out the U.S. for attempting to start a new Cold War between the two largest economies, and in the process plunging the world into "chaos and division." Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told state media Xinhua News Agency that China is not the former Soviet Union and has "no intention of becoming another United States." Wang said relations between the two countries are "facing the gravest challenge since the establishment of diplomatic ties" and blamed the U.S. for that deterioration.	China's top diplomat has called out the U.S. for attempting to start a new Cold War between the two largest economies, and in the process plunging the world into "chaos and division." In an interview with state media Xinhua News Agency on Wednesday, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said "today's China is not the former Soviet Union." He added that his country has "no intention of becoming another United States." "We have no intention of becoming another United States. China does not export ideology, and never interferes in other countries' internal affairs," he said. The official English translation of the interview transcript was released on Xinhua's website. The interview covered various flashpoints in the U.S.-China relationship, including semi-autonomous Chinese territory Hong Kong, Chinese tech firm Huawei and the disputed South China Sea. Several American officials have warned that China wants to replace the U.S. as the world's dominant power. Such sentiment in the U.S. culminated in a series of recent speeches by top officials — including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security advisor Robert O'Brien — which called out China for its attempt in upending the global order. China has repeatedly denied that it's seeking to replace the U.S., and in turn accused Washington for trying to stop its ascent in the world. Wang said relations between the two countries are "facing the gravest challenge since the establishment of diplomatic ties" and blamed the U.S. for that deterioration. "The root cause is that some American politicians who are biased against and hostile to China are using their power to smear China with fabrications and impede normal ties with China under various pretexts," he said. The contest between the U.S. and China has dominated much of global attention over the last few years. Two years ago, the two countries entered a damaging trade war that resulted in elevated tariffs being slapped on each other's products worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Tensions between the two spilled into the technology space, with the U.S. accusing Huawei — and later TikTok, a video-sharing app owned by ByteDance — for threatening American national security. Washington has tried to pressure its allies to ban Huawei from their countries' 5G networks. Wang called such moves by the U.S. a "textbook example of bullying" and a violation of "international rules of fair trade." In contrast, he stressed that China is a "firm defender" of the international system.
Political uncertainties in several Southeast Asian countries could threaten their recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, said Simon Tay, chairman of think tank Singapore Institute of International Affairs. "There is a concern that without political will and unity, some countries are going to be much worse off," Tay said, citing Malaysia and Thailand as examples. The stability of the new Malaysian government is being questioned, while Thailand lost its key economic architects at a time when the economy is being slammed by the coronavirus pandemic.	Political uncertainties in several Southeast Asian countries are coming to the forefront again, which could threaten their recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, an expert said on Friday. Some of those uncertainties took a backseat when authorities around the region imposed lockdowns of varying degrees to slow the spread of the coronavirus. As those measures are gradually lifted and domestic politicking resumes, the stability of some governments are in question once more, said Simon Tay, chairman of think tank Singapore Institute of International Affairs. "There is a concern that without political will and unity, some countries are going to be much worse off. It's not a health concern, this is really economic, governance et cetera," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia." Tay, who's also a law professor at the National University of Singapore, cited Malaysia as an example of a country where politics could hamper its recovery. The country had a change in government shortly before it entered a lockdown in March — following defections from the former ruling coalition that resulted in its collapse. But the stability and legitimacy of the new government has come under question, with several media outlets reporting that a snap election could soon be called for the current ruling coalition to seek a new mandate. "There are lots of different politicking about small issues but it adds up to a big question mark about the political stability and the political attention to dealing with both economic and other (issues)," said Tay. "And Thailand next door — large economy for our region — they're having the same problem: the economic team is gone, another's being ushered in. But the contraction of the economy is very real, very now," he added. Several Thai ministers resigned last month , including the country's key economic architects. New ministers have reportedly been appointed but the change has come at a time when the tourism-dependent Thai economy is slammed by the coronavirus pandemic, which brought global travel to a halt. Malaysia and Thailand are among Southeast Asian countries that have reported a slowdown in daily new Covid-19 cases, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Covid-19 is the official name of the coronavirus disease. Still, some economists warned that most countries in the region would still find it challenging to grow their economies given the global uncertainties — regardless of their success in containing the outbreak. Earlier this week, Nomura's chief Asean economist, Euben Paracuelles, said the region could experience a "U-shape" recovery at best . A U-shape recovery typically means an economy spends a longer time at the bottom of a recession before it gradually rebounds.
India's border clash with China in June is likely to accelerate a trend where New Delhi continues to build and strengthen strategic partnerships with the United States and others to protect its national interests. That includes strengthening ties with the United States, Japan and Australia as part of an informal strategic dialogue known as the Quad. Experts argue that establishing closer ties with members of the Quad does not go against India's strategic autonomy, and that none of the four countries involved would seek to turn the partnership into a formalized military alliance.	India's border clash with China in June is likely to accelerate a trend where New Delhi continues to build and strengthen strategic partnerships with the United States and others to protect its national interests, experts told CNBC. The stand-off in the Himalayas began in May and a violent June face-off killed 20 Indian soldiers , putting pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to respond. China did not disclose if there were casualties on its side. Former diplomats and political commentators have said the altercation in June was a " turning point " in one of Asia's most important bilateral relationships. For its part, New Delhi introduced measures in recent months aimed at either sidelining or banning Chinese companies from one of the world's largest consumer markets, including restricting Chinese investments into India even before the border clash happened. "The border clash with China is likely to accelerate a trend that was already happening," Akhil Bery, South Asia analyst at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, told CNBC. On the international front, experts said that New Delhi is aiming to strengthen its various bilateral and multilateral partnerships. That includes the important India-U.S. relationship, which is said to have progressed well in recent years, as well as New Delhi's strategic partnership with Moscow and bilateral ties with the European Union. One of the areas in India's efforts to shore up its external ties is the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue — an informal strategic dialogue between the United States, India, Japan and Australia , known commonly as the Quad. Language used by the U.S. State Department describes the Quad's "collective efforts to advance a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific." "Clearly, a major plank in external balancing is that to strengthen the unity and cohesion of the quadrilateral partnership," Rajiv Bhatia, a distinguished fellow in the foreign policy studies program at think-tank Gateway House, told CNBC. Bhatia was also the former Indian ambassador to Myanmar and Mexico. "Quite a few steps have been taken and I think my research shows that this cohesion would go up in the same proportion as China shows its aggressiveness towards these four countries, in particular, and the region in general," he said. Historically, India has always maintained a level of strategic autonomy in the way it conducted foreign policy. That meant New Delhi avoided being part of any formal alliances as it pursued its interests at an international level. Experts argue that establishing closer ties with members of the Quad does not go against India's strategic autonomy, and that none of the four countries involved would seek to turn the partnership into a formalized military alliance. There has been a shift in India's position where New Delhi doesn't necessarily see the need to choose between strategic autonomy and strategic partnerships, according to Harsh Pant, head of the strategic studies program at the Observer Research Foundation. "There is a growing consensus that it is building strategic partnerships that enhances India's strategic autonomy," he told CNBC, adding that China's recent moves "hasn't left much choice" for New Delhi other than to strengthen its engagement with the Quad. Former ambassador Bhatia explained there is little doubt that India is open to the idea of a stronger diplomatic and political partnership where the first and foremost focus is on "encouraging China to follow international law and international norms." There are ways to deepen cooperation within the Quad, experts said. That includes India inviting Australia to this year's Malabar naval exercises — a trilateral naval exercise between India, the United States and Japan. Though in recent years New Delhi resisted the idea of including Canberra in the joint-exercises out of concern over provoking Beijing, Bhatia said since May, India has "traveled past the stage to worry about China's sensitivity." Other ways that the Quad can strengthen its partnership include greater trade linkages, collaborating on infrastructure development and sharing of intelligence, according to Eurasia Group's Bery. "Other potential areas of cooperation include on cybersecurity, disaster responses and even on counterterrorism," he said by email. Still, China remains a large neighbor. It is one of India's biggest trading partners and had invested prominently into Indian technology start-ups. New Delhi has no choice but to continue engaging with Beijing , experts said. Though the cooperativeness and cordiality seen in recent years between the two nuclear-armed neighbors may not be at the same level as it had once been, according to former ambassador Bhatia. "I think we would see a new chapter in which India would assert itself, India would focus on increasing its economic strength, India would shore up its partnerships, and India would remain resolute militarily. India is essentially ready to live in the new era when the geopolitics of Indo-Pacific has been changing rapidly," he said.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte may be injected with Russia's coronavirus vaccine as early as May 2021, a presidential spokesman reportedly said Thursday. Duterte had earlier this week volunteered to participate in trials for the Russian vaccine, even as scientists and health experts questioned the safety and effectiveness of the drug that has not been extensively tested. The Philippines is among a handful of countries that will take part in a more extensive "phase three" trial for the vaccine, and reportedly aims to begin those trials in October.	Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte may be injected with Russia's coronavirus vaccine as early as May 2021, according to the government's official newswire, which quoted the presidential spokesman on Thursday. Earlier this week, Duterte  volunteered to participate in trials for the Russian vaccine, even as scientists and health experts questioned the safety and effectiveness of the drug. Russia on Tuesday announced it had registered the world's first vaccine for the fast-spreading coronavirus disease, or Covid-19, after less than two months of clinical trials. Data of those trials have not been published. The Philippines is among a handful of countries that will take part in a more extensive "phase three" trial for the vaccine. Philippine News Agency, the government's official newswire, reported that the country aims to begin those trials in October. Phase three trials are considered by medical experts to be critical for any vaccine development and are needed to root out any potential side effects. Such trials, which typically randomize who gets the vaccine and who doesn't, can involve thousands of participants. The Philippines last week overtook Indonesia to report the highest number of cumulative coronavirus cases in Southeast Asia, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University showed. As of Thursday afternoon, the country has reported 143,749 cases and 2,404 deaths, according to Hopkins data. Duterte last month pleaded with China to make his country a priority as it develops a vaccine, reported Reuters . J. Stephen Morrison of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" Wednesday that it's no surprise Russian President Vladimir Putin offered Russia's vaccine to Duterte. Morrison is a senior vice president at CSIS and director of the think tank's Global Health Policy Center. "Putin is also playing on the anxiety within lower-income and lower middle-income countries that the rich countries are locking up all the supplies of vaccines coming out of these other major outlets, and that they're going to be left at the back of the queue with long, lengthy and highly damaging delays," he said. — CNBC's Berkeley Lovelace Jr. contributed to this report.
"We are ... seeing U.S.-China tensions mounting, which is unhelpful to Hong Kong, and also to the trade between U.S. and China. But as we are fighting the pandemic, I think the last thing one would want is a further distraction that would disturb or disrupt the trade," Edward Yau told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Monday. He pointed to the "economic scorecard across the Pacific," which shows a "very strong" correlation between how well a country has contained the outbreak versus its economic performance. Hong Kong's growth slowed to an "unprecedented" 9% decline in the second quarter, Yau said. The city's economy has been pummeled on a few fronts since last year.	U.S.-China tensions are not good for Hong Kong, said the city's secretary for commerce and economic development, as he urged everyone to recognize that the "common enemy" of the world is the coronavirus pandemic. "We are ... seeing U.S.-China tensions mounting, which is unhelpful to Hong Kong, and also to the trade between U.S. and China. But as we are fighting the pandemic, I think the last thing one would want is a further distraction that would disturb or disrupt the trade," Edward Yau told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Monday. He pointed to the "economic scorecard across the Pacific," which shows a "very strong" correlation between how well a country has contained the outbreak versus its economic performance. He cited China as an example, where its economy was among the earliest to bounce back, after being the first hit in the pandemic. But some other economies in the region have been hit by double-digit growth declines. Hong Kong's growth slowed to an "unprecedented" 9% decline in the second quarter, Yau said. The city's economy has been pummeled on a few fronts: pro-democracy protests, which hurt businesses and tourism badly, and now the coronavirus. The city saw a flare-up in cases again recently, leading to restrictions being reimposed. "If we are not able to contain Covid-19 individually and collectively, I think we are all bearing the toll. So either way, I'm saying that well, perhaps the economic tsunami arising from the Covid-19 … I think that's something that we have to watch, in particular for Hong Kong being so internationalized, so intertwined with our trade with the globe," Yau said. "I think we're highly conscious that well, we should be taking every step to combat Covid-19, and also to ease any tensions which (are) unnecessary and unwarranted." The relationship between Washington and Beijing has worsened this year, as both countries squabble over a range of issues from the origins of the pandemic, to a controversial national security law and China's claims of ownership in the South China Sea. Hong Kong has been caught up in the quarrel. After Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong, Washington said it would revoke the city's special trading status with the U.S. That has raised fears that Hong Kong's status as a financial hub could be eroded . Additionally, the U.S. government announced last week that goods made in the city and exported to the U.S. will need to be labeled as made in China instead of Hong Kong after Sept. 25. When asked about that development, Yau referred to World Trade Organization rules which state that Hong Kong is entitled to use its own labeling for its exports, adding that it will "take the matter up with the U.S." "We must recognize that the common enemy … for the entire world … is the pandemic, is the virus, not each other," he said. "Unfortunately I think we are being dragged into the tensions on the geopolitical basis. But of course Hong Kong will soldier on."
"What has happened in Hong Kong has lost Taiwan for China forever," said David Roche, president and global strategist at consultancy Independent Strategy. Even though China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its rule, Roche said he doubts Beijing would go down that route for fear of worsening relations with the U.S.	China may never "reunify" with Taiwan now that the central government in Beijing has tightened its control over Hong Kong, one strategist said on Monday. "In a sense, the big price that China's paying for Hong Kong is actually Taiwan," David Roche, president and global strategist at consultancy Independent Strategy, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia."  China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and sees the democratic self-ruled island as a runaway province. The Chinese Communist Party has never governed the island, but has sought to push Taiwan to accept Beijing's rule under a "one country, two systems" framework . Hong Kong is a former British colony now governed by China under a "one country, two systems" principle, which grants the Chinese territory a largely separate economic and legal system, and allows those living there limited election rights. Large-scale pro-democracy protests — which sometimes turned violent — engulfed Hong Kong for much of last year. That partly led China to implement a national security law in Hong Kong, which raised concerns among the city's opposition politicians and activists World leaders such as the U.K.'s Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab , and U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo have also spoken out against the law. Roche said those developments in Hong Kong could push Taiwan further away from China. "What has happened in Hong Kong has lost Taiwan for China forever," he said. Even though China has never renounced the use of military  force to bring Taiwan under its rule, Roche said he doubts Beijing would go down that route. That's because China risks worsening ties with the U.S. if it takes Taiwan by force, said Roche, who likened current relations between the world's two largest economies to a cold war. U.S. and China relations have deteriorated in recent months, with both sides clashing over a wide range of issues including the origin of the coronavirus , Hong Kong's autonomy and national security concerns over Chinese tech companies. Taiwan has also remained a contentious issue in bilateral ties between the two countries. Washington does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taipei but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. "Despite the non-existence of a formal treaty between the U.S. and Taiwan for mutual defense – or defense of Taiwan by America – in reality, if there was any such move by China militarily against Taiwan, the U.S. would most definitely act," said Roche. That would move U.S.-China relations "from cold war to hot war," he said. — CNBC's Huileng Tan contributed to this report.
The UAE and Israel agreed to normalize diplomatic relations last week. Tzachi Hanegbi, a minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, said Gulf countries recognized that Israel was one of the few powers that was challenging Iran.	Many Gulf states, including the United Arab Emirates, see Israel as an "asset" because the country stands up to Iran, an Israeli minister said Tuesday, following last week's agreement for the UAE and Israel to normalize diplomatic relations. In a deal brokered by the U.S., the two countries would establish diplomatic ties, and Israel would pause its efforts to annex portions of the West Bank. Turkey and Palestinian officials criticized the deal, but the UAE's minister of state for foreign affairs called it a "win-win solution." Iran is a common adversary of a number of countries in the Middle East, including Israel, the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Tzachi Hanegbi, a minister in the Israeli prime minister's office, said Gulf countries recognized that Israel was one of the few powers that was challenging the "ongoing terrorist activity and terrorist policy by Iran." "They feel fragile, they feel, in a way, neglected," he told CNBC's "Capital Connection," pointing to the "scandalous decision" by the United Nations to not extend the arms embargo on Iran. He said Tehran was "still trying to take over the Middle East through bullying the Arab states." "They see Israel not only as a friend, they see us as an asset because we stand up to the Iranians, we fight them whenever it's possible in Syria, in Lebanon or other places. We're not ready to surrender to the whims of the Iranian regime," he added. Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. President Donald Trump last year designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization . Tehran retaliated by naming the United States a terrorism supporter and Centcom, the U.S. Central Command, a terrorist group. A Brookings Institution article earlier this year said Iran's support for numerous insurgent and rebel groups in the Middle East are an important part of the country's foreign policy. Hanegbi described the UAE deal as a "breakthrough" and said now was the time for the two "innovative" countries to find common denominators in various fields. "In agriculture, in medicine, in trade, in energy — there are so many places where both of us can mutually benefit each other, and it really begins now," he said, noting that an Israeli firm and an Emirati company had agreed to cooperate on Covid-19 research. "(The) sky's the limit, in this sense." The UAE is only the third Arab country to have open diplomatic relations with Israel, and Hanegbi expressed hope for a treaty with Palestinians. Peace talks between the two sides collapsed in 2014. He said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's strategy was to build relationships with other Arab leaders instead of waiting for negotiations to restart. "Maybe this will convince the Palestinians that it's time for them to do whatever Jordan and Egypt, now the UAE are willing to do. To see Israelis not as enemies but as friends, as assets to their well being, technology, security," he said. "We are very hopeful that maybe Palestinian leaders will now join forces with other Arab leaders and come back, negotiate with us." The minister said a deal was "essential" because Israelis live with Palestinians. "They are not going to disappear, we are not going to disappear. We have to find a way to get a historic compromise with the Palestinians." Acknowledging that Palestinian officials called the UAE-Israel deal a "betrayal," Hanegbi said it was frustrating and sad. "They should be happy that the Arab world comes to its senses and understands that only by peaceful meeting, by cooperation, you will ensure the well-being of the people of this region," he added. — CNBC's Natasha Turak contributed to this report.
"A Biden presidency — if he were to win — will result in more certain policymaking, foreign policymaking," according to Nomura's Rob Subbaraman. Biden formally became his party's nominee for president late Tuesday at the virtual Democratic National Convention. He added that a Biden presidency could potentially focus on higher taxes and being tougher on tech companies, which would be "more negative" for markets stateside relative to elsewhere.	If Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wins the upcoming elections in November that could be a boon for Asia, according to Nomura's Rob Subbaraman. "For Asia specifically, if Biden wins, I think it will be actually positive," he told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Tuesday. "A Biden presidency — if he were to win — will result in more certain policymaking, foreign policymaking," said Subbaraman, who is head of global macro research at Nomura. "That's been very lacking and I think there'll be more coalition building. I think that it will be more generally favorable for the region." While the analyst said he expects Biden to "be tough" on China on more issues than just trade, he said the former U.S. vice president would be "positive for the rest of the world" overall. Tensions between the U.S. and China have risen sharply under incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump . The disputes between the world's two economic superpowers range from trade to alleged concerns over national security, drawing companies like Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei into the crossfire . Biden formally became his party's nominee for president late Tuesday at the virtual Democratic National Convention . Subbaraman said, however, that U.S. markets could take a hit under a Biden presidency. "I think there will be a lot more focus on income redistribution in the U.S., which will not be good for U.S. markets," Subbaraman said. He added that a Biden presidency could potentially focus on higher taxes and being tougher on tech companies, which would be "more negative" for markets stateside relative to elsewhere. The S&P 500 on Tuesday rose to a new record closing high , recovering from its slump in March, when the coronavirus pandemic left economies across the world effectively frozen as social distancing measures were implemented by authorities.
Whoever succeeds Shinzo Abe as Japan's next prime minister is set for a "difficult year" ahead, according to Teneo Intelligence's Tobias Harris. For his part, Abe has said he would fulfill his duties as prime minister until the next leader is appointed. His current term was not due to end until September 2021. Keio University Professor Tomohiko Taniguchi told CNBC Monday that it is "very much difficult to say" who could succeed Abe at this moment.	Whoever succeeds Shinzo Abe as Japan's next prime minister is set for a "difficult year" ahead, Teneo Intelligence's Tobias Harris told CNBC in an email. The analyst said the next leader needs to address pressing, "significant issues" after Abe's surprise resignation of long-standing incumbent on Friday. Harris said that includes a "wide-open debate" about Japan's national security strategy as well as new defense program guidelines and negotiations with the U.S. over host-nation support. "The next prime minister will also either have to prepare to deal with a reelected Trump or the transition to a new US administration, either of which will occupy much of his or her attention," the analyst said, referring to the U.S. presidential election in early November. Still, Harris said Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will "likely move quickly to select a new leader to ensure stability and continuity" in a time when the country is hit by both recession as well the coronavirus pandemic. Abe's departure risks leaving a "political vacuum" in Japan, Waqas Adenwala, Asia analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, warned in a Monday note. "(Abe's) current term has been characterised by strong leadership and an absence of political turmoil in contrast to the instability of previous administrations," Adenwala said. "Intra-party unity within the LDP will deteriorate as heads of different party factions will attempt to promote a succession candidate from within their own ranks." For his part, Abe has said he would fulfill his duties as prime minister until the next leader is appointed. His current term was not due to end until September 2021. At present, it is "very much difficult to say" who could succeed Abe as Japan's next prime minsiter, Keio University Professor Tomohiko Taniguchi told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" Monday. According to a Kyodo News survey, former defense chief Shigeru Ishiba is the most popular choice to takeover from Abe . Other names reportedly in the running include Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, described by Taniguchi as a man who is known to be a "hardworking, diligent politician" who has "done quite a lot" alongside Abe on domestic policies. Regardless of who succeeds Abe, however, Oxford Economics' Shigeto Nagai said Japanese economic policy will likely see "no change" as long as the shock from the coronavirus pandemic remains. "With the national election approaching, any successor from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has no choice but to continue active fiscal policy to protect vulnerable people and firms from the unprecedented disaster and opposition parties will not oppose," said Nagai, who is head of Japan economics at the firm. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan is expected to continue its "whatever-it-takes" approach toward supporting corporate financing and financial market stability, the economist said. "As for long-standing structural issues such as fiscal consolidation to cope with aging, this is not the right timing to initiate any new initiatives," Nagai said.

Milos Vystrcil will "pay a heavy price" for making an official trip to Taiwan, and China will not sit idly by, the Chinese government's top diplomat said on Monday. Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi gave no details on how exactly Beijing would react. Vystrcil arrived in Taipei on Sunday on a visit to promote business links with Taiwan.	Czech Senate speaker Milos Vystrcil will "pay a heavy price" for making an official trip to Taiwan and China will not sit idly by, the Chinese government's top diplomat said on Monday, in a warning brushed off by Taiwan's government. Vystrcil arrived in Taipei on Sunday on a visit to promote business links with Taiwan, saying the Czech Republic would not bow to Beijing's objections. Speaking while in Germany, Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi said there would be retribution. "The Chinese government and Chinese people won't take a laissez-faire attitude or sit idly by, and will make him pay a heavy price for his short-sighted behaviour and political opportunism," China's Foreign Ministry cited Wang as saying. Wang said the Chinese government and people will not tolerate such "open provocation" by Vystrcil and the anti-China forces behind him, though gave no details of how exactly Beijing would react. Speaking in Taipei, Taiwan Economics Minister Wang Mei-hua brushed off the criticism, though declined direct comment on China's attack on Vystrcil. "The Czech Republic and Taiwan are free and democratic countries which put great store on human rights. We have the same values as the Czechs," she told reporters, speaking before a joint business forum. Vystrcil did not directly address China's criticism of his visit in a brief speech at the same event, talking instead about how he was aiming to boost business relations. "Freedom and democracy are the main basis of prosperity," he said, speaking through an interpreter. Vystrcil is due to meet Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen later in his trip and will address Taiwan's parliament before leaving on Friday. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province ineligible for state-to-state relations. Czech President Milos Zeman has sought closer business and political ties with China since taking office in 2013, but his efforts have been hit by failed investment plans and Czech wavering about allowing China's Huawei Technologies to play a role in developing next-generation telecoms networks.
"Trump is not the American president America deserves, in my opinion. But he definitely is the American president China deserved," the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist told CNBC on Tuesday. "We needed to have a president who was going to call the game with China. And Trump has done it," Friedman said on "Squawk Box." Still, Friedman said he believes Trump should have built a broader coalition with American allies to take on China over trade practices and other geopolitical issues.	New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman told CNBC on Tuesday he applauds President Donald Trump 's decision to take a harder stance on China than previous commanders in chief. "Donald Trump is not the American president America deserves, in my opinion. But he definitely is the American president China deserved," Friedman said on "Squawk Box." "We needed to have a president who was going to call the game with China. And Trump has done it, with I would say more grit and toughness than any of his predecessors. I give him credit for that." At the same time, Friedman said he believes the way Trump sought to confront China over international trade and other geopolitical issues would have been more constructive if he had brought along American allies from the outset. "[Trump] thought he could do it alone. He thought he could do it without a coalition," the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist said. "Remember, it was the country that had the biggest coalition that won World War I. It was country that had the biggest coalition that won World War II. It was the country that had the healthiest coalition that won the Cold War, and it will be same with China." Despite his analogies, Friedman said he was not "looking for a war" between the U.S. and China. But the world's two largest economies are engaged in a critical "struggle," he contended. "I've always felt from the beginning that if we made this challenge with China, the United States alone versus China, we will lose," said Friedman, who works at what Trump has repeatedly called "the failing New York Times" for what the president considers a liberal bent at the media organization. "If we make it the world versus China, on what are the right and fair rules of international commerce and technology in the 21st century, we can win." Friedman, while critical of Trump on many issues, wrote in 2018 that the economic fight with China is "worth having," adding the president's "instinct is basically right" to hold the line "before China gets too big." Trump, who is seeking reelection in November, has adopted a sharply critical stance on China during his first term in the White House. He set off a major trade dispute that resulted in the two nations placing billions of dollars of import tariffs on each other's goods before reaching a phase one trade deal. More recently, Trump has focused his ire on Chinese technology companies, accusing them of presenting national security risks to the U.S. The Chinese firms have denied the various allegations. The administration has placed tight restrictions on telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies, and more recently taken steps to restrict access in the U.S. for two popular apps owned by Chinese tech firms, ByteDance's TikTok and Tencent's WeChat. Friedman said there are numerous concerns over how technology is used across the world, noting that years ago the U.S. government reportedly breached Huawei's own network as part of an intelligence gathering operation. Technology is only getting more sophisticated, with household items potentially being "dual use" for civilian and military purposes, he said. "There needs to be a kind of global conversation between the [European Union], America and China over how we're going to do this, otherwise we're heading for a ... digital Berlin Wall," Friedman said. "The world will be less stable and it'll be less prosperous if that's where we go."
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced his resignation citing poor health last week, but his main economic strategy — a range of stimulus policies known as Abenomics — will likely survive. His likely successor, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, has said he would "maintain and push forward" with the strategy that involves large-scale monetary policy easing, fiscal spending and structural reforms. Among the unfinished business that Abe will leave behind include bringing down Japan's public debt and tackling long-term structural problems such as excessive bureaucracy, said analysts.	Outgoing Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is stepping down with much unfinished business in reviving the world's third-largest economy — leaving his successor to pick up the slack. Abe last Friday announced his resignation over poor health . But his signature economic strategy — a range of stimulus policies known as Abenomics — will likely survive not in the least because his close aide, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, has emerged as a front-runner to be Japan's next prime minister. Suga has said he would "maintain and push forward" with Abenomics, which involve large-scale monetary policy easing, fiscal spending and structural reforms. But even if an Abe critic takes office, analysts said the coronavirus pandemic has left little room for the government to make drastic policy changes. That will give investors the peace of mind that stability will persist in Japan. "From the perspective of markets, investors are looking for stability, continuity," Kathy Matsui, vice chair and chief Japan strategist at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Wednesday. "Japan's political history is marred by this rapid turnstile of leaders," she said. "The biggest fear ... is to go back to that pattern of constant change at the top because when you have that turnover, obviously it's much more difficult to implement, especially, much needed structural reforms." But "the track record of Abenomics is mixed at best," said Josh Lipsky, director of the global business and economics program at think tank Atlantic Council. He explained in a note last week that while Japan did grow, some policy goals were not achieved. Abe came into office in late 2012 with grand plans to lift Japan's economy out of decades of stagnation. Japan, once a bustling economy, experienced a major slowdown in growth during what became known as the "lost decade" from around 1991 to 2001. Abenomics helped accelerate growth again, though not at the rate Japan once saw and the size of the economy is still short of the 600 trillion yen ($5.6 trillion) target set by Abe's government. But many analysts credited the outgoing prime minister for putting the Japanese economy in a stronger position today to withstand the shock from the coronavirus pandemic. "Abenomics did create growth and avoided the worst case-scenarios for Japanese economy," said Lipsky. But the pandemic threatens to wipe out much of those economic gains, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting a 5.8% contraction in Japan's gross domestic product this year. The most successful aspect of Abenomics is the large-scale monetary easing by the Bank of Japan , said analysts. The BOJ's unconventional measures such as asset purchases and yield curve control have entered the tool kit of other central banks. Such monetary easing boosted stock prices and weakened the yen — helping Japanese companies dependent on exports to expand their profits. "Abenomics has been effective in supporting large firms by boosting equity markets and nurturing the sense of stability that a sharp appreciation of the yen will not happen again," said Shigeto Nagai, head of Japan economics at Oxford Economics. "During Abe's time in office, the profitability of large firms has risen significantly, by expanding their business abroad," he wrote in a report last week. Those benefits to large businesses have not raised wages enough to spur households to spend, said Nagai. "Without a sufficient rise in wages, the benefits of Abenomics were not shared by households, and thus failed to stimulate domestic demand. Abenomics did not stop the secular stagnation in household incomes," he explained. That leaves the BOJ's 2% inflation target elusive for now, although the policies brought an end to deflation. The lack of inflation is not unique to Japan, with other developed markets — including the U.S. — similarly finding it challenging to raise prices despite solid economic growth. But some economists said the pandemic-induced crisis, which has dampened demand further, could bring Japanese inflation back into negative territory. While Abenomics involved an increase in government spending to support growth, the strategy also aimed to achieve a budget surplus and bring down debt over the long term. That's a task made even more difficult by the coronavirus pandemic, according to analysts. "Fiscal policy has been anything but tight this year," said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics. He explained in a Tuesday note that there's been more spending to support firms and households in the current crisis. "As such, the budget deficit is set to surge," he added. Even before the pandemic, Japan's government debt — at more than 200% of GDP — was already the highest among countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Some analysts said such a debt pile could limit any further fiscal spending, which would in turn compromise Japan's recovery. Over the longer term, Japan's next prime minister will have to tackle structural challenges that Abe has left largely unaddressed. "Abe has succeeded in promoting corporate governance reform and in increasing the share of women, seniors, and foreigners in the labour force," said Learmouth. "But the structural reforms with the most potential to lift productivity growth have not been addressed." He singled out Japan's "excessive bureaucracy" as the most likely area for "widespread change in the near term." That problem caused frustration among the public when households and businesses had to wait a long time before receiving government support during the pandemic — which contributed to waning support for Abe's cabinet before his resignation, explained Learmouth. "As such, there will be pressure on Mr Abe's successor to reform Japan's complex and undigitised admin systems that drag on productivity," he added. "Such reforms have the potential to lift trend growth."
On Wednesday, India banned 118 Chinese apps including major hit games from Tencent and NetEase as well as services from the likes of Baidu and Alibaba affiliate Ant Group. The broader crackdown on Chinese technology opens opportunities for U.S. technology giants like Facebook and Apple in India. One analyst said Washington and New Delhi "may foster one of the most important relationships in the 21st century."	India's crackdown on Chinese apps could help the country's homegrown technology firms grow, analysts told CNBC. This also presents an opportunity for U.S. giants which have long seen the world's fifth-largest economy as critical to their future growth prospects, they said. On Wednesday, India banned 118 Chinese apps including major hit games from Tencent and NetEase as well as services from the likes of Baidu and Alibaba affiliate, Ant Group . India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology claimed the apps were "engaged in activities which is prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity" of the country. The government also alleged these services sent citizens' data to servers located outside of India. Earlier in June, India banned 59 Chinese apps . Tensions between the two nations have been on the rise since June, when a border clash left 20 Indian soldiers dead in the disputed Himalayan mountain border in the region of Ladakh. And those tensions have been flaring up again . "Chinese firms are learning a painful lesson. And, that is, the foreign policy of China has hijacked their business. China's geopolitics with India has led to a nationwide fallout for Chinese firms," Abishur Prakash, a geopolitical specialist at the Center for Innovating the Future (CIF), a Toronto, Canada-based consulting firm, told CNBC by email. The Indian government has specifically targeted apps. But Bloomberg reported last month that Chinese telecoms equipment makers Huawei and ZTE are also set to be shut out of India's 5G trials. If it happens, India would be following others — including Australia and the U.K. — in excluding Huawei from its next-generation mobile networks. The crackdown on Chinese technology presents opportunities for both Indian and U.S. tech firms. "Certainly, we have seen the Indians taking even a more aggressive stance on banning Chinese apps, Chinese technology, than the United States has proffered in its battle with the Chinese," Rodger Baker, senior vice president of strategic analysis at Stratfor, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Thursday. "Part of that is the Indians trying to stir their own domestic technology, really incentivize the development of their technology sector and try to position themselves also as a place for other countries to be able to invest in technology development." India has proved attractive to China's technology firms as they have looked to expand outside their domestic market. Chinese investors and companies have been investing in local companies, putting in an estimated $4 billion into Indian start-ups, according to think tank Gateway House . And 18 of India's 30 so-called unicorns — or start-ups valued at over $1 billion — are now Chinese-funded. Chinese apps like short video-sharing platform TikTok, meanwhile, have managed to challenge big U.S. giants like Facebook and Google , while Chinese smartphone makers like Xiaomi have cemented leading positions in India. So there is a lot on the line, not just for Chinese technology companies in India but start-ups relying on money from the world's second-largest economy. "Chinese technology firms know that the days of expanding freely across the world are over," Prakash said. But it also presents an opportunity for American giants in India, a market they've touted as a major future growth driver and one they've tried to crack with varying degrees of success. "The banning of Chinese apps leaves a big gap to fill for the industry," Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. "It offers more opportunities for established players from U.S. and elsewhere to expand market share. For example, banning on TikTok is benefiting Instagram Reels," he added, referring to Instagram's TikTok rival . India's backlash against Chinese technology comes as the U.S. continues to put pressure on China's biggest firms.  In August, President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transactions with Tencent and ByteDance, the owner of TikTok. Washington earlier this year also amended a rule that looks to cut Huawei off from critical semiconductor supplies. "Both India and U.S. are seeing their interests converge. Prime Minister Modi's biggest rule is self-reliance. From defense to e-commerce, he doesn't want India reliant on anything foreign. And, while India has built its own domestic software industry, it lags in hardware, like chips," Prakash said. "At the same time, U.S. firms are looking for a new base to build hardware and a new consumer base to take their products to. It's a win-win." Silicon Valley's tech giants have been looking to expand their presence in India. Apple , which only has a 1% market share in the country, started selling iPhone XR phones assembled in India last year. The Cupertino giant also said it was "eager" to open its first retail store in India . India's smartphone market is dominated by Xiaomi and Samsung which collectively have over 50% market share, according to Counterpoint Research. Counterpoint's Shah said Apple is not just seeing India as a key market for smartphone demand but also as a manufacturing location as it looks to reduce reliance on China. "India has more than half a billion smartphone users and second largest smartphone market in the world, and with consumers buying their third or fourth smartphone in (the) coming years, they tend to buy a better phone which opens up opportunities for Apple in premium segment," Shah said. "Further with anti-China sentiment, it could eventually work in Apple's favor as currently (in) the premium segment, OnePlus is giving tough competition to Apple." OnePlus is a phone brand owned by Chinese firm BBK Electronics. Meanwhile, India has proved popular for Facebook and its WhatsApp messaging service, as well as Google 's Android and YouTube video platform. Both Facebook and Google recently invested over $10 billion collectively into Indian digital services firm Jio Platforms. Jio Platforms has a number of brands including its telecommunications business Reliance Jio which has grown rapidly, thanks to competitive pricing  to become the number one mobile carrier in India by revenue and subscriber base. The investment was seen as a way for both technology giants to get a bigger foothold in the Indian market. "Google and Facebook, unlike Apple don't have access to (the) world's largest smartphone market China. So India is the only large, huge scale smartphone market for these companies," Shah said. "So partnering with India's largest, most ambitious and influential telco, gives them a great partner to cement their position and scale in the Indian market." While the latest India-China tensions may dent Chinese tech firms' ambitions in India, it's unlikely to stop their global expansion, but Chinese firms may be more selective, CIF's Prakash said. "They may start building products and services exclusively for certain markets, instead of for the world. This will intensify geopolitical competition between U.S. and China, as Chinese firms build a bigger footprint in certain regions," Prakash said. India is also pushing its own homegrown technology agenda under Modi. While India and the U.S. may be aligned on their pressure on Chinese technology, the relationship could be fragile. "In the short term, through technology, New Delhi and Washington may foster one of the most important relationships in the 21st century. But, in the long term, because of technology, U.S. and India may find themselves in a place similar to where the U.S. and China are today," Prakash said.
